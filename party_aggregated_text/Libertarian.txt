Wyllie is co-host and producer of the network’s flagship program, ''Liberty Underground'', which airs on four AM and one FM radio stations, and can be heard in eight states. ''Liberty Underground'' is broadcast on  1340 AM in , on  1350 in , and  880 AM in .\n\n\nIn a series of investigate reports for the 1787 Network, Wyllie was the first to reveal that Florida law enforcement agencies are now using facial recognition scans taken at the time of driver’s license renewals as a source database for covert video surveillance. In a related investigation, he was the first to report that the Florida Senate had inserted an amendment into a transportation bill that would authorize the introduction of biometric  chips into Florida drivers' licenses.\n\nWyllie also alleged corruption surrounding the , as well as Florida Senator  and others in a series of articles surrounding the treatment of whistle blower Bob Burton. Burton, who recorded an allegedly incriminating telephone conversation with Dean's chief of staff, had his home raided and his alleged evidence seized by the  after attempting to release the recording and other evidence he had gathered.

Napolitano served as a   from 1987 to 1995. He also served as a visiting professor at , , and . He is a  and has gained prominence in part due to his criticism of the administrations of , , and . Beginning in 1997, he became an analyst for , commenting on legal news and trials. He has written nine books on legal and political subjects.\n\n\nNapolitano was born in . He graduated with an A.B. in history from  in 1972 after completing a senior thesis titled \"An Essay on the Origin and Evolution of Representative Government in the Colony of the , 1630-1644.\" He received his  from  and was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1975. After law school, he entered private practice as a litigator. He first taught law for a brief period in 1980–1981 at  (now ). He sat on the  bench from 1987 to 1995, becoming the state's youngest then-sitting Superior Court judge.\n\nNapolitano resigned his judgeship in 1995 to return to private practice. He served as an adjunct professor at  for 11 years, from 1989 to 2000. He served as a visiting professor at  from 2013 to 2017.\n\nNapolitano told friends in 2017 that President  told him he was considering him for a  appointment should there be a second vacancy. Ultimately, Judge  was chosen instead.\n\n\n\nBefore joining Fox as a news analyst, Napolitano was the presiding judge for the first season of 's syndicated court show '''' (2000–02), in which people brought small-claims disputes to a televised courtroom. Differing from similar formats, the  and  were represented '''' by famous attorneys. He departed the series after its first season.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Napolitano co-hosted a  show on  with  titled ''''. He hosted a daily  talk show called '''' that aired on . Frequent guests on ''Freedom Watch'' were Congressman ,  and . He promoted the works of  and  in his program. The show originally aired every Wednesday at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Fox News' ''Strategy Room'' and from September 14, 2009, aired three to four times a week. On June 12, 2010, it debuted as a weekly show on . It was one of several programs dropped in February 2012 when FBN revamped its primetime lineup.\n\nNapolitano regularly substituted for television host  when Beck was absent from his program. After Beck announced that he would be leaving , he asked Napolitano to replace him. He regularly provided legal analysis on top rated shows on both  and , such as '''', '''', '''', '''' with , '''' and '''' until an appearance on March 16, 2017, related to a then-postulated conspiracy theory involving President Trump's accusation that former President  had wiretapped him. On March 20, 2017, the '''' reported that Napolitano was pulled off the air indefinitely because of the wiretapping claims; however, it was unclear whether Napolitano would return to the air or whether it was just a temporary move to remove him from the news cycle. He returned to the air on March 29 and stood by his claims concerning British intelligence. A new book by  reporter  asserts that   met with  boss  in October 2019 to request that Murdoch \"muzzle\" Napolitano and that Napolitano's Fox appearances have been limited since that meeting.\n\nNapolitano was let go from his position as a contributor to Fox News in August 2021 after allegations of sexual harassment filed by a Fox Business production assistant.  During his 24-year tenure as Fox News' Senior Judicial Analyst, Napolitano appeared on air more than 14,500 times, a record for any on-air personality at the network. After his career in TV, Napolitano started his own Youtube show Judge Napolitano - Judging Freedom, which in 2024 had over 400,000 subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\nNapolitano is  and holds that  \"should be prohibited.\" He reasons that while a woman has a natural and undeniable right to privacy in her personal choices, the rule of necessity causes the right to life of the fetus, which he believes to begin at conception, to take priority for the duration of gestation. He believes the Supreme Court's ruling on  in '''' (1967) set a  that would also require  of . He opposes , saying, \"I don't believe that the state has the moral authority to execute.\" He is a believer in the .\n\nWith respect to both presidents  and  and their handling of civil liberties in the , Napolitano is a strong critic. In both his scholarly work, appearing in the  '''', and in his book ''Suicide Pact'', he criticized the actions of both presidents and their parties concerning torture, domestic spying, unilateral executive action and encroachments on political power.\n\nIn February 2014, Napolitano expressed disdain for  on Fox News, saying, \"I am a contrarian on Abraham Lincoln.\" Slavery in the U.S., according to Napolitano, while one of the most deplorable institutions in human history, could have been done away with peacefully, sparing the bloodiest conflict in American history. At the same time, he also argued that states, where slavery was legal, did not secede out of fear of abolitionism, asserting that \"largely the impetus for secession was tariffs,\" which most Civil War historians dispute. In his book ''Suicide Pact'', he focused his criticism of Lincoln on the  set by his specific constitutional violations, such as his unilateral suspension of the right to '''' and his  of military commission systems for civilian crimes.\n\nAfter the release of the  on , Napolitano said the report showed that Trump engaged in numerous instances of . However, the report deliberately refused to make a firm conclusion about obstruction of justice accusations.\n\nAccording to '''', Napolitano \"has a taste for conspiracy theories\". '''' has described him as a \"purveyor of conspiracy theories.\"\n\nIn 2010, Napolitano said, \"It's hard for me to believe that it  () came down by itself... I am gratified to see that people across the board are interested. I think twenty years from now, people will look at 9/11 the way we look at the assassination of JFK today. It couldn't possibly have been done the way the government told us.\"\n\n\nNapolitano subscribes to a   that is influenced by a respect for originalist ideas and methods. He has expressed strong sympathies with the  new originalist vein of , as it incorporates the natural law through an original understanding of the . He has published a favorable column on Barnett's idea of a constitutional presumption of liberty.\n\nNapolitano's philosophy generally leans towards strong originalism while not accepting the limitations of the older types of  espoused by  and Justice  concerning the Constitution's open-ended provisions like the Ninth Amendment. He finds such limitations too restrictive on a judge's ability to apply the natural law to decide cases where the individual's liberty is at stake. He is a strong believer in economic liberties. He argues that '''' was overruled in error in the ''West Coast Hotel'' case, as the Contracts Clause and the  and  due process clauses protect a sphere of personal economic liberty.\n\nIn September 2015, Napolitano was the featured speaker at a conference held by the Republican government watchdog group .\n\n\n\n\nOn March 16, 2017, citing three unnamed intelligence sources, Napolitano said on the program '''' that Britain's top intelligence agency,  (GCHQ), had engaged in covert electronic surveillance of then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign on orders from President Obama. He said that by using the British intelligence apparatus, Obama would avoid leaving \"fingerprints\" that could identify the origin of this surveillance action.\nIn response to “Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmead stating that Napolitano was claiming Trump's phone was “wiretapped”, Napolitano denied actual physical tampering, instead citing the agency has digital access to digital information.\n\nIn a column on the Fox website, he wrote that GCHQ \"most likely provided Obama with transcripts of Trump's calls. The NSA has given GCHQ full 24/7 access to its computers, so GCHQ  a foreign intelligence agency that, like the NSA, operates outside our constitutional norms  has the digital versions of all electronic communications made in America in 2016, including Trump's.\" One of his sources was former  (CIA) officer , who later told  that Napolitano had misrepresented the statements he made on an online discussion board. Johnson, citing two anonymous sources, claimed that the GCHQ was passing information on the Trump campaign to U.S. intelligence through a \"back-channel\", but stressed that the GCHQ did not \"wiretap\" Trump or his associates and that alleged information sharing by the GCHQ was not done at the direction of the Obama administration.\n\nOn March 16,   repeated Napolitano's claim at a White House press briefing. The following day, GCHQ responded with a rare public statement: \"Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\" A British government source said the allegation was \"totally untrue and quite frankly absurd\". Admiral , director of the , said he has seen nothing to suggest that there was \"any such activity,\" nor any request to do so. Former GCHQ director  told the '''' that \"The suggestion that [Barack Obama] asked GCHQ to spy on Trump is just completely barkingthat would be evident to anyone who knew the system.\"\n\nThe claim started a diplomatic dispute with Britain. , the  leader in Britain, said, \"Trump is compromising the vital UK–US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment. This harms our and US security.\" ''The Telegraph'' said that two U.S. officials had personally apologized for the allegation. The British government also said that the U.S. government promised not to repeat these claims. The  denied reports that it had apologized to the British government, saying Spicer was merely \"pointing to public reports\" without endorsing them.\n\nOn April 12, 2017, ''The Guardian'' reported that GCHQ and other European intelligence agencies had intercepted communications between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials and shared the intelligence with their U.S. counterparts. The communications were obtained through \"incidental collection\" as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets, not from a targeted operation against Trump or his campaign.\n\nFox News distanced itself from Napolitano's claims and suspended him from contributing to the network's output, according to the ''Los Angeles Times'' and the . He returned on March 29 after a nearly two-week absence, but continued to support his earlier claims.\n\n\nNapolitano has made numerous claims about the  which are rejected by historians. These claims include that the Civil War was 's war by choice, that slavery was dying anyway, that Lincoln could have freed the slaves by paying the slaveholders, and that Lincoln armed the slaves.&nbsp;More specifically, in a ''Daily Show'' segment, he said that Lincoln started the war \"because he wanted to preserve the union, because he needed the tariffs from the southern states,\" a claim rejected by a panel of three distinguished historians of the Civil War: ,  and . Napolitano argued that Lincoln could have solved the slavery question by paying slaveholders to release their slaves, a method known as , thereby avoiding war. Lincoln did offer to pay to free the slaves in , but the Delaware legislature rejected him. He also asserted that Lincoln attempted to arm slaves, but two prominent historians of the Civil War said they had never heard of such an effort and  rated the claim \"pants-on-fire\". He has asserted that slavery was dying a natural death at the time of the Civil War, a claim that Eric Foner on the ''Daily Show'' panel rejected. Foner said, \"Slavery was not only viable, it was growing ... This idea that it was dying out or was going to die out is ridiculous.\"\n\nNapolitano has also said that Lincoln enforced the  \"until the Civil War was over\" by sending escaped slaves back to their owners. PolitiFact notes that \"while there were cases when Lincoln enforced the law during the Civil War, he did so selectively when he thought it would help keep border states in the Union fold. When it came to slaves from Confederate states, the weight of the government actions fell heavily on the side of refusing to return escaped slaves.\" Furthermore, his claim that Lincoln enforced the act \"until the Civil War was over\" was indisputably false, as the Fugitive Slave Act was repealed in June 1864, more than ten months before the end of the war.\n\n\nNapolitano splits his time living in  and , where he owns a farm that produces .\n\nNapolitano has stated that he is not related to former  , whom he sometimes jokingly calls \"Evil Cousin Janet\".\n\nNapolitano is a .\n\nNapolitano identifies as a  who is opposed to the reforms of  and is critical of .\n\nNapolitano was sued by two New Jersey men alleging sexual assault, in one case arising during his time on the bench. Napolitano countersued in one case bringing a libel case.

Until 2022 he was a , though was expelled from the Thelemic fraternal organization, ; he also identified as a .\n\n\nInvictus has been accused of crimes including domestic violence, stalking, and threats of bodily harm verbally and with a firearm, which have been reported to law enforcement in Florida at least ten times.\nThe first such allegation which gained public attention was reported in 2017 by his ex-fiancée. The ''Huffington Post'' reported that in July 2017, police in Orlando, Florida, \"recommended that charges of domestic battery by strangulation and aggravated battery be filed against Invictus.\" According to the article, charges were never filed due to both a lack of evidence and a lack of cooperation from the alleged victim. The victim stated to police that she hesitated as a result of feeling intimidated by Invictus's connections to white-supremacist organizations and legal expertise in addition to her allegations of serial acts of violence.\n\nInvictus was arrested in Melbourne, Florida, on January 1, 2020, on charges of \"kidnapping, 'high and aggravated' domestic violence and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence\". Upon his arrest in Melbourne, Invictus was then extradited to Rock Hill, South Carolina, where the alleged crimes, this time against another woman, who is his estranged wife, occurred. He requested a bail hearing which occurred on February 14, 2020, and his accuser made a statement to the court recounting her allegations. Her claims match as a pattern, the description of the acts Invictus's prior accuser had alleged he perpetrated. For example, his wife alleged he had abused her for 6 years via assaults including punching her in the stomach to avoid visible bruises, and locking her in the bedroom for days. Also as in prior allegations by the other victim, Invictus's wife independently reported to law enforcement that he had repeatedly strangled her, threatened her life with a firearm, and used the threat to use his extremist followers to silence her, claiming he would send them to target her and end her life if she escaped. On February 14, 2020, Judge Hall in , ordered that Invictus be held in jail without bond. On February 19, 2020, kidnapping charges were dismissed after the judge asserted that the charge lacked probable cause; however, the charges of \"high and aggravated\" domestic violence and possession of a firearm in commission of a crime of violence remain.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the court determined that Invictus could be freed on bail after his public defender cited the risk posed to inmates by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, less than three weeks after Invictus's release he was re-arrested in violation of the terms of his bond. Despite her restraining order, Invictus's wife reported that he made threatening and harassing contact with her over twenty times. He allegedly made an implied threat of violence at which point she agreed to meet him in a park with their children. At that time, Invictus allegedly spoke to their child referring to his accuser with derogatory slurs. On July 23, 2020, Invictus was denied a fourth request for bail by a judge in Rock Hill, South Carolina.\n\nStalking charges in Florida were dropped on August 4, 2020, after prosecutors determined the case was \"not suitable for prosecution\". On August 25, 2020, Invictus was granted release bail in York County, South Carolina.\n\nOn April 19, 2022, Invictus was found not guilty of all charges after the jury deliberated for 30 minutes. The alleged victim, Invictus's wife, did not attend the trial to testify. After his acquittal, Invictus publicly requested letters of apology from authorities responsible for his arrest and prosecution.\n\nIn 2023, Invictus was arrested and charged with crimes related to the 2017  in , . The trial began in February, 2024, with Invictus' attorney attempting to have the prosecutor's office recuse itself. Although Invictus is a lawyer, he has chosen not to  in court. In October 2024, a jury found him guilty of burning an object with the intent to intimidate, which is a felony in Virginia.\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He has eight known children by six women, only half of whom were contemporaneously acknowledged. Eastwood refuses to confirm his exact number of offspring, and there have been wide discrepancies in the media regarding the number. He is closed to discussing his families with the media, stating, \"they're vulnerable people. I can protect myself, but they can't.\"Rebecca Leung (January 27, 2004).  . . His biographer, , has stated on camera that Eastwood's total number of children is indeterminate and that \"one was when he was still in high school\".\n\nEastwood's first marriage was to manufacturing secretary-turned-fitness instructor Margaret Neville Johnson in December 1953, having met her on a  the previous May. During the courtship, he had an affair that resulted in his daughter Laurie (born 1954), who was  by Clyde and Helen Warren of Seattle. While the identity of Laurie's biological mother is not public record, McGilligan said the mother belonged to a theatre group Eastwood participated in. This notion is expressly denied by Patrick McGilligan, who insists Eastwood knew full well that he got a woman from Washington State pregnant andaccording to McGilligan's \"impeccable\" sourceshad told friends he suspected he might have a child there.}} Eastwood continued having affairs while married to Johnson, including a 1959 to 1973 liaison with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter, Kimber (born 1964)., p. 139 Tunis and Eastwood would keep up a \"healthy relationship\" until her death in 2023.\n\nJohnson tolerated the  with Eastwood, and eventually they had two children,  (born 1968) and  (born 1972). In 1975, Eastwood and married actress-director  began living together; she had been in a  since 1967 with Gordon Leigh Anderson, an unemployed homosexual. Locke claimed that Eastwood sang \"She Made Me Monogamous\" to her and confided he had \"never been in love before\". Eastwood finally divorced Johnson in 1984;, p. 348 Locke, however, would remain married to Anderson until her death in 2018. According to Bill Brown, publisher of the '''', Eastwood considered Locke the love of his life, yet he has never addressed her death.\n\nIn an unpublicized affair, Eastwood sired two legally fatherless, p. 252, p. 385 children,  (born 1986) and Kathryn (born 1988) with Jacelyn Reeves, a flight attendant. When Locke and Eastwood separated in 1989, Locke filed a  lawsuit and later sued for , reaching a settlement in both cases. During the early-to-mid-1990s, Eastwood had a relationship with actress  that produced a daughter,  (born 1993). Eastwood was married for the second time in 1996 to news anchor , who gave birth to their daughter Morgan that same year. Ruiz and Eastwood's marriage lasted until 2014.\n\nBeginning 2014, Eastwood was seen in company with restaurant hostess Christina Sandera, though neither publicly confirmed a romance. Eastwood's spokespeople, managers, and press agents have long denied any knowledge of his life. Sandera died of a heart attack in July 2024, aged 61. By the fall of that year, Eastwood was in a new relationship, though his partner has not been identified..\n\n\n\n\nEastwood has been a health and fitness fanatic since he was a teenager. During the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In an August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, take vitamins, and avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.\n\nEastwood's father's death from a  at the age of 64 in 1970, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on his life; from then on he became more productive, working with greater speed and efficiency on set, and adopted an even more rigorous health regimen. Despite abstaining from hard liquor, he opened an old English-inspired pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in  in 1971., p. 204 Eastwood eventually sold the pub in 1999 and now owns the , also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea., p. 108, 204\n\nEastwood is an avid golfer and owns the . He is an investor in the world-renowned  west of Carmel and donates his time to charitable causes at major tournaments. Eastwood is an FAA licensed fixed wing and rotary craft private pilot and often flies his helicopter to the studios to avoid traffic., p. 131\n\n\nIn 1973, Eastwood told the film critic , \"No, I \". In 2023, his daughter Kathryn stated, \"Most of my earthly family do not believe in or worship God. They either have a lack of faith or reject the god in the  in favor of other idols or ideas.\" Eastwood has said that he finds spirituality in nature (as suggested by his Western, ''Pale Rider'', 1985), stating that \"I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were , but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, 'I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that's something you like'. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way.\" He has also said: \"It would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you're supposed to do the best you can by the gift you're given of life and that alone.\"\n\nIn 1975, Eastwood publicly proclaimed his participation in  when he appeared on '''' with , the founder of Transcendental Meditation. He has meditated every morning for years.\n\n\nWhile serving in the US Army at nearby , Eastwood developed an interest in Carmel area real estate. With income from his acting career, on December 24, 1967, he bought five parcels totaling  of land from Charles Sawyer along  near Malpaso Creek, south of the .\n\nIn May 1968, Eastwood and actor  bought  of wooded land in Carmel Valley from the Howard Hattan estate for $640,000. The property was across the Carmel Valley Road from the Rancho Cañada Country Club and golf course. Eastwood and Garner donated the undeveloped property to the Housing Authority of the County of Monterey in November 1983 with the stipulation that some of the land be used for senior housing.\n\nHe named his production company Malpaso Productions. Eastwood later bought another parcel in the Highlands, together totaling  (6 parcels). In 1995, Monterey County bought the Malpaso land from him for $3.08 million and placed a permanent conservation easement on the property. Using the proceeds from the sale, Eastwood bought the  Odello Ranch at the mouth of the Carmel River during the same year. He paid to lower the levees along the southern side of the Carmel River to protect the Mission Ranch resort he owned, along with the neighboring Mission Fields residential neighborhood on the north side of the river, both of which were flooded in 1994. In 1997, Eastwood and his former wife Maggie Johnson (acting as the Eastwood Trust) donated  of the Odello Ranch property east of Highway 1 to the  along with the associated water rights.

He authored 12 books that in total have sold more than 2 million copies.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was inducted into the  on May 5, 1953. He went to the Southwestern Signal Corps Training Center at , California to study . On October 4, 1953, he was sent to  in the , where the 1954   tests were conducted.\n\nIn 1955, Browne was sent to  to finish his tour of duty and afterwards was transferred to the Army Reserves at , Arizona. He was released from active military service on July 17, 1956. He was honorably discharged from the armed forces on February 28, 1961, and discharged from the Army Reserves on July 1, 1961.\n\n\n\nBrowne worked as an advertising and sales executive in the 1960s. He then devoted himself full-time to the \"\" cause. He believed that the newspapers of America would willingly buy material promoting the American way of life; so, in 1961 he took on the proprietorship of American Way Features, Inc., a newspaper feature service, and as managing editor inaugurated a plan to turn the service from a subsidized program into a profit-making service. It sold \"Americanist\" features, in competition with all the recognized syndicates. His own column, The American Way, appeared in over 200 newspapers throughout America.\n\nIn the summer of 1962, Browne was named the advertising manager for the Liberty Amendment Committee's bimonthly ''American Progress for Economic Freedom''. In October he was named associate editor, and in November he was the editor. The following Spring the magazine was renamed ''Freedom Magazine'', and Browne continued as its editor until February 1964 when he turned his full-time attention to the American Way Features, Inc.\n\n\n\nAlso in the 1960s, Browne taught courses such as: The Economics of Freedom, The Tools of Success, Tools of the Market, The Economics of Success, and The Art of Profitable Living\". Browne was an investment advisor for much of his life and developed the so-called \"\" investment strategy, which claims to identify the four types of economic conditions that can apply over a given investment period, and the appropriate asset classes that give both profit from the upside of these conditions, and some measure of protection when they cease to prevail.\n\nBrowne published his first book, ''How You Can Profit From The Coming Devaluation'', in 1970. Browne's second book, ''How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World'', was published in 1973. ''You Can Profit from a Monetary Crisis'' was Browne's third book. He continued to write and publish books including his personal finance book, '''', published in 2001. According to Browne's web site, he was a consultant to the Permanent Portfolio Fund which utilizes some of the investment strategies described in his book, ''Fail-Safe Investing''. Browne also authored books and gave lectures on actively living a libertarian lifestyle.  His book ''How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World'' gave a detailed explanation of how one can bring libertarian concepts to every aspect of one's life.  His posthumously released 1960s lecture series, \"The Art of Profitable Living,\" was released as a 20-CD album titled, \"Rule Your World.\"\n\n\n\n in Arlington, Virginia.]]\nBrowne was the presidential nominee of the  in the s of  and .  He received 485,798 votes or 0.5% of the vote in 1996 and 384,516 votes or 0.4% of the vote in 2000.\n\nHis campaign qualified for  during each election but did not accept them, per his campaign platform. Browne's refusal to accept matching funds won him expected praise from libertarians and those who are against the concept of federal matching funds, but also earned him somewhat greater exposure in the \"mainstream\" media. Browne said he needed to be true to what he had preached in his libertarian speeches and that \"it would be highly inappropriate for me to stick my nose in the trough after having denounced the  and  for doing so.\" During both of these elections, the Libertarian Party was on the ballot in all fifty states and the . Browne did not appear on the 2000 Arizona ballot, however, as the Arizona Libertarian Party instead chose to run , whose candidacy was a protest against that of Browne.\n\nClaims of wrongdoing by  staffers during Browne's 1996 presidential campaign surfaced during his second run in 2000. Browne responded to allegations surrounding the controversy.\n\n\nAfter the 2000 election, Browne continued to work to increase the popularity of libertarian goals. In addition to writing and making appearances on behalf of the  (an organization he helped to co-found and for which he served as director of public policy for a year and a half), he hosted two weekly network radio shows, one on Saturdays dealing with politics, which he often called \"The Libertarian Conversation\" (since listeners were encouraged to call in), and the other on Sundays, called \"The Money Show\", dealing with financial topics. Both of these radio programs were on the . Browne also worked with the Free Market News Network, of which he was the president for much of 2005 and a senior political analyst. Via Free Market News, he had his own internet-based television show called ''This Week in Liberty'', which ran for 25 episodes.\n\nNear the end of his life, he worked on a book called ''The War Racket: The Lies, Myths, and Propaganda that Feed the American War Machine''. War, he contended, was just another government program, and was essentially flawed because \"government never solves anything.\" According to , \"As Harry explained to me, the book was unlike any other he had ever written. Harry was well-read in his history, but after starting on the project he realized that 'well-read' wasn't enough.\" According to Browne's wife, Pamela, he collected over 400 books, read almost all of them, and made copious notes.

He is a supporter of former US president  and a former believer and disseminator of the  conspiracy theory.\n\nChansley attended demonstrations in the  area starting around 2019 - in particular, in a march for climate. At rallies, he promoted conspiracy theories supporting Trump, and he has been a  at  events. His appearance, with  using the colors and symbols of the  and a headdress made of animal fur from a freshly killed raccoon helped to establish his  nicknames.\n\nAfter being photographed taking part in the January 6 storming of the Capitol, Chansley was arrested on January 9 on federal charges of \"Civil Disorder; Obstruction of an Official Proceeding; Entering and Remaining in a Restricted Building; Disorderly and Disruptive Conduct in a Restricted Building; Violent Entry and Disorderly Conduct in a Capitol Building; Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building.\" CHANSLEY, Jacob Anthony (aka Jacob Angeli)  United States Department of Justice |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/defendants/chansley-jacob-anthony |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=www.justice.gov |language=en}} He pleaded guilty to a single charge in September, and was sentenced to 41 months in prison followed by 36 months supervised release in November 2021.

After  and training as a supply clerk, he was assigned to the   in March 2006. At some point, he refused to take an  vaccine and was scheduled for discharge from the Navy.

He produced and narrated 11 videos espousing various conspiracy theories and uploaded them to the platform  in late 2020.\n\nChansley had a profile on the '''' website seeking work as an actor. In November 2023, he filed a candidate statement of interest to run as a  in the  for , but later failed to submit any petition signatures to get on the ballot.\n\n\n\nChansley was formerly a supporter of . He has a social media following and has attended rallies supporting , mostly in and around Phoenix. At various rallies in Arizona, he shouted about QAnon conspiracy theories and carried a sign that said \"Q Sent Me!\"\n\nChansley frequently protested alone outside the , espousing various conspiracy theories, in 2019. He was reported as a  when attending a  protest in Arizona and his ideology has been described as . In early 2020 he told '''' that he began wearing a fur hat and  to attract attention, so that he could then talk about QAnon and \"other truths\". He appeared at a  (BLM) protest in the Phoenix area in order to spread the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nFollowing the , Chansley's protests focused on challenging the results of the . He camped outside the  during the vote counting process, and gave a speech at a rally there on November 7, the day that  was declared president-elect, saying, \"This election has not been called! Don't believe that lie! They got their hands caught in the cookie jar and we're going to the ! Trump always looks like he's going to lose. And then he wins.\"\n\n\n\n\nDuring the , Chansley entered the  floor in the  wearing his \"shamanic\" attire, including a bison-horned fur  and war paint in red, white and blue, carrying a   with an  tied below the spear head. He was also photographed standing on the  in front of  's chair in the Senate chamber, gaining him significant media attention. He later said police had initially blocked the crowd from entry, but had then specifically allowed them entry, at which point he entered. On March 16, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. released previously unseen video footage of Chansley entering the Capitol building after windows were smashed. Several media outlets have noted that outfit resembled that of British acid jazz band ’s lead singer , which led to an official statement from Jay Kay denying that his involvement.\n\nVideo footage presented by  on  in March 2023 depicted Chansley walking through the Capitol building in the company of police officers who appeared to make no visible effort to stop him. Carlson, who was given exclusive access to the security footage by a top congressional Republican, characterized the officers as \"tour guides\" for Chansley and noted that none of the officers arrested him. U.S. Capitol Police Chief  denounced Carlson's segment, calling the show \"filled with offensive and misleading conclusions.\" Manger specifically took issue with Carlson's claim that Capitol Police officers acted as \"tour guides\" for Chansley. He maintained that Capitol Police officers were badly outnumbered and did their best to use de-escalation tactics to try to talk rioters into leaving the building. Chansley's attorney claimed to have no prior knowledge of the footage, noting that the government is obligated to disclose all evidenceespecially exculpatory evidenceand that here the government failed to do so. Because Chansley pleaded guilty, it remains unclear whether this error could cause court proceedings to be affected. The prosecution at the time he pleaded guilty had said they were still reviewing evidence.\n\nCourt transcripts reveal Chansley told the  that he had traveled to the Capitol \"as a part of a group effort, with other 'patriots' from Arizona, at the request of the President that all 'patriots' come to DC on January 6, 2021\". Prior to the Capitol being invaded, Chansley called out for the demonstrators to pause and join him in prayer, saying, \"Thank you for allowing the United States to be reborn. We love you and we thank you. In 's holy name, we pray.\" After the riot, Chansley told reporters, \"The fact that we had a bunch of our traitors in office hunker down, put on their s and retreat into their underground bunker, I consider that a win.\"\n\nChansley was listed as a  with the  on January 8. Interviewed while wanted, Chansley said that he believed he did nothing wrong, telling : \"I walked through an open door, dude,\" a claim later found to be untrue. Chansley told  that he \"wasn't worried\" about possible charges on January 8. Chansley had no  in Arizona before taking part in the riot.\n\n\nChansley was arrested and brought up on U.S. federal charges of \"knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds\", on January 9. A Capitol police special agent was quoted as saying that he identified Chansley by his \"unique attire and extensive tattoos covering his arms and left side of his torso\". Chansley voluntarily spoke to the Washington Field Office of the FBI prior to his arrest. In a January 14 court filing, federal prosecutors said that Chansley had left a note on Pence's desk in the Senate chamber that said \"It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"\n\nWhile jailed awaiting trial, Chansley refused to eat because the food served was not . Subsequently, a court ordered that he receive organic food.\n\nChansley was represented by  attorney Albert Watkins starting in January 2021 until his guilty plea on September 2. In a written statement, Watkins argued that Chansley had no part in the violence, did not hide his identity, was unarmed, not destructive, and followed the instructions of law enforcement officials in a respectful fashion; and that Chansley was carrying a  so his voice could be heard. He also presented evidence Chansley had been diagnosed with  while serving the Navy. He said in an interview with  in St. Louis, \"[Chansley] is responsible for his actions. He regrets where he is today\". Watkins publicly called on President Trump to pardon his client, arguing that Chansley had been unarmed, not violent or destructive, and had been acting on the \"invitation\" of the president. Later in January, Chansley made overtures for a presidential pardon from Trump through White House Chief of Staff . When the pardon was not granted, Watkins said, \"He [Chansley] regrets very very much having not just been duped by the President, but by being in a position where he allowed that duping to put him in a position to make decisions he should not have made.\" According to Watkins, Chansley was prepared to testify against Trump in . However, the trial ended with Trump's acquittal without any witnesses being called.\n\nFederal judge  ruled on March 8, 2021 that Chansley should not be released from jail, saying his lawyer's arguments were \"so frivolous as to insult the Court's intelligence.\" In a written statement, the judge said the \"defendant does not fully appreciate the severity of the allegations against him.\"\n\nChansley pleaded guilty to a single count of  on September 3, 2021, and agreed to accept the prosecution's recommended sentence of 41 to 51 months in prison as part of the settlement. Earlier, his lawyer said Chansley broke away from QAnon and asked that it no longer be used in terms for him. Judge Lamberth turned down a request for release (Chansley wanted to visit his grandfather while Watkins wanted to provide him with shelter and care for his mental health) on the grounds that there was no convincing evidence that there would not be any risk of escape.\n\nChansley was sentenced to 41 months in prison on November 17. He served his sentence at  in , with an original release date of May 25, 2024.

In November 2021, Chansley told the court, \"Men of honor admit when they're wrong. Not just publicly but to themselves. I was wrong for entering the Capitol. I have no excuse. No excuse whatsoever. The behavior is indefensible.\"\n\n\n\n\nAfter the storming of the Capitol, pro-Trump users on Facebook circulated false rumors that Chansley was not a Trump supporter and right-wing advocate but was instead associated with  and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and had infiltrated the event as an . Those false reports frequently included a photo of Chansley at a BLM rally in Arizona, cropping out his \"Q Sent Me\" sign that indicates he was a er rather than a participant at the rally.\n\nIn a January 6 tweet from his  account, @USAwolfpack, Chansley contradicted speculations made by Trump campaign lawyer : \"Mr. Wood. I am not antifa or blm. I'm a Qanon & digital soldier. My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX.\"  investigated the statement, concluding that he did attend a BLM rally, that he is not affiliated with antifa, and was an active Trump supporter.\n\nThere was also disinformation propagated which falsely claimed Chansley colluded with 's son-in-law, , seen in a photo with him outside the Capitol. Snopes wrote that Vos is a reporter with the Dutch  television channel , and the image is from a story on the protests which Vos wrote for the Dutch news program ''''.\n\n\n\nChansley has stated his unfounded belief that televisions and radios emit \"very specific frequencies that are inaudible,\" that \"affect the  of your brain\". He has also spoken about the  and said that , according to \"\" (that crisscross one another at sacred sites of civilizational importance, such as temples, pyramids, the buildings on the National Mall, amplify the , and which have been debunked by archaeologists and statisticians). During a 2020 interview on , Chansley declared that \"in order to beat this evil  force you need a light occultic force ... [you need] a force that is of the side of God, of love ... almost like on the side of the angels ... as opposed to the demons.\" In reflecting on the Capitol storming, Chansley said that \"What we did on January&nbsp;6 in many ways was an evolution in consciousness, because as we marched down the street along these ley lines shouting 'USA' or shouting things like 'freedom'... we were actually affecting the quantum realm.\"\n\nProsecutors have alleged that Chansley believes he is an  or higher being and is destined to ascend to another reality; he purports to be a  who remains on this plane of reality to lead other conscious beings to ascend this realm. When asked about her son in the wake of the January 2021 attack on the Capitol, his mother, Martha Chansley, said to , \"he's fine,\" adding that \"it takes a lot of courage to be a patriot\".\n\nIn an interview with journalist  after his release from prison, Chansley expressed great respect for , who, he insisted, had declassified three U.S. patents: “a zero-point-energy engine, infinite free clean energy; a room-temperature superconductor that allows a zero-point-energy engine to function without overheating; and what’s called a TR3Bit’s a triangular-shaped antigravity or inertia-propulsion craft. And when you combine all these things together, you get a whole new socioeconomic-geopolitical system.” He also described the Q poster of  as \"a successful psychological operation that disseminated the truth about corruption in our government.”\n\n\nAn animated Chansley appears in the 2021 \"\" episode of '''', in which he becomes a  tutor for \"Tutornon\". A character dressed in attire similar to Chansley's appears in a 2021 episode of '''' titled \"\", as well as a 2021 episode of ''''.

The council unanimously elected Hewitt Mayor on December 11, 2015, succeeding Joyce McIntire.\n\nIn 2018, Hewitt limited Calimesa's contract with the  (Cal Fire) to circumvent the state's  requirements. In its place, Calimesa established its own fire department that was free to offer  retirement plans to its employees in lieu of the s required by the Cal Fire union, which had accounted for a large portion of the . The change also allowed Calimesa to reduce its staffing levels on .

In September 2020, Hewitt introduced legislation to establish restrictions specific to Riverside County, which would've been looser than those set by the state. The legislation would've allowed some indoor services that had been ordered closed to reopen with capacity limits, including restaurants, gyms, hair salons, places of worship, movie theaters, libraries, and retailers. Hewitt's proposal would have reopened the County fully by November 3, with large events being permitted starting on October 13. Due to a threat by   to cut state funding to counties that did not follow his guidelines for reopening, Hewitt's plan had the potential to cost Riverside County between $28 million and $656 million in state funding. Hewitt argued that the additional tax revenue gained from reopening the County would offset any loss of state funds. On September 22, the Board of Supervisors voted 3–2 to advance Hewitt's proposal, but delayed its implementation to October. On October 6, the Board voted 4–1 to enact a modified version of Hewitt's plan, with Hewitt as the sole opposing vote. Hewitt says he voted against the final version because the specific deadlines in his original proposal had been removed, and language had been added directing the County to cooperate with the state on reopening guidelines.\n\nIn November 2020, a female county employee filed a lawsuit against the county which accused Hewitt of sexual harassment back in May 2020.

The United States has become replaced by a / society, the North American Confederacy, in this , also known to science fiction fans as the Gallatin Universe because of the pivotal role of  during the  in 1794. The antagonists of the series are styled , or sometimes \"Hamiltonians\", after the historical political party of  and . In 2004, a  version was released, illustrated by .\n* '''' (1980) takes place in outer space and discusses other settlements in the Gallatin Universe solar system. The Federalists are attempting to base a new civilization in interstellar space, kidnapping and enslaving a quarter of a million women as breeding stock from the anti-libertarian timeline from which the viewpoint character of ''The Probability Broach'' had escaped, with a plan to someday return in force to take over both of the alternate versions of Earth discovered by way of the P'wheet/Thorens probability broach.\n* '''' (1981) is a  of the  tales by , introducing the Lamviin, a trilaterally symmetrical race of aliens native to the arid planet of Sodde Lydfe.

The Federalists had created dozens of colonies, all of which had suffered disaster and retrogression under Federalist rule. Smith uses this device to criticize non-libertarian forms of government.\n* In '''' (1985), a time-traveling Federalist woman wants to change history but is opposed by the protagonists of ''The Probability Broach''. As these two forces clash, history is once again altered and yet another timeline is created.\n* '''' (2001), the final book in the series, is a direct sequel to ''The Probability Broach'' concerned with the refugees from various anti-libertarian versions of the United States who take up residence in the Confederacy, and the response of the Confederacy to terrorist violence.\n\n\nSmith wrote three novels set in the . All three feature con-artist, associate of  and previous owner of the '''', , first introduced in the film ''''. The novels take place between '''' and '':''\n\n* '''' (July 1983), the first novel in the series, follows Calrissian as he wins a droid, , in a sabacc game, but must travel to the Rafa system to claim it, where he is forced by Rokur Gepta into a quest for an ancient artifact.\n* '''' (October 1983), picks up with Calrissian and Vuffi Raa some time later, having started a freight business. Calrissian is invited to a high-stakes sabacc game in the Oseon system, where circumstances require him to assist in a drug sting, while defending against Rokur Gepta's revenge.\n* In '''' (December 1983), Calrissian and Vuffi Raa assist a persecuted alien race facing starvation instigated by the Centrality, and learn about Vuffi's origins.\n\nThe three novels were collected as '''' Omnibus Edition (1994).\n\n\n* ''Pallas'' was conceived as the first installment of a series that Smith called \"The Ngu Family Saga\". ''Pallas'' is the story of Emerson Ngu, a boy who lives in a n socialist commune in a crater on the  . Emerson secretly builds a crystal radio and is astonished to learn of the world outside the commune. Escaping, he discovers that the rest of Pallas is a libertarian utopia. Unable to forget his semi-enslaved familywhose \"workers' paradise\" is slowly starving to deathhe designs a cheap but durable gun (because the libertarians on Pallas, to their shame, did not have a domestic firearms industry), and sets about liberating his former commune. At the same time, he must learn the skills necessary for life in the outside world. The novel thus functions both as a  and a story of political revolution.\n* The writing of ''Ceres'', the second work in \"The Ngu Family Saga,\" was funded by private investors organized as Project Ceres by , a friend of Smith's. The plot centers on a figure skater from a small asteroid who is determined to compete successfully in the much heavier gravity of Earth, and her brother, pursuing mineral riches as an \"asteroid hunter\".\n* ''The Mitzvah'', a novel about a Catholic priest who is a pacifist and influenced by socialist values of the 1960s. His world is shattered when he learns that the German immigrant parents he grew up with have adopted him, and his true parents were a Jewish couple murdered in the .\n\n\nSmith joined the  in 1972 (just after its beginnings in 1971).

After failing to achieve even 1,500 signatures, his independent campaign quietly died. He next tried an abortive run for the Libertarian Party nomination, which ended almost as quickly when, in the California primary,  overwhelmingly defeated him, 71% to 9%.\n\nAlthough Browne was chosen by the party's 2000 national convention, Smith, because of  a dispute between the Libertarian Party's national organization and its Arizona affiliate, appeared as the Libertarian Party candidate for president on the  ballot. He and running mate Vin Suprynowicz received 5,775 votes in the national election, less than 0.01% of the vote.

Major contributions included $6300 from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry PAC, $5000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee, and $2500 from the Nebraska Realtors PAC.  Hardenburger raised over $76,000 and spent all but $450 of it.  Major contributions to his campaign included $25,000 from the Nebraska State Education Association PAC, $4000 from the Lincoln chapter of the , $3500 from the Associated General Contractors Highway Improvement PAC, $3000 from the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys PAC, and $3000 from the  PAC.  The Nebraska Bankers State PAC contributed $4000 to Ebke's campaign and $2200 to Hardenburger's.\n\nIn the general election, Ebke narrowly defeated Hardenburger, with 6102 votes, or 50.7% of the total, to Hardenburger's 5941 votes, or 49.3%.  Hardenburger won in Saline County, where Crete is located; but Ebke won in the other four counties that lay wholly or partly in the district.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2015 session of the Legislature, Ebke was named to the Business and Labor Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Urban Affairs Committee.\n\n\n\nFollowing the 2016 legislative session, governor  addressed a state Republican convention, criticizing several Republican state legislators for failing to support his position on various issues, and calling for the election of more \"platform Republicans\" to the legislature.  Ebke was one of thirteen legislators who signed a letter criticizing Ricketts for conduct that they described as placing partisanship ahead of principle.  Shortly thereafter, Ebke changed her registration from the Republican to the .  She was thought to be the first Libertarian member of the Nebraska legislature.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Al Riskowski, a registered Republican and the former director of the conservative organization  announced that he had secured Ricketts's endorsement in a bid for the 32nd District seat in 2018.\n\nIn the primary election, Riskowski came in third with 23 percent of the vote, Ebke won 33 percent, and farmer  won 44 percent.  Brandt and Ebke advanced to the general election.\n\nEbke lost her bid for re-election to Brandt, receiving 43.68% of the votes to Brandt's 56.32%, in the general election held on November 6, 2018.\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter joining the party earlier in the year, Laura Ebke was nominated on a presidential ticket in September 2024 by the  as their , with their  Trisha Butler also nominated as her running mate.

He was a  from 2013 to 2019; in June 2019, '''' reported that he became a , having previously been a  until September 2007 and an independent and then a  in the interim. He is the last non-Democrat to hold statewide and/or Congressional office in Rhode Island.\n\nThe son of Republican politician , who was the 66th Governor of Rhode Island, the , and a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Lincoln Chafee's first elected office was as a member of the Warwick City Council in 1985. After John Chafee died in 1999, Lincoln Chafee was appointed to fill his father's seat in the U.S. Senate to which he won .\n\nChafee was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against  in the lead-up to the . He was defeated in his  by Democrat . Chafee subsequently shifted his affiliation towards the Democratic Party by first endorsing  in the , running as an  for Governor of Rhode Island in , serving as the co-chair of Obama's , and then finally officially switching his registration to the Democratic Party in May 2013. In March 2019, he switched his political affiliation again to the .\n\nIn 2015, he sought nomination to become the Democratic Party  in the , but withdrew prior to the . In January 2020, Chafee filed to  for president, this time seeking the . Chafee withdrew his candidacy on April 5, 2020, and announced he would instead focus on helping \"other Libertarians seeking office.\"\n\n\n\nLincoln Davenport Chafee was born on March 26, 1953, in , the son of Virginia (née Coates) and . Chafee's great-great-grandfather  was . Among his great-great-uncles are Rhode Island Governor  and United States Senator . His great-uncle  was a  professor and a notable . The Chafee family was among the earliest settlers of , before moving south to Rhode Island.\n\nHe attended  in , , as well as later, . At , Chafee captained the  team, and in 1975 earned a Bachelor of Arts in . He then attended 's non-degree Farrier School (a sixteen-week ing program) in . For the next seven years, he worked as a  at  in the United States and Canada. One of the horses he shod, Overburden, set the track record at  in . In describing how his time as a farrier affected him, Chafee stated that \"when you're around horses, you tend to be a quieter person.\"\n\n\n\nChafee entered politics in 1985, when he was elected over eight other candidates to become delegate to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention. A year later, he was elected to the Warwick City Council, defeating an incumbent, and re-elected in 1988. He ran for Warwick Mayor in 1990, losing by 5 percent in a three-way race.\n\nIn 1992, he was elected Warwick's first Republican mayor in 32 years, and was re-elected in 1994, 1996, and 1998, when he won by 17% and carried all nine wards.\n\nChafee was praised for his fair-minded and sensible approach to government, including his ability to work with seven Democrats (of nine seats) on the Warwick City Council. He conservatively managed the city's finances, strengthening the city's bond rating and paying down the outstanding pension liability.\n\nHe worked effectively and cooperatively with the municipal unions, especially in settling a difficult and prolonged teacher labor dispute that he inherited from the previous administration.\n\nAs mayor, Chafee made conservation, environmental protection, and wise growth a priority. He purchased 130 acres of open space, planted hundreds of street trees, and created new historic districts and a new economic development \"intermodal\" district at the state airport. His municipal composting and recycling initiatives dramatically decreased landfill waste. His \"Greenwich Bay Initiative\", which extended sewer service to the most environmentally-sensitive areas of the city, earned Warwick recognition by EPA as one of the best local watershed programs in the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his father announced he would not seek re-election in 2000, Lincoln Chafee announced he would run for the seat. When John Chafee died suddenly in October 1999, Governor  appointed the younger Chafee to serve out the term.\n\nIn the general election he faced the  nominee, then- . Chafee won the election 57%–41%.\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2005, , the mayor of , announced his intention to run against Chafee in the Republican . Among other stances differing from those of Chafee, Mayor Laffey opposed abortion and . Laffey was supported by notable conservative groups, including the  and several anti-abortion groups. Chafee went on to defeat Laffey in the primary on September 12 by a margin of 53%–47%. The turnout for the Republican primary was the largest in Rhode Island history. In his victory speech, Chafee credited independent voters and disaffiliated Democrats for his victory.\n\nChafee lost to Whitehouse in the general election, 54%–46%. In response to a question at a news conference on November 9, 2006, Chafee stated he was unsure whether he would remain in the  after serving out the remainder of his term. According to Michelle R. Smith of the , when asked whether he felt that his loss may have helped the country by switching control of power in Congress (away from Republicans and toward the Democrats), he replied: \"To be honest, yes.\"\n\n\nDescended from a long line of moderate, center-right New England Republicans, Chafee's stances became increasingly liberal, more so than his father's positions had been. The now dominant  referred to him as a \"\", or RINO. Most notable among these was '''' magazine, which named Chafee \"the No. 1 RINO in the country.\" In 2006, the '''' rated Chafee as the most liberal Republican in the Senate, and placed him to the left of two Democrats, 's  and 's  (the only Republican ranked to the left of the latter senator).  also ranked Senator Chafee as the most liberal Republican member in 2006; according to GovTrack's analysis, Chafee was to the left of his Republican colleagues as well as to the left of fourteen Democrats.\n\nKnown for often disagreeing with the Republican Party leadership, Chafee says he did not cast his ballot for President  in the , instead choosing to  former president  as a nod to the Republican Party of his father. Chafee frequently criticized the younger Bush's record on the , and expressed concern about the 2004 Republican  and overall philosophical direction of the party. He described the younger Bush's presidency as \"an agenda of energizing the  , which is divisive.\" Soon thereafter, he rejected Democratic overtures to leave the Republican Party after appeals to him from other Republican  to remain in their caucus. Chafee considered challenging George W. Bush for re-nomination in the  in 2004 on an anti- (Iraq and Afghanistan) war platform. In his autobiography, ''Against the Tide'' (2007), he states that \"In the fall of 2003, part of me thought it was cowardly to oppose the president on so many issues and then not oppose him head-on as he sought renomination.\" However, he decided not to run after the capture of  on December 13, 2003.\n\n\nChafee also voted against both the 2001 and 2003 congressional budget bills that cut and/or rebated individuals' federal income taxes. He asserted that tax cuts reduce revenue to the federal government, thereby worsening the federal budget deficit and increasing the amount of money it has to borrow in order to operate. In 2004, Chafee broke with his party again to oppose the acceleration of the Bush tax cuts. \"Four Senate moderates --  of Arizona,  and , both of Maine, and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- had insisted on attaching a provision that would have applied pay-as-you-go-rules for the next five years.\"\n\nOn November 17, 2005, he voted in favor of reinstating the top  rate of 39.6% (which last existed under President  in the 1990s) on the highest-income taxpayers.\n\nIn 2003, Chafee voted against the   expansion. However, Chafee also cast a crucial procedural vote against a Democratic attempt to kill that bill, which failed by only two votes. Chafee also co-sponsored the , which expanded federal jurisdiction over class-action lawsuits, and voted against a wholesale ban on gifts from employees of lobbying companies.\n\nThe 's Center for Trade Policy Studies identified Chafee as a \"free trader\" during his U.S. Senate tenure, indicating a pro-, pro-, and anti- voting record. Chafee has supported  agreements (e.g.,  and  (CAFTA) and .\n\nAs U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2000, C− in 2001, C in 2002, C− in 2003 and 2004, and D in 2005 and 2006 from the , a  .\n\n\n\nChafee was one of the few Republicans to vote against allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and was a member of the Republicans for Environmental Protection. He has been endorsed throughout his career by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservative Voters as a strong leader for environmental causes, despite criticisms from other progressive activist groups decrying the endorsement of a (then) Republican.\n\nChafee sponsored the  of 2002, enabling the clean up and redevelopment of thousands of abandoned urban buildings throughout the United States.\n\n\nChafee was a member of the  and . Chafee was also a member of the .\n\nChafee is . In 2003, Chafee was one of the three Republican Senators to oppose the . His 2006 senatorial re-election bid was endorsed by . He also supported federal funding for  research.\n\nIn 2004, Chafee was one of six Republicans to vote against the , an amendment intended to ban gay marriage; in 2006, he voted against banning gay marriage a second time. During his tenure, Chafee was the only sitting or former Republican senator to support the legalization of , until  of  endorsed it in 2013.\n\nHe supported  and , and was one of only two Republicans to vote against the  (which prevents  manufacturers and  from being held liable for crimes committed with their products). On June 27, 2006, Chafee was one of only three Republicans to vote against the proposed .\n\nChafee opposes the , and has consistently voted against limiting death penalty appeals in federal cases. He has also favored including  in death penalty appeals, and making  a prerequisite for any federal-level, criminal executions.\n\nOn May 23, 2005, Chafee was one of  to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial , forestalling the Republican leadership's implementation of the so-called \"\". Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush II judicial nominee only in an \"extraordinary circumstance\", and three of the most conservative Bush  nominees (,  and ) would receive a vote by the full Senate. Chafee was the only Republican to oppose George W. Bush's nomination of  to the . However, he voted to end debate on the nomination, helping to end any chance of a Democratic filibuster of it. Chafee did not announce his opposition to the nomination until a majority of Senators had already publicly said they would support Alito.\n\n\nChafee was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against authorization of  in the lead-up to the . On June 22, 2006, he was the only Republican to vote for the Levin amendment calling for a nonbinding timetable for a withdrawal of  from . Chafee voted against the  calling for a binding timetable.\n\nChafee is now involved in , a liberal Jewish group that calls for Israel to withdraw from all occupied territories and advocates for a \"two state\" solution to the .\n\nIn November 2006, immediately following the midterm elections, Chafee joined key Democrats in opposing President Bush's renomination of  as . On December 4, 2006, the White House announced that Bolton would no longer seek the appointment, and would resign within a matter of weeks.\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\nIn December 2006, Chafee announced he was accepting a fellowship to serve as a \"distinguished visiting fellow\" at Brown University's Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies. The university had Chafee lead a student group studying U.S. foreign policy.\n\nIn September 2007, Chafee officially left the Republican Party, changing his affiliation to Independent. He said that he did so because of the Republican Party's drifting away from its core values, such as its abandoning fiscal conservatism. Citing the party's new tendency to pass tax cuts without spending cuts to balance the loss of revenue, he noted how the party was destroying social programs aimed to help middle-class and lower-income Americans, particularly s and . In February 2008, he said he was considering voting for then-Senator  in Rhode Island's  presidential primary election. On February 14, 2008, with the Rhode Island Democratic primary approaching in three weeks, Chafee officially endorsed Obama. In 2012, he was one of 35 co-chairs selected to \"act as key surrogates and ambassadors\" for Obama's re-election campaign.\n\nIn 2008, Chafee joined the advisory board of , a lobbying group that promotes diplomatic relations between Israel and its neighbors, and supports an independent .\n\nIn September 2008, Chafee received media attention for describing , then- and the Republican vice-presidential nominee in the , as a \"cocky wacko.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn January 4, 2010, Chafee formally declared his intention to run for Governor of Rhode Island in 2010 as an independent, as the incumbent Governor  (a Republican re-elected the same day Chafee lost his Senate re-election bid) was  at the time. On October 31, 2010, electoral analysis site  gave Chafee a 63.8% chance of victory, compared to Democratic opponent 's 26.2% and Republican opponent 's 10.0%. Likewise, other sites, such as the , classified the race as a \"toss-up\". Chafee's approval rating at the time of his 2006 defeat was between 51% and 63%.\n\nOn September 16, 2010, New York City Mayor  (who had also switched from Republican to Independent to Democratic in recent years) traveled to Rhode Island. Bloomberg praised Chafee's \"experience and integrity\", saying that Chafee would put Rhode Islanders' interests \"ahead of party interests\", and that Chafee would \"produce results - because that's exactly what he did as a mayor and as senator.\"\n\nIt was reported that President Obama's lack of endorsement of any of the candidates indicated tacit support of Chafee over Democrat Caprio.\n\nChafee easily won the endorsements of all major public school teachers unions, including the Rhode Island affiliates of the  and  in his 2010 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Chafee won the gubernatorial race, winning with a 36% plurality in the seven-candidate race.\n\n\nIn August 2012, he announced plans to attend the  in , to show support for President 's re-election campaign. After constant speculation during his term, Chafee officially joined the  on May 30, 2013. He had previously indicated that he might run for re-election as an Independent or a Democrat.\n\n\nChafee came to office in the depths of the worst recession in decades. Unemployment peaked at 11.4% in the first months of his tenure. Over his four budgets, July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2015, the rate dropped to 5.9%, second best in the country.\n\nChafee also inherited a crisis with impending bankruptcies of a number of municipalities including Providence, East Providence, Pawtucket, West Warwick and Woonsocket.\n\nAs a former mayor, Chafee was a strong advocate for the state's city and towns. He increased state aid and intervened to protect these distressed communities.\n\nOne city, Central Falls, did declare a bankruptcy. Chafee appointed a special master to run the city on an interim basis, negotiate concessions with labor and retirees, and pass a budget with tax increases. Central Falls emerged from bankruptcy the following year.\n\n\nChafee had campaigned on a platform that included lowering the state sales tax by creating a 1% tax on 59 tax exempt commodities and services. This would have squarely addressed the Rhode Island legislature annual budget deficit.\n\nA 2012 poll showed that some of Chafee's proposed tax increases, intended to move the state from budget deficit to surplus status, had received negative feedback from Rhode Island residents.  As Governor of Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2012 and B in 2014 from the , a  think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.\n\nIn two of his four budgets, there were no tax increases. At the same time, he restored 20% to local education and higher education, cut by his predecessor.\n\n\nIn May 2012, Chafee refused on principle to release a prisoner charged with murder to federal custody because Rhode Island hadn't had an execution since 1842 and the US Attorney refused to guarantee the prisoner, if convicted would receive a maximum life imprisonment without parole. Chafee said: \"The State of Rhode Island must seek to protect both the strong  issues at stake, and the legitimacy of its longstanding public policy against the death penalty.\"\n\nChafee championed a bill that legalized , signing it into law on May 2, 2013.\n\nChafee has shown some willingness to deviate from strict \"\" policies, in favor of alternative approaches to America's drug-crime problem.\n\n\nOn \"education reform\" in general, Chafee does not believe the politically and publicly popular presumption that America's schools are failing, saying:\n\nThis notion of all these failing schools, if this were true, how did America get to be at the status where we are in the world if it were that bad? So I don't buy into the trashing of our public school system. Somehow , and  and ,  are full of public school students that are doing very, very well and leading America in many fields. Yes, there's room for improvement, I don't deny that and I want to be part of the improvement. But the notion that our public school systems are in disarray and failing, I don't buy that.\n\n\nChafee was the only public figure in Rhode Island to vigorously oppose an ill-fated deal in which the previous governor committed an unsecured $75 million loan to a former baseball star, , to develop a new video game, ''''. The first payments started two months before he took office in January 2011.\n\nThe game was released in February 2012 to moderate critical success, but failed commercially. 38 Studios ended up laying off their staff and filed for bankruptcy. According to Schilling, Chafee's public comments calling the game a \"failure\" caused a publisher to pull out of a $35 million deal that could have paid for a sequel. In response, Chafee said he would need to \"verify\" Schilling's claim, saying that he couldn't \"just take it as a leap of faith.\" He added that it \"isn't accurate\" to blame the state for the company's collapse.\n\nAs chair of the agency securing the loan, Chafee initiated a lawsuit to recover lost funds for Rhode Island taxpayers. To date, about $17 million has been recovered through settlements.\n\n\n\nIn 2011,  and local conservatives and pundits stirred up controversy over the Christmas tree at the Rhode Island State House. Governor Chafee said he called the towering fir, decorated with lights, tinsel and toys, a \"holiday tree,\" because that had been the accepted practice of the two previous governors, both Republicans.  Chafee went on national TV with commentator , calling Fox News' \"war on Christmas\" coverage \"angry.\"\n\n\n\nChafee had previously indicated that he might run for re-election as an Independent or a Democrat. With polling showing him trailing in the Democratic primary, Chafee announced on September 4, 2013, that he would not run for re-election. Chafee thus became just the fourth governor in the history of Rhode Island to decline to seek a second term, and the first since  in 1924.\n\n\n\nOn April 9, 2015, Chafee announced that he had formed an  in preparation for a potential candidacy for President of the United States as a Democrat in 2016. He formally declared candidacy on June 3, 2015, with the campaign focused on  with \"Prosperity Through Peace\" being his slogan.\n\nFollowing a widely panned debate performance and poor polling numbers, Chafee announced on October 23, 2015, that he would be ending his campaign. After she secured the Democratic nomination, a Chafee spokesman said that he would support .\n\n\nChafee considered challenging Sheldon Whitehouse for his former Senate seat , but ultimately decided against doing so.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, Chafee and his family moved their residency to Wyoming. By 2018, Chaffee's wife Stefanie had registered as a voter in . Chafee completed his move to Wyoming in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, Chafee joined the Libertarians for the National Popular Vote advisory board.\n\nChafee has endorsed  in the . Kennedy initially ran as a Democrat and later withdrew before the Democratic primaries began to run as an Independent.\n\n\n\n}}\n\nIn February 2017, Chafee had made it known that he was not ruling out another run for the presidency.\n\nOn March 11, 2019, Chafee officially switched from the Democratic to the , stating, \"It's what I've always beenfiscally conservative and socially liberal.\" In August, Chafee declared that he'd \"be open\" to running for president as a Libertarian.\n\nOn January 5, 2020, Chafee formally filed to run for the . He formally announced his candidacy on January 8 at the  in Washington, D.C.\n\nChafee's 2020 platform highlighted issues such as foreign intervention, the war on drugs, and government spending. While individuals such as former New York gubernatorial candidate  and national party chair  were supportive of Chafee, others including the  state chair  were more skeptical due to his historical positions on , among other things. According to '''', Chafee hired Libertarian consultant Christopher Thrasher as  and selected  Town Council member Caswell Cooke Jr. for the position of campaign treasurer.\n\nOn April 5, 2020, Chafee announced on Facebook that he was ending his campaign for the Libertarian presidential nomination. He did not make any endorsements for president.\n\n\nWhile serving in the U.S. Senate, Chafee was characterized as a \"\" or even \".\" The non-partisan '''' in 2005 gave him a composite 59% liberal score and a 41% conservative score. His record as a more liberal Republican Senator earned him criticism from conservatives; the conservative magazine, '''', labeled him one of the top ten , or what they consider to be insufficiently conservative, in 2005.

In March 2000, Madsen was elected as the first resident president of the North Ranch Homeowners Association. He and Erin have five children.\n\nMadsen nearly died in 2007, when he accidentally overdosed on prescription pain medication. His doctor prescribed him a fentanyl patch for back pain. The patch burst, sending the medication right into his bloodstream. His kids found him on the couch. He was cold and not breathing. His family revived him with the help of 911.

The proposition was a  to legalize   which was approved by voters in 1996. Kubby was known as a  patient who relied on medical cannabis.\n\nKubby authored two books on drug policy reform: ''The Politics of Consciousness'' (1995) and ''Why Marijuana Should Be Legal'' (2003). He was the  candidate for  in , receiving 0.9% of the vote. In 2008, he declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's  and received significant support for the nomination, but was eliminated after the second ballot.\n\nKubby died in  on November 20, 2022, aged 75.\n\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 23, Kubby began experiencing symptoms of  and . He was diagnosed with malignant , a rare, fatal form of adrenal cancer.  Kubby underwent surgery to remove a tumor in 1968, 1975 and 1976. This last time, his medical records show that the cancer had metastasised to his liver and beyond. All other patients with this diagnosis have had a 100% mortality rate within five years.   His physician, Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, a specialist from the , monitored his condition and treated him with conventional therapies, including , until referring him to the  in 1981 for yet another surgery and .\n\nFor the next 25 years, Kubby maintained that he was able to control the symptoms of his disease solely by smoking marijuana and by maintaining a healthy diet. His original doctor, an expert on this condition shocked to learn he was still alive, said,  \"In some amazing fashion, this medication has not only controlled the symptoms of the , but in my view, has arrested its growth.\"\n\n\nIn the , Kubby was the Libertarian candidate for , receiving 0.9% of the vote. The same year, he became national director of the . Two months after the election, Kubby's home was raided by the  sheriffs department. The officers seized 265 marijuana plants and a small quantity of  from a guest bedroom, and Kubby was arrested.\n\nKubby was a contender to be the Libertarian Party's vice presidential candidate in the . The Libertarian Party requires the vice presidential candidate to be nominated by the delegates just as the presidential candidate is selected. Kubby was opposed by fellow Californian , and by  of Pennsylvania. After no candidate received a majority on the first ballot, Krawchuk withdrew his name from the ballot and endorsed Olivier, who then defeated Kubby by a vote of 418 to 338.\n\nOn August 20, 2006, at the , Kubby announced his intention to seek the Libertarian Party's nomination for . The Federal Election Committee (FEC) issued candidate ID numbers for Kubby personally and for the Kubby for President Committee on September 18, 2006. He had since campaigned at various community and Libertarian Party events and launched a campaign web site. He later endorsed  for president, in the event that Ron Paul is able to secure the GOP nomination. Meanwhile, Kubby was continuing to actively campaign and has made Internet history with the first animated presidential campaign video. On May 25, 2008, Kubby did not gain his party's nomination and was eliminated after the second ballot at his party's national convention.\n\n\nCannabis Sativa, Inc. announced on June 30, 2014, that Kubby was named chairman of the company. This was following Cannabis Sativa's acquisition of Kush Inc., previously owned by Kubby and the owner of the first patented marijuana plant.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, Kubby was instrumental in the drafting and passage of California , ''The Compassionate Use Act of 1996''.   Despite the victory of Prop. 215, Kubby and his wife, Michele, were arrested, jailed and prosecuted, under the false claim that the voter initiative provides only an  and that it is to be used by only \"seriously ill patients.\"\n\nIn the 1996 Voter's Handbook, the Official Title and Summary prepared by the Attorney General Dan Lungren, the State of California informed voters that a 'YES' vote on Prop. 215 would exempt patients and defined caregivers from criminal laws. In fact, the very first sentence of the official title and summary clearly states: \"Exempts patients and defined caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician from criminal laws which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of marijuana.\"\n\nNowhere in the official Title and Summary does it say anything about an affirmative defense, or any limits or restrictions.\n\nFurthermore, in the official Analysis of Proposition 215 by the Legislative Analyst, the voters were told, \"No prescriptions or other record-keeping is required by the measure.\" In addition, the voters were reminded by the Legislative Analyst that this initiative also covered any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.\"\n\nThe  Sheriff's Department had been sent an anonymous letter alleging that the Kubby's had been operating a major grow operation from their residence, and began an investigation. Kubby learned of this, and invited them to inspect the grow room, by passing a note through his own household trash, which the police had begun searching. That note, \" ... addressed to law-enforcement personnel, advising them of Steve Kubby's use of medicinal marijuana, maintenance of a garden, possession of no more than 3.5 pounds of pot and his cancer condition,\" was removed from his trash and entered as evidence by the prosecution.\n\nIn 1999, Kubby and his wife Michele were arrested and faced trial for growing his own cannabis in his home, though he was entitled to do so legally on behalf of himself and his wife, also a licensed cannabis patient. Calling his arrest the \"Scopes monkey trial of medical marijuana,\" Kubby remained defiant in his support of the Compassionate Use Act. He maintains that the prosecution was politically motivated, implicating then-Attorney General 's office. Lungren had been aggressive in resisting the implementation of Proposition 215, to the point of issuing instructions to s on how to cross-examine cannabis patients so as to undermine their claim of sanction.\n\nIn jail for 72 hours after the arrest, Kubby was deprived of medical marijuana and became seriously ill. His blood pressure shot up to dangerous levels. USC Medical Center's Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, who made Kubby's original diagnosis, wrote a letter to the court explaining Steve's condition and warning the judge what could happen if Steve was further deprived of cannabis.\n\n\n\nKubby described their ordeal in his official complaint,\n\n}}\n\nMichele Kubby won an acquittal on all charges. Steve Kubby's trial, owing to one juror's refusal to acquit, received a mistrial on all the cannabis charges, which were eventually dropped. The jury also voted to convict on a possession charge involving a psilocybin mushroom stem and a few peyote buttons (a felony) found in their house.  Kubby was sentenced to 120 days in jail.\n\n\nIn 2001, exercising his right to appeal the conviction for peyote possession, Kubby obtained the court's permission to move to  with his wife and two children. Kubby and his advisors were concerned that police and prosecutors were determined to prove their theory that he did not really need medical marijuana and would find a way to arrest and incarcerate him.  After the Kubby family had been in Canada for a few months Kubby alleged the terms of his appeal were changed without his knowledge or consent by two judges. Kubby claimed that he was wrongly reclassified as a fugitive.\n\nKubby appealed his fugitive status through the Canadian legal system for five years. Among the arguments made in fighting the appeal was the likelihood that he would be denied access to cannabis in custody and risk death from his illness. This fear was later proved to be well founded as confirmed by the Placer Jail medical staff who found blood in his urine and other evidence of severe hypertensive trauma, which Kubby still suffered from.\n\nDr. Joseph Michael Connors, an expert in the area of adrenal cancers, testified at the Canadian extradition hearing about Kubby's medical condition:\n\n}}\n\n\n\nAfter numerous appeals, Kubby was asked to leave Canada under a \"conditional Departure Order\" within 30 days, which he did. He arrived in , , on Thursday, January 26, 2006, accompanied by his attorney Bill McPike, and was immediately arrested. Although it had been arranged that Kubby would surrender at the Placer Superior Court on Tuesday, 31 January, he was removed from the Alaska Airlines jet on arrival by San Francisco police officers at the request of sheriff's officials in Placer County and taken through secure areas of the airport, bypassing the supporters gathered to greet him.\n\nHe was held in  Jail in , where, according to  spokesman Dale Gieringer, he was becoming rapidly ill. He was transported to  Jail Friday afternoon and was arraigned at 1 p.m. in Dept. 13 of Placer County Superior court Tuesday, 31 January. Gieringer reports that Placer County Jail granted Kubby access to , a  synthetic which lacks the  which have been shown to modulate  levels.  Kubby, with the Marinol, immediately went into cardiac arrest due to the lack of subsequent cannabinoids which modulated the known issues. Michele Kubby reported that the Marinol helped in specific quantities, but that her husband could tell subjectively that it will not be effective in the long run.\n\n\n\nShe also describes her husband's conditions of confinement,\n\n\n\nIn January, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting Kubby and calling for his immediate release from jail. On March 6, 2006, Kubby was released early from jail for good behavior. At a March 14 hearing, he was re-sentenced to another 60 days in jail for violating his probation by not returning from Canada in 2001, and began serving the sentence on Wednesday, March 15. Kubby was released on April 5 after serving only 22 days of the 60-day sentence, his time reduced because of jail overcrowding.\n\nIn July 2007, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCPthe drug czar's office) used testimony submitted to Congress to misrepresent the position of Kubby, claiming that he no longer supports medical marijuana.\n\nIn written testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, Dr. David Murray, ONDCP's Chief Scientist called medical marijuana advocates \"modern-day snake oil proponents,\" sneered at medicines that make patients \"feel good,\" and claimed that laws okaying medical marijuana in a dozen states have led to \"abuse, confusion, and crime.\" Then, to further buttress his argument against the therapeutic use of the herb, he added:\n\n\n\nKubby suffered from almost constant nausea while on Marinol, he wrote, adding that Murray took his sentence about Marinol out of context. The paragraph from which it was extracted reads as follows: \"During that time I experienced excruciating pain, a vicious high blood-pressure crisis, passed blood in my urine and I lost 33 pounds. However, there was also good news. I learned that Marinol is an acceptable, if not ideal, substitute for whole cannabis in treating my otherwise fatal disease. Now I am a free man and I am profoundly grateful to be alive and to have friends and supporters such as you.\"\n\nWhile conceding that Marinol can be effective for treatment of hypertension and would allow him to travel briefly without medical marijuana, it does not allow him to have an acceptable quality of life, Kubby said.\n\n\"Please help me squash this deceptive and dangerous misrepresentation of my true feeling on this matter by the ONDCP,\" Kubby wrote. \"It just shows how desperate they are that they must mislead people in this way. And just so there is no question about this, let me be clear: Whole cannabis is not only the best medicine for me, it is the only medicine that has kept me alive during the 32 years that I have continued to live, in relatively good health, despite a terminal diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma.\"\n\n\nKubby was a strong supporter of  the  and . He advocated for legal , , , a  foreign policy, immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from the , , and the elimination of federal individual . He was opposed to most governmental regulations, programs, and federal . He also opposed the ,  and the .\n\nDuring a 2009 interview with a  newspaper, he criticized the health care plan presented by President , saying: \"Obama is ready to spend trillions of dollars to create a government health program. I have a far simpler plan that will genuinely help patients and save them and the government all those trillions of dollars: reschedule marijuana to reflect reality and authorize its use for medical purposes.\"\n\n\n\n* \n* ''''\n* \n* \n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n*  at \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

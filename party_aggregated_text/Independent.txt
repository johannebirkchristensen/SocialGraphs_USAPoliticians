Her father was a strict authoritarian whom she feared. This fear kept them from being close and was also the reason for her brother, nine years her senior, would leave home early to join the Air Force. Her church community was a big influence on her, with many of the women, including her grandmothers, serving as role models. Her grandma Randolph was a founder in both the Oregon's Association of Colored Women's Clubs and Portland's Harriet Tubman Club. She graduated from Girls Polytechnic High School in 1965 (which later became James Monroe High School). She was the first woman in her family to graduate from high school. Prior to her high school graduation, Avel and her boyfriend (at the time) Neshell, became pregnant. The two married and then soon after he was drafted for the war in Vietnam. The marriage did not last after his return, but the two kept a good relationship for their son. After Avel and Neshell's separation she started to become interested in attending college, partly from visits to see her younger sister in Eugene who was attending the University of Oregon. After five years at , she enrolled at , earning a degree in the administration of justice. Though an avid reader, it was not until her time at Portland State University that she was first exposed to African American literature and noted how she had not been exposed to this during her time in the public school system. During her time at PSU she also applied to participate with  and was accepted, sending her to West Africa with most of her time spent in a small village in Nigeria, all of which would go on to be a life-changing experience. In 1974, she became the first person in her family to graduate from college. After graduating, Gordly began working with the State of Oregon Corrections Division as a counselor in a work release facility for women where she noticed racial bias that led to work release for black women and education release for white women.\n\n\nGordly was appointed to the  in 1991, to replace Ron Cease, and later elected to the seat, ultimately serving three terms, representing parts of  and .

Walsh assumed office on January 1, 2018 as the first  mayor of Syracuse and the second without major party support since  in 1913.\n\n\nWalsh is the son of former congressman  and grandson of former congressman and mayor of Syracuse, New York, , both of whom represented Central New York as .\n\nWalsh grew up as one of three children in the  neighborhood. He graduated from Westhill High School in 1997. Walsh attended  and graduated with a B.A. in Political Science. He also received a Master’s degree in Public Administration from the  at  in 2005.\n\n\nWalsh began his policy career working for Laborers Local 633, working on construction jobs around Onondaga Lake after his graduation from Ithaca College. Following this, he worked for the political actions staff of the  in . In 2002, Walsh returned to Syracuse to run his father's congressional campaign. Following his father’s campaign, Walsh traveled to Ireland, where he stayed for three months and interned for then  .\n\nWalsh eventually returned to Syracuse to work for , educating municipalities about . He went on to become the deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Neighborhood and Business Development under previous mayor . Here, Walsh created the Greater Syracuse Land Bank and was part of the redevelopment of . He also worked on the Metropolitan Development Association, a precursor to CenterState CEO. Additionally, Walsh served on several boards and community groups around Syracuse, including serving as president of the Gifford Foundation board.\n\nAfter resigning from his position at city hall in 2015, Walsh worked for Mackenzie Hughes law firm as Business Development Director, prior to launching his campaign to become the mayor of Syracuse.\n\n\nWalsh was elected mayor of Syracuse in 2017 while running on two minor party lines, the  and . In what was generally seen as an upset, Ben Walsh won the election with 53.2% against four other candidates, namely Democratic frontrunner Juanita Perez Williams as well as the nominees from the Republican, , and .\n\n\nIn January 2019, Walsh introduced his major policy plan, Syracuse Surge, at that year's State of the City. The goal of the plan was to modernize Syracuse’s economy and prepare it for equitable access to new technology (as anticipated in projections in the ) through both public and private investment.\n\nThe mayor's plans have included establishing a  (STEAM) school at the old  and was expected to open in Fall 2022.\n\nIn January 2020, Walsh announced the Resurgent Neighborhood Initiative (RNI), a plan for housing and economic development focused on ten neighborhoods and business corridors throughout Syracuse. The RNI plan was expected to add 200 new units of affordable housing to the city. Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, the program's progress has continued.\n\n\nMayor Walsh made an executive order regarding police reform. The executive order included the enactment of the Right to Know law which requires officers to give their name, rank and reason for stopping someone during every interaction with the public. The officers are required to leave their information if no arrest is made. Additionally, the executive order includes equipping each patrol car with a dashboard camera, securing more body-worn cameras for patrol officers and new training guidelines such as education on the history of racism in Syracuse and the United States, among other things.\n\n\nMayor Ben Walsh’s administration created The Mayor's Office to Reduce Gun Violence, tasked with conducting a Syracuse Violent Crime Assessment and recommending interventions for its Community Violence Intervention Plan.\n\n\nOn April 1, 2022, Mayor Ben Walsh’s administration appointed Lateef Johnson-Kinsey, a pastor at The Well of Hope Church, as director of The Mayor's Office to Reduce Gun Violence. Johnson-Kinsey is the executive director of Transforming Lives & Community and was previously the Dean of Students at Syracuse Academy of Science.\n\n\nOn March 7, 2023, Mayor Ben Walsh’s administration announced The Safer Streets Program, a $1 million proposal from The Mayor's Office to Reduce Gun Violence and Lateef Johnson-Kinsey recommending paying known gang members a weekly $100-$200 stipend not to commit violent crime and to attend training, therapy and career coaching. The program uses federal funds from the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan.\n\nJohnson-Kinsey claimed that his office found that the gangs are not fighting over drugs or money but over feuds and personal disputes.\n\n\nThe Safer Streets Program proposes stipends to alleviate poverty for 50 of the city’s most at-risk individuals between the ages of 18 and 24, many of whom have criminal records and gang affiliations. The payments are designed to help gang members with basic expenses and are available if they avoid violent criminal behavior and participate in other program initiatives.\n\nThis was met with pushback from the Syracuse Police Benevolent Association and opinion pieces by local politicians.\n\nSyracuse Police Benevolent Association President Joseph Moran said, “You’re actually paying stipends to individuals who are documented gang members to maintain good behavior and obey the law. It really was a surprise to us to see that. I know it doesn’t sit well with the membership. It really doesn’t sit well with myself.”\n\nIn a Post-Standard letter to the editor, 2nd District City Councilor and Democrat Pat Hogan wrote the following: \"There is no doubt that the city of Syracuse… has a gang problem that leads to acquisition of illegal guns by gang members and indiscriminate gunfire in our city neighborhoods that results in injury and death to gang members and, tragically and way too often, the innocent… We need to aggressively use every means at our disposal to stop this violence. Paying gang members is not the answer… I will never support paying stipends to gang members who are still engaged in criminal activity.\"\n\n\nThe city of Syracuse was awarded a $500,000 grant in the beginning of 2019 by the  to buy and replace all of the city’s streetlights with energy-efficient lightbulbs. The Walsh Administration claimed the purchase was estimated to save the city $3 million per year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6,100 tons.\n\nOn April 18, 2019,  selected Syracuse as one of five winners of its inaugural Advancing Cities Challenge; the City of Syracuse was awarded $3 million. This money is for improving tech sector jobs and not-for-profit organizations in low- or middle-income neighborhoods with the overall goal of training young people, veterans, and people of color for future careers.\n\nIn April 2021,  donated $1.75 million to the STEAM school at Central Tech in order to further increase access to tech education in the city.\n\n\nBen Walsh worked with InterFaith Works, a local charity, to lead community discussions on  in 2018 and 2019. In 2020, he established a formal advisory council, the Columbus Circle Action Group, to consider ways to modify Columbus Circle. That group put forth a number of ideas, but in its report stopped short of suggesting that the statue should be removed. Nonetheless, on October 9, 2020, Walsh announced he had decided to remove the statue and other parts of the statuary from the monument and send the statue of Columbus to an unidentified “private location.”  \n\nIn response, the Columbus Monument Corporation and 27 Syracuse taxpayers sued the City and Mayor on May 16, 2021, to stop the plan. The petitioners argued that the monument was privately funded and that private funds were integral to the monument's renovation by the City in 1992, and that Walsh lacked the legal authority under city law and a 1990s contract with the state to remove the monument or any part of it. On March 11, 2022, Supreme Court Justice Gerard Neri granted the petition in part, finding that the City has a legal duty to maintain the monument in its current form and place and that the Columbus Monument Corporation was a third-party beneficiary of the City’s contract with the State, a contract in which the City promised to maintain the Monument on a long-term basis. Mayor Walsh immediately announced that the City would appeal Justice Neri’s decision. As of now, there is no date for the appeal to be heard.\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n* from ''''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In high school, he lost his first election, finishing last of three candidates for the student body presidency with a campaign that focused on aiding  orphans. Despite the loss, he became active in his school's fundraising activities for Korean orphans, including organizing a charity basketball game. Sanders attended high school with economist . When he was 19, his mother died at age 47. His father died two years later, in 1962, at age 57.\n\nSanders studied at  for a year in 1959–1960 before transferring to the  and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1964. In later interviews, Sanders described himself as a mediocre college student because the classroom was \"boring and irrelevant\" and said he viewed community activism as more important to his education.\n\n\n\n\nSanders later described his time in  as \"the major period of intellectual ferment in my life.\" While there, he joined the  (the youth affiliate of the ) and was active in the  as a student for the  (CORE) and the  (SNCC). Under his chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of the SNCC. In January 1962, he went to a rally at the  administration building to protest university president 's . At the protest, Sanders said, \"We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments\". He and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president's office. After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination. After further protests, the University of Chicago ended racial segregation in private university housing in the summer of 1963.\n\n, a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described Sanders in a 2016 interview as \"a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn't terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn't agree with.\" Sanders once spent a day putting up fliers protesting , only to notice later that Chicago police had shadowed him and taken them all down. He attended the 1963 , where  gave the \"\" speech. That summer, Sanders was fined $25 () for resisting arrest during a demonstration in  against  in Chicago's public schools.\n\nIn addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s, Sanders was active in several  while attending the University of Chicago, becoming a member of the . He applied for  status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be . Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought in it and has strongly supported  throughout his political career. He also was briefly an organizer with the  while in Chicago. He also worked on the reelection campaign of , a prominent Chicago alderman who opposed then-mayor 's . Sanders said that he spent much of his student years reading history, sociology, psychology, and the works of political authors, from , , , , and \"reading everything except what I was supposed to read for class the next day.\"\n\n\nAfter graduating from college, Sanders returned to New York City, where he worked various jobs, including Head Start teacher,  aide, and carpenter. In 1968, he moved to , a town small in both area and population (88 residents at the ) within Vermont's rural  region, because he had been \"captivated by rural life\". While there, he worked as a carpenter, filmmaker, and writer who created and sold \"radical film strips\" and other educational materials to schools. He also wrote several articles for the alternative publication ''The Vermont Freeman''. He lived in the area for several years before moving to the more populous  in the mid-1970s. During his  reelection campaign, he returned to the town to hold an event with voters and other candidates.\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Sanders resided in . After moving to , he began his electoral political career as a member of the , a national umbrella party for various socialist-oriented state parties, originating in the  movement and the . He ran as the Liberty Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate in the special election for U.S. senator in 1972 and in the general election in 1974. In the 1974 senatorial race, he finished third (5,901 votes; 4%), behind 34-year-old  state's attorney  (; 70,629 votes; 49%) and two-term incumbent U.S. Representative  (; 66,223 votes; 46%).\n\nThe 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union's influence, with Sanders collecting 11,317 votes for governor and the party. His strong performance forced the down-ballot races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the  or  candidate for those offices from garnering a majority of votes. But the campaign drained the Liberty Union's finances and energy, and in October 1977, Sanders and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party. During the , Sanders was one of three electors for the  in Vermont.\n\nAfter resigning from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, Sanders worked as a writer and as the director of the nonprofit American People's Historical Society (APHS). While with the APHS, he produced a 30-minute documentary about American labor leader , who ran for president five times as the Socialist Party candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 8, 1980, Sanders announced his candidacy for mayor. He formally announced his campaign on December 16 at a City Hall press conference. Sanders selected Linda Niedweske as his campaign manager. The  attempted to nominate Greg Guma for mayor, but Guma declined, saying it would be \"difficult to run against another progressive candidate\". Sanders had been convinced to run for the mayoralty by his close friend , an Orthodox Jewish professor of religious studies at the , who had shown him a ward-by-ward breakdown of the , in which Sanders had run, that showed him receiving 12% of the vote in Burlington despite only getting 6% statewide.\n\nSanders initially won the mayoral election by 22 votes against incumbent mayor Gordon Paquette, Richard Bove, and Joseph McGrath, but the margin was later reduced to 10 votes. Paquette did not contest the results of the recount.\n\nPaquette's loss was attributed to his own shortcomings, as he did not campaign or promote his candidacy since neither Sanders nor Bove was seen as a serious challenger. Sanders had not previously won an election. Paquette was also considered to have lost because he proposed an unpopular $0.65 per $100 raise in taxes that Sanders opposed. Sanders spent around $4,000 on his campaign.\n\nSanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders were elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The result shocked the local political establishment.\n\nSanders formed a coalition between independents and the Citizens Party. On December 3, 1982, he announced that he would seek reelection. On January 22, 1983, the Citizens Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders, although Sanders ran as an independent. He was reelected, defeating  and James Gilson.\n\nSanders initially considered not seeking a third term but announced on December 5, 1984, that he would run. He formally launched his campaign on December 7 and was reelected. On December 1, 1986, Sanders, who had finished third in the , announced that he would seek reelection to a fourth term as mayor of Burlington, despite close associates saying that he was tired of being mayor. Sanders defeated Democratic nominee Paul Lafayette in the election. He said he would not seek another mayoral term after the 1987 election: \"eight years is enough and I think it is time for new leadership, which does exist within the coalition, to come up\".\n\nSanders did not run for a fifth term as mayor. He went on to lecture in political science at  that year and at  in 1991.\n\n\nDuring his mayoralty, Sanders called himself a  and was described as such in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first  city councilor , formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the . The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under his leadership, Burlington balanced its city budget; attracted a minor league baseball team, the , then the  affiliate of the ; became the first U.S. city to fund ; and successfully sued the local  franchise, thereby winning reduced rates for customers.\n\nAs mayor, Sanders also led extensive  projects. One of his primary achievements was improving Burlington's  waterfront. In 1981, he campaigned against the unpopular plans by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial waterfront property owned by the  into expensive condominiums, hotels, and offices. He ran under the slogan \"Burlington is not for sale\" and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the waterfront area into a  district featuring housing, parks, and public spaces.\n\nSanders was a consistent  in  throughout the 1980s. In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by . In his introduction, he praised Chomsky as \"a very vocal and important voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America\" and said that he was \"delighted to welcome a person who I think we're all very proud of.\"\n\nSanders hosted and produced a  program, ''Bernie Speaks with the Community'', from 1986 to 1988. He collaborated with 30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, '''', in 1987. That same year, '''' ranked Sanders one of America's best mayors. , Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the United States.\n\nDuring a trip to the  in 1988, Sanders interviewed the mayor of Burlington's sister city  about housing and health care issues in the two cities.\n\nWhen Sanders left office in 1989, Bouricius, a member of the Burlington city council, said that Sanders had \"changed the entire nature of politics in Burlington and also in the state of Vermont\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1988, incumbent Republican congressman  decided to run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing . Former   won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic state representative  placed third with 19%. Two years later, he ran for the seat again and defeated Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.\nSanders was the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since  of  won his second term in 1952, }} as well as the first socialist elected to the House since , from the , who won his last term in 1948. Sanders was a representative from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 , when he won by 3%, with 50% of the vote.\n\n\n to reform the healthcare system]]\nDuring his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as . In 1991, he co-founded the , a group of mostly liberal Democrats that he chaired for its first eight years, while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.\n\nIn 2005, '''' called Sanders the \"amendment king\" for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control. Being an independent allowed him to form coalitions across party lines.\n\n\nIn 1999, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the  provisions that kept  and commercial banks separate entities. He was a vocal critic of  ; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion, Sanders told him he was concerned that he was \"way out of touch\" and \"that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations.\"\n\n\nConcerned by high breast cancer rates in Vermont, on February 7, 1992, Sanders sponsored the Cancer Registries Amendment Act to establish  to collect data on cancer. Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a companion bill in the Senate on October 2, 1992. The Senate bill was passed by the House on October 6 and signed into law by President  on October 24, 1992.\n\n\nIn 1993, Sanders voted against the , which mandated federal background checks when buying guns and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238–187. He voted against the bill four more times in the 1990s, explaining his Vermont constituents saw waiting-period mandates as more appropriately a state than federal matter.\n\nSanders did vote for other gun-control measures. For example, in 1994, he voted for the  \"because it included the  and the ban on certain assault weapons.\" He was nevertheless critical of the other parts of the bill. Although he acknowledged that \"clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and , and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them\", he maintained that governmental policies played a large part in \"dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence\" and argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, saying, \"we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails.\"\n\nSanders has at times favored stronger law enforcement and sentencing.

In February 2016, both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten. Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just before the , citing a need to devote her time to making direct contact with California voters and preparing for the general election.

The ''Times''  reviewed her paper's coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that  the ''Times'' \"hasn't always taken it very seriously.

Studies concluded that the tone of media coverage of Sanders was more favorable than that of any other candidate, whereas his main opponent in the democratic primary, Hillary Clinton, received the most negative coverage of any candidate. All 2016 candidates received vastly less media coverage than Donald Trump, and the Democratic primary received substantially less coverage than the Republican primary.\n\n of '''' noted that on March 15,  III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, , and  were broadcast in full.

Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates ever polled, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating. Polls showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but that those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders. A 2017 analysis in ''Newsweek'' found that 12% of those who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the general election, a lower proportion than that of Clinton supporters in  who voted for .\n\n\n\nIn July 2016, a leak of the Democratic National Committee's emails appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders. Staff repeatedly discussed making his irreligious tendencies a potential campaign issue in southern states and questioned his party loyalty. DNC chair  called his campaign manager \"an ''ass''\" and \"a damn liar\". Speaking with  on , Sanders responded to the leak, saying, \"it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: the function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidatesto be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\"\n\n\n\n in October 2016]]\n\nAfter the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee. On July 12, Sanders formally  Clinton. He said he would continue to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement progressive positions. Sanders refused to formally concede before the convention. He spoke at the  on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity.

Sanders rejected the investigation's conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign. Furthermore, he questioned the Clinton campaign's lack of action to prevent Russian interference. He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign.

He had declined the  nomination for U.S. Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018, which caused an unsuccessful legal challenge to his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Along with his 2019 campaign announcement, he said he would abide by a new Democratic Party rule for presidential candidates and that he would affirm his membership in that party. On March 5, 2019, he signed a formal statement, known as a \"loyalty pledge\", that he is a member of the Democratic Party and will serve as a Democrat if elected.

It enlisted several former  employees to produce professional videos for wide social media distribution, live-streamed various forums to its millions of social media followers, and launched a  and smartphone app for grassroots organizing.\n\n\nSanders's 2020 campaign employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a  and relying predominantly on small-dollar contributions. According to  filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money in the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races. In September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million donors.

Hall opposed a bill which would order the state to repay all of its bills within 30 days, stating that it didn't solve the problem and \"would only make us think we're doing something\". Hall also opposed a budget which would marginally cut spending and levy small taxes, such as a 4-cent  and a 5% phone tax, stating that \"cutting 10 percent and 20 percent isn't going to do.

She also said the small towns were effectively trapped in the SAU as long as the larger towns were able to out-vote the smaller towns.\n\nIn 1971, Hall sponsored legislation which would establish a volunteer corps to provide assistance and counseling to minors who violated the law. In 1973, she sponsored a bill which would create a scholarship program for college students from New Hampshire.

During her 2008 state senate campaign, Hall stated that she opposed funding education from property taxes, instead supporting a \"pay-as-you-go\" model.\n\n\nIn 1972, Hall supported an  bill which would restrict candidates from working in polling places in which their name was on the ballot. She was the only representative from a small town to support the bill. Introduced by state representative , the bill had public support, but faced heavy opposition in the House after being \"verbally beaten into the ground by many state representatives from small towns who double as election officials in their home communities\". In her support for the bill, Hall said that it could allow for more people to become involved in the political process.\n\nWhile with Common Cause in 1977, Hall supported a state ethics commission to watch over the state legislature, stating that at the time New Hampshire was the only state that didn't have conflict-of-interest legislation. In 1979, Hall supported a rule change in the state house that would require all members of the House to list their sources of income. In the mid-2000s, Hall stated her concerned with the outsourcing of New Hampshire's  to private companies, citing security and integrity concerns. In 2006, Hall proposed a bill which would make primary and general election days a state holiday. The same year, Hall supported a rules change in the state house which would end segregated party seating, which she said increased partisanship by keeping members of opposing parties separated from each other. During her independent candidacies, Hall also advocated for elections to be publicly funded in order to limit the effects of corporate influence on elections. Due to her work on campaign finance reform, Hall was frequently compared to , who she was friends with, and with whom she collaborated on election reform issues with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Powell was unanimously confirmed by the  by voice vote on January 20, 2001, and ceremonially sworn in on January 26. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in thirty years.

The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly that which was single-sourced to the informant known as . Powell later recounted how Vice President  had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, \"You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points.\" Powell's longtime  and Chief of Staff from 1989 to 2003, Colonel , later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to \"go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too.\"\n\nIn September 2005, Powell was asked about the speech during an interview with  and responded that it was a \"blot\" on his record. He went on to say, \"It will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now.\"\n\nWilkerson later said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the American people in preparing Powell's erroneous testimony before the United Nations Security Council.\n\nAs recounted in ''Soldier: The Life of Colin Powell'', in 2001 before 9/11, , a  holdover from the Clinton administration, pushed the new Bush administration for action against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, a move opposed by  who advocated for the creation of a \"U.S.-protected, opposition-run 'liberated' enclave around the southern Iraqi city of Basra\". Powell referred to Wolfowitz and other top members of Donald Rumsfeld's staff \"as the 'JINSA crowd,' \" in reference to the pro-Israel . Again invoking \"the JINSA crowd\" Powell also attributed the decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003 to the  belief that regime change in Baghdad \"was a first and necessary stop on the road to peace in Jerusalem.\"\n\nA review of ''Soldier'' by  criticized Powell's remarks as a \"blot on his record\", accusing Powell of slandering \"neoconservatives in the Defense Department – nearly all of them Jews\" with \"old and wholly unmeritorious allegations of dual loyalty\". A 2007 article about fears that Jewish groups \"will be accused of driving America into a war with the regime in Tehran\" cited the DeYoung biography and quoted JINSA's then-executive director, Thomas Neumann, as \"surprised\" Powell \"would single out a Jewish group when naming those who supported the war.\" Neumann said, \"I am not accusing Powell of anything, but these are words that the antisemites will use in the future\".\n\n]]\n\nOnce  had been deposed, Powell's renewed role was to once again establish a working international coalition, this time to assist in the rebuilding of post-war Iraq. On September 13, 2004, Powell testified before the , acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 UN presentation were \"wrong\" and that it was \"unlikely\" that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that \"what one person knew, everyone else knew\".\n\n\nAdditionally, Powell was critical of other aspects of  in the past, such as its support for the  that deposed the democratically elected president  in favor of . From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event: \"I can't justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time. It was a different time. There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world. Communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world. It was a threat to the United States.\" In another interview, he also simply stated: \"With respect to your earlier comment about Chile in the 1970s and what happened with Mr. Allende, it is not a part of American history that we're proud of.\"\n\n speaking on behalf of the United States's involvement in recovery efforts following the  (January 5, 2005).]]\nIn the  of April 1, 2001, a United States US  surveillance aircraft collided mid-air with a Chinese  jet fighter over the South China Sea.

The following day, Bush nominated National Security Advisor  as Powell's successor.\n\nIn mid-November, Powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that Iran was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system. The accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between Iran, the , and the European Union.\n\nAlthough biographer Jeffrey J. Matthews is highly critical of how Powell misled the United Nations Security Council regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, he credits Powell with a series of achievements at the State Department. These include restoration of morale to psychologically demoralized professional diplomats, leadership of the international  initiative, resolving a crisis with China, and blocking efforts to tie Saddam Hussein to the  on the United States.\n\n\nAfter retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life. In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators  and , at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of  as , but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush's first term). The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation. Bolton was put into the position via a  because of the strong opposition in the Senate.\n\n, 2004]]\nOn April 28, 2005, an opinion piece in '''' by  (a former top aide to President ) claimed that Powell was in fact \"conducting a campaign\" against Bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together, which among other things had resulted in Powell cutting Bolton out of talks with Iran and  after complaints about Bolton's involvement from the British. Blumenthal added that \"The foreign relations committee has discovered that Bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the . Staff members on the committee believe that Bolton was probably spying on Powell, his senior advisors and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that Bolton opposed.\"\n\nIn September 2005, Powell criticized the response to , and said thousands of people were not properly protected because they were poor, rather than because they were black.\n\n, Vice President , and former President , Saudi Arabia, August 2005]]\nOn January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the  of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials.

Powell was  regarding , and expressed some support for an . He stated in his autobiography that he supported  that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving persons because of racial issues. Powell originally suggested the  policy to President Clinton, though he later supported its repeal as proposed by  and Admiral  in January 2010, saying \"circumstances had changed\". \n\n\nPowell gained attention in 2004 when, in a conversation with  , he reportedly referred to  within the Bush administration as \"fucking crazies\".\n\nIn a September 2006 letter to , Powell expressed opposition to President Bush's push for  of those formerly and currently classified as . Specifically, he objected to the effort in Congress to \"redefine Common Article 3 of the .\" He also asserted: \"The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.\"\n\n\nAt the 2007  in Colorado, Powell stated that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush \"the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers\". During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: \"I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you.\"\n\nIn a 2008 interview on , Powell reiterated his support for the 2003 decision to  in the context of his endorsement of , stating: \"My role has been very, very straightforward. I wanted to avoid a war. The president [Bush] agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn't get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war.\"\n\nPowell's position on the  was less consistent. In December 2006, he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the U.S. military had enough troops to carry it out successfully. He stated: \"I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into  for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work.\" Following his endorsement of Barack Obama in October 2008, however, Powell praised  and U.S. troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that \"it's starting to turn around\". By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of U.S. forces in Iraq should have come sooner, perhaps in late 2003.\n\n\nPowell donated the maximum allowable amount to 's campaign in the summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible  for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the .\n\nMcCain won the Republican presidential nomination, but the Democrats nominated the first black candidate, Senator  of Illinois.

Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing  as the vice presidential candidate, stating that despite the fact that she is admired, \"now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president.\" He said that Obama's choice for vice president, , was ready to be president. He also added that he was \"troubled\" by the \"false intimations that Obama was Muslim.\" Powell stated that \"[Obama] is a Christianhe's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America.\" Powell then mentioned , a  soldier in the  who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, \"Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me.\" Powell concluded his  comments with \"It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a . I think we need a president who is a  and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen.

And I think the Republican Party needs me more than the Democratic Party needs me. And you can be a Republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration, and improving our education system, and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country. I don't think there's anything inconsistent with this.\"\n\n\nIn a July 2009  interview with , Powell expressed concern over President Obama increasing the size of the federal government and the size of the federal budget deficit. In September 2010, he criticized the  for not focusing \"like a razor blade\" on the economy and job creation. Powell reiterated that Obama was a \"transformational figure.\" In a video that aired on CNN.com in November 2011, Colin Powell said in reference to Barack Obama, \"many of his decisions have been quite sound. The financial system was put back on a stable basis.\"\n\nOn October 25, 2012, 12 days before the , he gave his endorsement to President Obama for re-election during a broadcast of ''''. He considered the administration to have had success and achieved progress in foreign and domestic policy arenas.

He called on GOP leaders to publicly denounce such talk.\n\n\nPowell was very vocal on the state of the Republican Party. Speaking at a Washington Ideas forum in early October 2015, he warned the audience that the Republican Party had begun a move to the fringe right, lessening the chances of a Republican White House in the future. He also remarked on Republican presidential candidate 's statements regarding immigrants, noting that there were many immigrants working in Trump hotels.\n\nIn March 2016, Powell denounced the \"nastiness\" of the  during an interview on .

Powell privately reiterated his comments regarding Clinton's email scandal, writing, \"I have told Hillary's minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try,\" and complaining that \"Hillary's mafia keeps trying to suck me into it\" in another email. In another email discussing Clinton's controversy, Powell said she should have told everyone what she did \"two years ago\", and said that she has not \"been covering herself with glory.\" Writing on the  controversy surrounding Clinton, Powell said to then U.S. Ambassador , \"Benghazi is a stupid witch hunt.\" Commenting on Clinton in a general sense, he mused that \"Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris\", and in another email stated \"I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect.\"\n\nPowell called Donald Trump a \"national disgrace\", with \"no sense of shame\". He wrote of Trump's role in the  movement, which he called \"racist\". He suggested the media ignore Trump: \"To go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him.\" The emails were obtained by the media as the result of a hack.\n\nPowell endorsed Clinton on October 25, 2016, stating it was \"because I think she's qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified\".\n\nDespite not running in the election, Powell received three electoral votes for president from  in Washington who had pledged to vote for Clinton, coming in third overall. After Barack Obama, he was the second black person to receive electoral votes in a presidential election.\n\n\nIn an interview in October 2019, Powell warned that the GOP needed to \"get a grip\" and put the country before their party, standing up to then president Trump rather than worrying about political fallout. He said: \"When they see things that are not right, they need to say something about it because our foreign policy is in shambles right now, in my humble judgment, and I see things happening that are hard to understand.\" On June 7, 2020, Powell announced he would be voting for former Vice President  in the .

As a police officer, he challenged the discriminatory policies of the , publicly protesting in front of the station, often carrying young McKinney on his shoulders. He was elected as a state representative. McKinney attributes her father's election victory, after several failed attempts, to the passage of the , which provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voting.

In 1984, she served as a diplomatic fellow at  in , . She then taught political science at  in  and at .\n\n\n\nMcKinney's political career began when her father, a representative in the , submitted her name as a  for the Georgia state house in 1986. Despite the fact that she lived in Jamaica at the time, she received approximately 40% of the popular vote. In 1988, McKinney ran for the same seat and won, making the McKinneys the first father and daughter to simultaneously serve in the Georgia House of Representatives. In 1991, she decried the  in a speech on the House floor; many legislators left the chamber in protest of her remarks.\n\n\nIn the , McKinney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as the member of Congress from the newly created 11th District, a 64%  majority district reaching from Atlanta to . She was the first African American woman to represent Georgia in the House. She was re-elected in .\n\nIn 1995, the  ruled in '''' that the 11th District was an   because the boundaries were drawn based on the racial composition of the constituents. McKinney's district was subsequently renumbered as the 4th and redrawn to take in almost all of , prompting outrage from McKinney. She asserted that it was a racially discriminatory ruling, given the fact that the Supreme Court had previously ruled that , which is 91% white, was unconstitutional. The new 4th, however, was no less Democratic than the 11th. McKinney was easily elected from this district in . She was re-elected two more times with no substantive opposition.\n\nIn her first period in Congress, she served on several committees, including the House Committees on , , and . She eventually ascended to the top Democratic spot on the International Relations Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, serving as ranking member. In that role, she became a frequent critic of American foreign policy. Examples include her vocal opposition to President ’s interventionist policies in , U.S. sanctions against Iraq, and other policies related to the Middle East.\n\nOn October 17, 2001, McKinney introduced a bill calling for \"the suspension of the use, sale, development, production, testing, and export of  munitions pending the outcome of certain studies of the health effects of such munitions.\" The bill was cosponsored by Reps. , ; , -; , D-; , D-; and , D-.\n\n\nDuring the 2000 presidential campaign, McKinney wrote that \"'s  tolerance level has never been too high. I've never known him to have more than one black person around him at any given time.\" Gore's campaign pointed out that its manager, , was black.\n\nMcKinney chastised Gore for failing to support the  of  trying to oppose  drilling near them. In a press release issued on February 22, 2000, entitled \"No More Blood For Oil,\" McKinney wrote that \"Oil drilling on Uwa land will result in considerable environmental damage and social conflict which will lead to greater  of the region as well as an increase in violence.\" Addressing herself to Gore, she wrote, \"I am contacting you because you have remained silent on this issue despite your strong financial interests and family ties with .\"\n\n\nMcKinney and other members of the House of Representatives objected to the 25 electoral votes from  which  narrowly won after a contentious . Because no senator joined her objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President , who was Bush's opponent in the . Without Florida's electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the .\n\n\nMcKinney gained national attention for her remarks following the  in 2001. She asserted that the United States had \"numerous warnings of the events to come\" and called for an investigation. She enquired in a radio interview: \"What did this administration know and when did it know it?\" She said that   may have been aware and allowed them to happen. She made allegations about the earlier president, : \"It is known that President Bush's father, through , hadat the time of the attacksjoint business interests with the  construction company and many defense industry holdings, the stocks of which have soared since September 11.\" A spokesman for the Carlyle Group rejected her hypothesis. In a statement in April 2002, McKinney told '''': \"I am not aware of any evidence showing that President Bush or members of his administration have personally profited from the attacks of 9–11. A complete investigation might reveal that to be the case.\"\n\nIn the month that followed the attacks, McKinney published an open letter to the  Prince . The  mayor  had refused to cash a $10 million check written by Saudi Prince because of the Prince's suggestion that the attacks were an indication that the United States \"should re-examine its policies in the  and adopt a more balanced stand toward the  cause.\" In the open letter, she expressed her disappointment at Giuliani's action: \"Let me say that there are a growing number of people in the United States who recognize, like you, that U.S. policy in the Middle East needs serious examination...Your Royal Highness, many of us here in the United States have long been concerned about reports by  and  that reveal a pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by  in situations where Palestinian demonstrators were unarmed and posed no threat of death or serious injury to the security forces or to others.\"\n\n\nIn 2002, McKinney was defeated in the Democratic  by DeKalb County judge . Majette defeated McKinney with 58% of the vote to McKinney's 42%.\n\nMcKinney protested the result in court, claiming that thousands of  had voted in the Democratic primary, the real contest in the district, in revenge for her anti- views and her allegations of voter fraud in  in the . Like 20 other states, Georgia operates an : voters do not align with a  when they register to vote and may participate in whichever party's primary election they choose. Thus, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in '''', which had held that California's  violated the  (despite the fact that the Court explicitly differentiatedalbeit in dictathe blanket primary from the open primary in ''Jones''), on McKinney's behalf, five voters claimed that the open primary system was unconstitutional, operating in violation of the  of the , the associational right protected by the , and various statutory rights protected by § 2 of the .\n\nThe district court dismissed the case, in the judgement stating the plaintiffs had presented no evidence in support of the 14th Amendment and Voting Rights Act claims, and lacked standing to bring the First Amendment claim. It interpreted the Supreme Court's ''Jones'' ruling to hold that the right to association involved in a dispute over a primaryand thus, standing to suebelongs to a political party, not an individual voter. On appeal in May 2004, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this result in ''Osburn v. Cox'', assessing that not only were the plaintiffs' claims meritless, but the remedy they requested would likely be unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's decision in ''Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut''. On October 18, 2004, the Supreme Court brought an end to the litigation, denying  without comment.\n\nOther factors in McKinney's defeat included her allegations of  involvement in 9/11, her opposition to aid to , a perceived support of  and  causes, and open  in her comments. On the night before the primary election, McKinney's father stated on Atlanta television that \"s have bought everybody. Jews. J-E-W-S.\" Cynthia McKinney had been through a long contentious relationship with the  (AIPAC). Georgia political analyst Bill Shipp addressed McKinney's defeat saying: \"voters sent a message: 'We're tired of these over-the-top congressmen dealing in great international and national interests. How about somebody looking out for our interests?'\"\n\n\n\nDuring 2003 and 2004, McKinney toured the US and much of  publicly speaking about her defeat, her , and the Bush administration.\n\nIn 2004, McKinney served on the advisory committee for the group 2004 Racism Watch. \n\nHaving made no secret that she wanted to return to Congress, McKinney turned down the  nomination for president in the .\n\n\nMajette declined to run for re-election to the House, opting instead to become a candidate to replace retiring  , a  Democrat. According to a report in '''',  believed it was \"going to be a real battle\" for McKinney to return to Congress. It was feared McKinney's previous comments would have a negative effect on her chances. Since it was taken for granted that victory in the Democratic primary was  in November, McKinney's opponents focused on clearing the field for a single candidate who could force her into a .\n\nMcKinney hosted the first delegation of Afro-Latinos from  and  and worked with the  and the U.S. State Department to recognize Afro-Latinos.

The day-long briefing featured family members of victims, scholars, former intelligence officers and others who critiqued the  account of 9/11 and its recommendations. The four morning panels addressed flaws, omissions, and a lack of historical and political analysis in the commission's report. Three afternoon panels critiqued the commission's recommendations in the areas of foreign and domestic policy and intelligence reform. An '''' editorial said that the purpose of the event was to discuss whether or not the Bush administration was involved in the 9/11 attacks, expressing surprise that McKinney was once again taking on the issue that was believed to have cost her House seat. The ''Journal-Constitution'' declined to publish McKinney's reply. The 9/11 Commission has sealed all the notes and transcripts of some 2,000 interviews, all the forensic evidence, and both classified and non-classified documents used in compiling its final report until January 2, 2009. McKinney's interest in 9/11 relates specifically to what she expresses as her opposition to excessive government secrecy, which she has challenged with numerous pieces of legislation.\n\nMcKinney has said that she \"remain[s] hopeful that we will learn the truth\" about 9/11 \"because more and more people around the world are demanding it.\"\n\n\nMcKinney was an advocate for victims of 2005's  and a critic of the government's response to it. Over 100,000 evacuees from  and  relocated to the Atlanta area, and many have now settled there.\n\nDuring the Katrina crisis, evacuees were turned away by 's Gretna police when they attempted to cross the  Bridge between  and . McKinney was the only member of Congress to participate in a march across the Crescent City Connection Bridge on November 7, 2005, to protest what had happened on that bridge in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIn response, McKinney introduced a bill on November 2, 2005, that would temporarily deny federal assistance to the City of Gretna Police Department, 's Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, and the , in the state of . The bill was referred to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, but was not acted on. However, in August 2006, a  began an investigation of the incident. On October 31, 2007, the Grand Jury ruled not to charge anyone. The Grand Jury accepted Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson's explanation, \"Some of the people in the crowd acted aggressively and threatened to throw one of the officers off the bridge, the chief said. The shot was fired over the officer's shoulder and over the side of the bridge.\n\nMcKinney chose to be an active participant in the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to , although the Democratic Party leadership called for Democratic members to boycott the committee. She submitted her own 72-page report. She sat as a guest along with only a few other Democrats. In questioning  Secretary , McKinney referred to a news story in which the owners of a  had been charged with negligent  for abandoning 34 clients who died in the flood waters. McKinney asked Chertoff: \"Mr. Secretary, if the nursing home owners are arrested for negligent homicide, why shouldn't you also be arrested for negligent homicide?\"\n\nThe ' Omnibus Bill (HR 4197) was introduced on November 2, 2005, to provide a comprehensive response to the  residents affected by . The second title of the bill was submitted by McKinney, seeking a Comprehensive Environmental Sampling and Toxicity Assessment Plan, or CESTAP, to minimize harm to Gulf Coast residents from the toxic releases into the environment caused by the hurricane.\n\nAt the request of McKinney, the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina, chaired by , held a previously unscheduled hearing titled \"Voices Inside the Storm\" on December 6, 2005.\n\nMcKinney, in collaboration with Rep.  (CA), produced a \"Katrina Legislative Summary,\" a chart summarizing House and  bills on Hurricane Katrina. On June 13, 2006, McKinney said on the House floor that only a dozen of the 176 Katrina bills identified on the chart had passed into law, leaving 163 bills stalled in committee.\n\nOn August 2, 2007, McKinney participated in a press conference in  to launch an International Tribunal on Hurricanes Katrina and , which she described as an effort to seek justice for the victims of those hurricanes and their aftermath.\n\n\nUntil 2000, McKinney served on the House International Relations Committee, where she was the highest-ranking Democrat on the Human Rights Subcommittee. McKinney worked on legislation to stop conventional weapons transfers to governments that are  or fail to respect .\n\nOn November 18, 2005, McKinney was one of only three House members to vote for H.R. 571, introduced by , chairman of the , on which McKinney sat. Hunter, a Republican, offered this resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in place of 's H.J.Res. 73, which called for redeployment \"at the earliest possible date.\" In her prepared statement, McKinney accused the Republicans of \"trying to set a trap for the Democrats. A 'no' vote for this Resolution will obscure the fact that there is strong support for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq ... In voting for this bill, let me be perfectly clear that I am not saying the United States should exit Iraq without a plan. I agree with Mr. Murtha that security and stability in Iraq should be pursued through diplomacy. I simply want to vote 'yes' to an orderly withdrawal from Iraq.\"\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the 2006 legislative session, McKinney introduced  of  against President  as (H Res 1106), which made three charges against Bush:\n* Failure to uphold the constitution, specifically that \"George Walker Bush ... in preparing the invasion of Iraq, did withhold intelligence from the Congress, by refusing to provide Congress with the full intelligence picture that he was being given, by redacting information ... and actively manipulating the intelligence on Iraq’s alleged weapons programs by pressuring the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies.\n* Abuse of office and , \"obstructing and hindering the work of Congressional investigative bodies and by seeking to expand the scope of the powers of his office.\"\n* Failure to ensure that laws are faithfully executed, specifically by a program of illegal domestic spying and circumvention of the  Act.\n\nThe second article also made charges against Vice President  alleging he manipulated intelligence in order to justify the Iraq War, and against Secretary of State  alleging that she knowingly made false statements concerning 's  program.\n\nMcKinney's bill was abandoned when it failed to clear the .\n\n\n\nOn the morning of March 29, 2006, McKinney entered the 's southeast entrance and proceeded past the security checkpoint, walking around the metal detector.  have identifying lapel pins and were not required to pass through metal detectors at the time. The officers present failed to recognize McKinney as a member of Congress because she was not wearing the appropriate lapel pin and had recently changed her hairstyle. She proceeded westward down the ground floor hallway and about halfway down the hallway was stopped by United States Capitol Police officer Paul McKenna, who states that he had been calling after her: \"Ma'am, Ma'am!\"; at that time it is reported that McKinney struck the officer. Two days later, Officer McKenna filed a police report claiming that McKinney had struck \"his chest with a closed fist\".\n\nIn the midst of a media frenzy, McKinney made an apology on the floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 2006, neither admitting to nor denying the charge, stating only that: \"There should not have been any physical contact in this incident.\"\n\nThough McKinney was not indicted for criminal charges or subjected to disciplinary action by the House, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police said of Officer McKenna, \"We're going to make sure the officer won't be harassed. We want the officer to be able talk to experts, who can look at his legal recourses, if he needed to.\"\n\n\nIn the wake of the March 2006 incident with the Capitol Police officer, McKinney was in the news, and her office invited the media to attend one of her monthly \"District Days,\" where she spends one full day meeting with constituents to discuss issues of concern. At her April 23, 2006, \"District Days\" event, McKinney was being interviewed by 's , who repeatedly questioned her about the March 29 scuffle with a Capitol police officer. Frustrated, McKinney stood up and apparently forgot she was still wearing the . Her offscreen comments were captured on tape. She was heard saying, \"Oh, crap, now you know what ... they lied to [McKinney's senior aide Coz Carson], and Coz is a fool.\" McKinney returned on screen with the microphone, this time with instructions on what parts of the interview the station was allowed to use: \"anything that is captured by your audio ... that is captured while I'm not seated in this chair is off the record and is not permissible to be used ... is that understood?\"\n\n\nMcKinney submitted to Congress two different versions of the same bill, the \"\" (one in 2003, the other in 2005), which, if signed into law, would release all currently sealed files concerning the 1968  These records were sealed in 1978 and are not due to be declassified until the year 2028. The 2005 version of the MLK Records Act, HR 2554 had 67 cosponsors by the time McKinney left office at the end of 2006. A Senate version of the bill (S2499) was introduced by Senator  and was co-signed by Sen. . The bill has also received numerous endorsements from former members of the .\n\n\nDocuments relating to the death of rapper , in which McKinney took an active interest, would be released under another bill she would introduce. In a statement, McKinney explained her reason for the bill: \"The public has the right to know because he was a well-known figure. There is intense public interest in the life and death of Tupac Shakur.\" Legislation demanding release of records is a more direct route than requesting their release through the  (FOIA).\n\n\n\nMcKinney finished first in the July 18, 2006 Democratic primary, edging DeKalb County Commissioner  47.1% to 44.4%, with a third candidate receiving 8.5%. However, as McKinney failed to get at least 50% of the vote, she and Johnson were forced into a runoff.\n\nIn the runoff of August 8, 2006, McKinney received about the same number of votes as in the July primary, even though there were about 8,000 more votes cast in the runoff than in the primary. Johnson won with 41,178 votes (59%) to McKinney's 28,832 (41%). McKinney's loss was attributed to a mid-decade redistricting, in which the 4th had absorbed portions of  and  Counties, as well as her run-in with a police officer in the .\n\nCNN reported that during her concession speech, McKinney hardly mentioned her opponent but praised the  political leaders elected in .

Why not have the Green Party provide the blueprint and the road map?\"\n\nAt an August 27, 2007, peace rally in , McKinney confirmed the depth of her disenchantment with the Democratic Party, urging San Francisco voters to replace  with antiwar activist . On September 10, in a letter to the steering committee of the Green Party of the United States, McKinney stated she would not seek the Green Party nomination for president. However, in early October it appeared that McKinney was making moves toward declaring herself an official Green Party candidate.\n\nOn July 9, 2008, she named as her running mate journalist and community activist  and clinched the party's nomination three days later at the .\n\nOn September 10, 2008, McKinney joined a press conference held by third-party and independent candidates, along with , , and initiator .

Members of the crew claimed that the ship was rammed, gunfire was directed at the water, and the ship was forced to dock in Lebanon after taking on water.

McKinney initially refused to sign the deportation papers because they were written in Hebrew and that the papers would require them to admit that they were in violation of Israel's blockade, which they denied.

And as a revolutionary state, they understand colonialism, neo-colonialism, and imperialism. They understand being under the foot of oppression and occupationeven if it is mental occupationfrom an outside force or outside power, and that is what centers the resistance\".\n\n\nMcKinney announced in April 2012 that she would run for the 4th congressional district against  on the  ticket.

In May 2020, '''' and other medial outlets reported that McKinney released a series of statements via Twitter questioning the true number of Jewish people murdered during .

She gave remarks at the rally by video, where she claimed that there are \"criminal elements\" within the , that the Democratic Party had become a \",\" that the  can \",\" and more. \n\nOn September 11, 2023, McKinney promoted a livestream called \"Can Black People and White People Work Together to Defeat Our Common Enemy\" with the , indicating that the \"common enemy\" is the Jewish people. The livestream was hosted by , the author of ''Jews Are the Problem'' and described by the ADL as an \"anti-Semitic and an anti-LGBTQ+ Black nationalist extremist\" and , a white-supremacist, former  Grand Wizard and anti-Semite.

During this council period, Grosso was the original author of 33 bills and resolutions19 of which were approved by the D.C. Council.\n\nGrosso named education reform as a top priority. In 2013, as a member of the council's Committee on Education, Grosso sponsored a measure on school suspensions and expulsions that was added to the Attendance Accountability Amendment Act of 2013. The provision required the Office of the State Superintendent of Education to develop an annual report with findings and recommendations for schools to reduce or eliminate the use of out of school suspensions and expulsions, except for extreme cases.

The Council approved the resolution unanimously. Grosso suggested that the team adopt the name \"Redtails\" in honor of the .\n\nIn 2013, Grosso introduced the Marijuana Legalization and Regulation Act as a result of reports produced by the  and the American Civil Liberties Union indicating that 91% of all marijuana arrests in D.C. were of African Americans, although research shows that the use of marijuana is roughly equal between both African Americans and Whites. Although no members joined Grosso to co-sponsor this bill, eventually the Council passed a law to decriminalize possession of marijuana, and the residents of D.C. voted overwhelmingly to legalize possessing and growing the plant. Although Grosso reintroduced the bill in 2015, a Congressional rider on the D.C. budget was interpreted to prohibit the holding of a hearing on the legislationthis time co-introduced by three other members, and three Committees were prepared to act on the bill, showing the progress made on the issue.\n\nA companion bill to the Marijuana Legalization and Regulation Act was the Record Sealing for Non-Violent Marijuana Possession Act of 2013, a bill to seal the arrest and conviction records for non-violent marijuana charges. Grosso's intent for this legislation was to reduce barriers to employment, housing, and higher education. The Council passed the bill and it became law in March 2015.\n\nFinally, the Anti-Shackling of Incarcerated Pregnant Women Act of 2013 prohibits the shackling of incarcerated women in D.C. adult and youth detention facilities.

The Council approved the legislation in December 2014 with support from the Executive and it passed into law in May 2015. Grosso also successfully sought the repeal of Prostitution Free Zones Amendment Act of 2014, which repealed the law allowing the  to declare a specific location as a \"prostitution-free zone\" for 20 days. Grosso argued that the designation of zones were fueled by bias.\n\nGrosso also introduced the D.C. Urban Farming and Food Security Act of 2014 to establish an urban farming land leasing initiative and a real property tax abatement for small-scale urban farming. The bill was approved by the Council in December 2014 and became law in April 2015.\n\nGrosso also introduced the Fair Leave Act of 2014, to provide D.C. government employees up to six weeks of paid leave in connection with the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child, or the care of a family member who has a serious medical condition. On October 1, 2014, the eight weeks of paid family leave policy went into effect for all D.C. Government employees.\n\nIn 2014, Grosso introduced an elections reform package consisting of  (IRV, also called ranked-choice voting), open primaries, and a \"clean hands\" provision. Under IRV, voters rank candidates in order of preference. The candidate with the fewest votes is then eliminated, with those votes being re-apportioned to the remaining candidates. In support of the bill, Grosso said that IRV would result in higher voter turnout, promote positive and more widespread campaigning, and ensure that the elected candidate has true majority support. The Instant Runoff Voting Amendment Act was endorsed by the ''Washington Post'' editorial board. The Open Primary Elections Amendment Act of 2014 would allow registered voters to change their party affiliation up until Election Day in order to vote in a primary. Lastly, the Clean Hands Elections Reform Amendment Act of 2014 requires all candidates for elected office to obtain a “clean hands” certification, confirming that neither the candidate nor any of the candidate's previous campaigns or political committees owes any outstanding taxes, fines or fees to the District. This legislation had a hearing in September 2014. Grosso also introduced the Local Resident Voting Rights Act, a bill to grant voting rights for municipal elections to legal permanent non-citizen D.C. residents. Grosso's proposal to implement public financing of elections campaigns, Public Financing of Political Campaigns Amendment Act of 2013, was discussed along with a number of other elections reform bills during hearings in March 2013, but was not moved out of Committee. Grosso also supports public financing of D.C. elections.\n\nIn 2014, Grosso formed Arts Action DC, a coalition of D.C. residents in the  sector, in an effort to advocate for funding, support, and growth of the arts.\n\n\nGrosso was appointed Chairperson of the Committee on Education for the Council Period 21. Grosso is the second chair to have jurisdiction over education after the Committee became stand-alone (outside of the Committee of the Whole). His bill to prohibit suspensions and expulsions for pre-kindergarten students in D.C. Public Schools and the public charter schools was the first permanent legislation passed by the new Council. Grosso said that his education priorities were age-appropriate school discipline, attendance and truancy, mental health services, improving literacy, ending the school to prison pipeline, promoting quality early childhood education, and expanding community and family engagement.David Grosso (January 19, 2015).

Public Schools. The budget allocated $1.6 million for a new literacy intervention program, targeted at 3rd grade reading and writing success, and restored $760,000 in funding to the University of the District of Columbia.David Grosso (May 14, 2015). Grosso’s FY16 Budget Unanimously Passed by Committee on Education. http://www.davidgrosso.org/grosso-analysis/2015/5/14/grossos-fy16-budget-unanimously-passed-by-committee-on-education The budget allocated almost $700,000 to DCPS to make up for funding losses at schools such as Wilson and Ballou High Schools, and $450,000 to restore funding for SAT and ACT test preparation courses for D.C. high school students. The Budget Support Act broadened the scope of the Bullying Prevention Taskforce and extended its term until August 2018.\n\n\nGrosso was sworn into office for the new four-year council term at noon on January 2, 2017. Following the departure of school chancellor Antwan Wilson, Grosso announced that he would investigate the controversial preferential student placement that lead to his resignation. Grosso said he was willing to require Mayor Bowser to testify under oath about the practice and whether she was aware it was taking place. Three days later, following a visit from counsel to Mayor Bowser, , Grosso changed his mind and said that he would not hold a hearing, stating that the committee's efforts were better focused elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2018, Grosso voted to repeal , a referendum passed by the majority of DC voters months earlier that would phase out a tipped minimum wage. Initially, Grosso declined to say how he would vote before supporting the repeal. A report by  revealed that Grosso had accepted more than $10,000 in payments from restaurant-related interests opposed to Initiative 77.\n\nIn July 2019, Grosso was the first member of the DC Council to call for  resignation following revelations about his outside employment. In November 2019 he announced that he would not run for reelection, citing a need to live out his belief that Councilmembers should not serve more than two terms and that he wanted to encourage a new generation of progressive activists.\n\n\nDavid and Serra live in the Brookland neighborhood of Ward 5 with their dogs Frida and Diego.

In philanthropy, Walker has advocated a more action-based approach to the traditional foundation: “I do believe, however, that foundations have been very cautious and somewhat conservative about whether and to what extent they want to get involved in advocacy.” David Walker stepped down as president and CEO of the Peter G.

McReynolds was twice a candidate for , running atop the ticket of the  in 1980 and 2000. He was the 's first  presidential candidate. He was also America's first gay presidential candidate if not counting  - although multiple sources, including the , have referred to John Hospers, who was in 1972 the first presidential nominee of the newly formed Libertarian Party, as the first openly gay person to run for president of the United States, ''’s'' obituary stated that his family “strenuously denied” he was gay. \n\n\nDavid Ernest McReynolds was born in  to Elizabeth Grace (Tallon), a nurse, and Lt. Col. Charles McReynolds, an Air Force intelligence officer. Between 1957 and 1960, he worked for the  of the left-wing magazine ''''. He was  and wrote his first article about living as a gay man in 1969.\n\nMcReynolds became a member of the  in 1946 or 1947 due to his upbringing as a fundamentalist , but left the party around the same time that it expelled its entire youth section for being communist. During his time in the Prohibitionist Party he became more left-wing and he later joined the  in 1951. He became a  in 1949, and attended a pacifist youth conference in Europe in the same year during which he realized that he was homosexual and became an atheist. He attended  and graduated in 1953, and during his education he was arrested for refusing to serve in the , but the charges were dismissed. He was elected to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1954.\n\n\nMcReynolds was staunchly  and a , and in 1960 joined the staff of the  (WRL), where he remained until his retirement in 1999. In 1965, he lectured on \"The Old Left and the New Left\" at the newly founded .\n\nHe edited the League's bi-monthly, ''Liberation''. In November 1965, he persuaded  to let him publish under the title \"Sex and Caste\" a paper she had been circulating among women questioning their role and position within . The publication of the article has since been regarded as a key bridge connecting civil rights to women's liberation.\n\nThat same month, November 1965, McReynolds was one of five men who publicly  at an  at Union Square in New York.  This was one of the first public draft-card burnings after U.S. law was changed on August 30, 1965, to make such actions a felony, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.

The smallest and the most left wing faction of the SPA, known as the , including McReynolds, formed the  (SPUSA). McReynolds was long a member of both DSA and SPUSA.\n\nMcReynolds' primary theoretical contribution to socialism came from his blending of a  world-view with a commitment to re-distributive . Politically, he was a staunch  and collaborated with a diverse set of political formations on the democratic left. His widely read pamphlet, ''The Philosophy of Nonviolence'', provides a unique window into the mind of a lifelong activist wrestling with the contradictions and pitfalls which plagued the political left in the 20th century. He concludes that \"...there is no living, vital philosophy which does not have 'holes' in it.\" Consequently, he mapped out a  approach which is, on the one hand, socialist, yet is entirely engaged with thought systems as seemingly contradictory as . He concluded that a brand of pacifist-socialism is best suited for future socialist experiments since it offers the greatest opportunity to prefigure the kinds of democratic relations necessary to create a functional and free society.\n\nIn his political career, McReynolds ran for  from  twice and for  twice. In 1958, he ran as a write-in SPA candidate and then in 1968 as a  candidate for Congress in the 19th district pulling in 4.7% of the vote (3,969 votes).\n\nThe Socialist Party attempted to unite behind  as a presidential candidate with the  during the , but was unsuccessful. The party gave its presidential nomination to McReynolds and vice-presidential nomination to , the party's treasurer, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They were on the ballots in ten states and raised around $25,000 during the campaign. The purpose of his campaign was to increase the party's membership. He received more votes than , the party's presidential nominee in the , in every state except for Wisconsin which McReynolds stated was due to Zeidler's name recognition in the state.\n\n\n\nHe was given the party's presidential nomination again during the . After the 2000 election, the ''Palm Beach Post'' speculated that the vast majority of the 2,908 voters who had voided their votes by punching the names of both McReynolds and Democratic candidate Al Gore on a \"confusing \" (and also of the over 3,000 more who punched both Gore and Buchanan) had meant to vote for Gore and that mistaken voting on the Palm Beach County butterfly ballot had consequently cost Gore the state's crucial electoral votes, and therefore the election as a whole.\n\nIn January 2015, the 's National Committee voted to  McReynolds over alleged racist comments made on social media regarding the  and . He resigned from the SPUSA shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\nOn July 10, 2004, McReynolds announced his candidacy running on the  ticket for one of the New York seats in the , running an anti-war campaign against Democratic incumbent , where he pulled in 36,942 votes for 0.5% of total.\n\n\nMcReynolds was active politically until just before his death, attending meetings, speaking in classrooms, being interviewed for films and research, and participating in peace, justice, antiwar, and antinuclear actions.

He could not run in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nChambers is the longest-serving state senator in Nebraska history, having represented North Omaha for 46 years. For most of his career, Chambers was the only nonwhite senator. He is the only African-American to have run for  and the first to have run for the  in Nebraska history. For years he was the only openly  member of any .\n\n\nChambers was born in the  neighborhood of , to Malcolm Chambers, a local minister, and Lillian Chambers. His father's family originally came from Mississippi and his mother's family originally came from Louisiana. He has six siblings, who were all born in Omaha.\n\nIn 1955, Chambers graduated from . In 1959, he graduated from  with a B.A. in history, with minors in Spanish and philosophy. He attended  in the early 1960s and completed his degree in 1979.\n\nHe refused to join the , so was unable to practice law; in 2015, he explained his refusal on the grounds that he had earned the right to practice by passing law school, and should not have to pay the Bar Association dues as well.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1963, when Chambers was 25, he worked for the Omaha . He has said he was fired for insubordination because he spoke out against the management at the Post Office calling the black staff \"boys\". He picketed the Postmaster General's speech in Omaha with a sign that read, \"I spoke against discrimination in the Omaha Post Office and was fired.\"\n\n\nDuring a series of heat waves in 1966, there were two disturbances in Omaha. In July, the  was summoned to restore order after police and black teenagers clashed three nights in a row. In early August, a series of riots occurred over three nights. Chambers worked as a spokesperson for the community during both conflicts, meeting with Mayor A.V. Sorenson and helping to end the riots.\n\nDuring this period, Chambers emerged as a prominent leader in the North Omaha community, where he successfully negotiated concessions from the city's leaders on behalf of North Omaha's African-American youth. Chambers headed a committee of the  Police-Community Relations Council, collated information, and presented numerous complaints about the police to city officials. The African-American community had previously been led by more established organizations like Omaha Urban League and the local chapter of the NAACP, not an emerging young anti-establishment leader like Chambers.\n\nChambers was working as a barber at the time, and appeared in the Oscar-nominated 1966 documentary film '''', where he talked about race relations in Omaha.\n\n\nIn 1968, Chambers ran for a position on the , but was not elected. He also failed as a write-in candidate for the Omaha City Council in 1969. In 1970 he was elected to represent North Omaha's 11th District in the Nebraska State Legislature, replacing George W. Althouse, who had been appointed to replace Senator , who had died in office. During the election, a policeman was killed in a deserted house by a bomb. Two , , were charged in the death. Chambers protested, as he thought the men had been framed by .\n\nChambers was reelected to the Legislature in every ensuing election through 2004. On April 25, 2005, Chambers became Nebraska's longest-serving state senator, having served for more than 35 years. He was not allowed to seek reelection in 2008 because of a constitutional amendment Nebraska voters passed in 2000 that limits Nebraska state legislators to two consecutive four-year terms. But the amendment permits senators to seek reelection to their office after sitting out for four years, and Chambers defeated incumbent  in 2012 by a \"landslide\".\n\nChambers also ran for the  in  as a  candidate. He petitioned to be included on the  and also ran for , receiving 0.43% of the vote.\n\n\n\nBecause of a legislative resolution Chambers introduced in 1980, Nebraska became the first state to  in protest of . Upon discovering that the University of Nebraska held several hundred gold  as an investment, Chambers introduced a nonbinding resolution calling for reinvestment of state pension funds that had been invested directly or indirectly in South Africa. The resolution argued that apartheid was contrary to .\n\nNebraska's divestment caused little immediate change in business practices;  of  said, \"I'd rather lose business in Nebraska than with South Africa.\" But other state governments and eventually the federal government followed Nebraska's example, contributing to the end of apartheid. Chambers spearheaded a stronger 1984 law mandating divestment, resulting in Nebraska's public employee pension funds divesting $14.6 million in stocks issued by companies that did business with South Africa.  later visited Lincoln, where he remarked that Nebraska had helped to end apartheid. The state government conspicuously did not invite Chambers to Tutu's speaking event.\n\n\n\nChambers filed a lawsuit in 1980 attempting to end the Legislature's practice of beginning its session with a prayer offered by a state-supported chaplain, arguing that it was unconstitutional under the . The  held that the prayer did not violate the Constitution, but that state support for the chaplain did. The  held that both practices violated the Constitution, but in '''' (1983), the  held by a 6–3 vote that both practices were constitutional because of the United States' \"unique history\".\n\n\nChambers has promoted recognizing  student athletes as state employees since the 1980s, arguing that they are generating revenue for their universities without any legal benefits for doing so, which encourages illegal payments and gifts. A bill on this issue was passed by the Legislature but was unable to overcome the governor's veto. After it was revealed that requiring student athletes to be recognized as state employees would jeopardize any university's  standing, the language of the bill was changed so that a university could allow for players to be paid a stipend, after which the bill passed and was signed by the governor in 2003.\n\n\nAccording to '''', unidentified people present at a closed meeting reported that Chambers claimed he heard credible reports of \"boys and girls, some of them from , who had been transported around the country by airplane to provide sexual favors, for which they were rewarded.\"\n\nInvestigating what became known as the , a Nebraska grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations and possibly return indictments. Eventually, the grand jury ruled the entire matter was \"a carefully crafted hoax,\" although they failed to identify the perpetrators of the hoax.\n\ns, saying \"these animals should not be killed for the love of killing.\"]]\n\n\nNebraska's LGBT community has considered Chambers an ally since the 1970s. In 1993, he co-sponsored a bill to prohibit employment discrimination by . The bill faced fierce opposition. Opponents of the anti-discrimination legislation formed a Nebraska chapter of the  and brought activist  to Lincoln to organize antigay rallies outside the Capitol building.\n\nDespite the opposition, Chambers sponsored another LGBT anti-discrimination bill in 1995. He continued to support similar measures throughout his career in the legislature. None of them has been successful.\n\n\nIn April 2006, Chambers introduced legislative bill (LB) 1024, an amendment to a bill that would divide the  district into three different districts. The bill and its amendment were created in response to an effort by the district to \"absorb a string of largely white schools that were within the Omaha city limits but were controlled by suburban or independent districts.\" Omaha Schools claimed that the usurpation was necessary to avoid financial and , but supporters of LB 1024 contested the district's expansion, favoring more localized control. The bill received national attention and some critics called it \"state-sponsored segregation\".\n\nLB 641, passed in 2007, repealed and superseded LB 1024, restoring pre-2006 Omaha-area school district boundaries, after which a \"learning community\" was created to equalize student achievement in  and  counties.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome members of the Nebraska legislature attempted to ban s from Nebraska's court system in 2007. Chambers believed that this attempt was misguided, and that access to the court system should not be restricted. To dramatize his point that the court system must be entirely open, Chambers filed a  in  district court in September 2007. It argued that God has caused \"widespread death, destruction, and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants.\"\n\nNebraska media inaccurately reported that Chambers's lawsuit against God was intended as an ironic protest against frivolous lawsuits. Chambers clarified that, on the contrary, his lawsuit against God \"emphasized that attempts by the Legislature to prohibit the filing of any lawsuit would run afoul of the 's guarantee that the doors to the courthouse must be open to everyone.\"\n\nThe  filed an  in the lawsuit arguing that Chambers did not have  to sue, and that he was \"fully deserving of the outpourings of God's fierce wrath.\" In response, Chambers voiced disagreement with the church but argued that the church's access to the court system must be protected, just like his.\n\nThe lawsuit was dismissed in October 2008 because a summons notifying God of the lawsuit could not be delivered to the defendant, who has no listed address. Chambers countered that, because of God's , God had been notified, but decided not to pursue the suit further.\n\n\nChambers is a firm opponent of the death penalty, and introduced a bill to repeal  at the start of each legislative session, 36 times over 40 years. The bill, LB268, passed the legislature in 1979 but could not overcome Governor 's veto; the issue remained a primary focus of his while in office.\n\nIn 2015, Chambers again introduced LB268. The measure passed the legislature over Governor 's veto. Following the veto, a petition drive was undertaken to reject the bill and maintain capital punishment. Enough signatures were secured to suspend LB268 until the November 2016 general election; in the election, 60% of the votes cast favored rejecting the repeal and keeping the death penalty.\n\n\n\n* Chambers has long advocated on behalf of , who were convicted of the murder of an Omaha police officer; Amnesty International considers them s.\n* Often clashing with fellow senators, Chambers has taken on several issues of concern to rural Nebraskans during his tenure, such as a bill requiring landowners to manage the population of s on their property and a proposed constitutional amendment to preserve the right to fish, trap and hunt in the state. Chambers described the latter measure as one of the most \"asinine, simple-minded pieces of trash\" ever considered by the legislature. In 2004 Chambers co-authored an opinion piece with U.S. Representative  opposing a set of initiatives that would allow casino gambling and slot machines in Nebraska. Chambers also opposed proposed funding of the state's ethanol plant incentive programs, calling them \"a boondoggle\".\n* Chambers has long supported  goals. For example, he argued forcefully in favor of a  in 1975 that made Nebraska the first US state to outlaw marital assault.\n* In 2006, Chambers withdrew support from two tax incentive bills that would have provided funding for Omaha and Lincoln civic building projects. He said he withdrew support because Omaha business leaders had insulted the legislature and the  community he represents by criticizing the passage of LB 1024. He was also insulted by the 's refusal to name a  after him despite that neighborhood's request to do so.\n* In 2015, Chambers introduced LB473, opposing the .\n* In 2016, Chambers filibustered a bill that would have changed Nebraska's  of electoral college vote splitting into a winner-take-all system like that of other US states. Because the vote-splitting method was preserved, one district in Nebraska assigned an electoral college vote to  in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\n* On November 4, 2008, Chambers was elected to the new  and  Counties' Learning Community Board; he was sworn in during 2009.\n* Chambers hosted a weekly call-in  cable TV show on Omaha's Community Telecast, Inc. (CTI22), broadcast on Cox Channel 22.\n* In 2014, after ending his regular '''' column, Chambers said he was going to write a blog.\n* Chambers distributes \"Erniegrams\" to other legislators that consist of typed  and commentary about recent events and legislative topics in the current session, as well as photocopied articles and political cartoons of note, which are sometimes posted by other legislators on  as Chambers does not use computers.\n\n\n\nIn 2000, a term-limit amendment was passed that essentially forced Chambersand half of Nebraska's state senatorsout of office in 2008. The amendment required legislators sit out one term, after which they could run for election. In 2012, Chambers was once again elected to represent north Omaha's 11th district in the Nebraska Unicameral, defeating  by 3,408 votes, with 10,336 votes cast. He was forced to sit out the 2020 election due to the same law.\n\n\nOn March 20, 2015, during a Judiciary Committee hearing on allowing guns in bars (LB 635), Chambers said, \"My  is the police.\" He said his comments were intended to criticize the failure to prosecute Alvin Lugod, the Omaha police officer who fatally shot Danny Elrod on February 23. Although fellow senators did not react to his comments during the hearing, there was backlash. Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer responded, \"The comments that Senator Ernie Chambers made today at the Nebraska Unicameral are not only reprehensible but are completely without merit.\" Omaha Mayor  also criticized Chambers, saying in a press release that he should be looking for ways to improve public safety instead of \"comparing police officers to terrorists.\"\n\nGovernor  called Chambers's comments \"irresponsible\" and asked for an apology. Stothert, Police Chief Todd Schmaderer, and Nebraska Attorney General  were also critical, and the hashtag #supportblue was organized in response to Chambers's comments. Senator  of  called for his resignation.\n\nSenator  of Omaha said he regretted that he had not immediately protested the remark. Several other senators disagreed with Chambers's opinion but defended his right to express it. Senator  of  remarked, \"It's a wonderful opportunity to pile onto Senator Chambers.\" Chambers said he would continue to be vocal in his criticism of the police and would not apologize.\n\n\nOn November 8, 2016, Chambers was reelected to the legislature, defeating his opponent, John Sciara, by a vote of 7,763 to 1,726. In January 2017, Sciara filled a protest challenge to the legislature, claiming Chambers did not live in the district he was elected to represent and was thus ineligible to hold office. Chambers denied the allegation, calling it \"busybody, gossipy, vengeful cud that already has been chewed.\" On April 20, 2017, Nebraska state senators voted 42-0 to dismiss Sciara's challenge, following the recommendation of a special legislative committee formed to evaluate the claim.\n\n\n\n\nChambers is a longtime  activist and the most prominent and outspoken  in the state. He has been called \"the Maverick of Omaha\" and the \"angriest black man in Nebraska\", and has called himself a \"Defender of the Downtrodden\".\n\nIn the 1990s, the apartment complex  was renamed Ernie Chambers Court. In 2008, a room at the  used for Judiciary Committee meetings was named the Ernie Chambers Memorial Hearing Room.\n\n\n\nThe  awarded Chambers a plaque naming him a \"Hero of the First Amendment\" at their annual convention in 2005 in .\n\nChambers was offered a Distinguished Service award from the  in 2007, but he turned it down. He accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award from the association in 2016 at its 75th anniversary conference in .\n\n\nAside from serving in the , Chambers has lived in Nebraska all his life.

Karger noticed discrepancies between the $2,078 worth of non-monetary contributions that the LDS Church had reported and all the activities that the church had undertaken to pass Proposition 8. Roman Porter, the executive director of the FPPC, announced a full investigation later that month. The investigation examined the church's involvement in providing phone banks, a website and commercials for Proposition 8, ultimately finding the church guilty of 13 violations, which the LDS Church settled by paying a fine.

NOM had contributed $1.6 million to Stand For Marriage Maine, as of October 23, 2009, without revealing its donors' names.  Karger has repeatedly called for a Congressional Investigation of the National Organization for Marriage due to its late and non-reporting of its federal 990 income tax returns.\n\n\nIn the 1990s Karger worked for the tobacco industry to prevent smoking bans in California.\n\n\nIn 2011, Karger encouraged Republicans to boycott   in protest of the Florida Republican Party's decision to reschedule its presidential primary to January, which upsets the normal primary calendar.\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She stated she planned on \"...using clear communication and teamwork in order get things done,\" should she be elected. In her announcement, she did not comment on Leitzell's proposal regarding campaign spending. A.J. Wagner, a local judge, has also announced his intention to run.\n\nOn January 17, 2013, Leitzell was interviewed at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington D.C. where he was asked about how he felt about the proposal on gun control measures by U.S. president . Leitzell owns a gun himself, but stated \"I think it should have been done awhile ago. I believe people should have guns but I also think there are certain guns that certain people don’t need to have.”\n\nIn February 2013, it was reported that neither Whaley nor Wagner had chosen to follow Leitzell's suggestion regarding campaign spending. Leitzell stated \"Dayton would have been on the national map, media-wise, for doing something so innovative, so creative and so necessary at this moment in time with regard to campaign spending. From my perspective, it was more to do with marketing. It wasn’t to do with winning or losing.\"\n\nOn February 27, 2013, Leitzell participated in a candidates night presentation with five other candidates for mayor, including Whaley and Wagner, as well as three other new names: Derek Foley, Eric Lamont Gregory and Darshawn Romine. His response to the issue of how gun violence could be limited was that he supports the right to bear arms, but suggested that people be required to pay more for access to assault rifles or high-capacity magazines. During the panel, Leitzell pointed out Dayton successes, referring to recent reports of Dayton being \"the most affordable city, the happiest city and the third-best city for employment opportunities.\" In the week leading up to the panel, Nan Waley had conducted a telephone push poll that had angered Leitzell and Wagner regarding \"questions they felt misrepresented facts about their past.\" The poll implied that Leitzell was a racist and that Wagner was corrupt.\n\nOn March 13, 2013, it was announced that Leitzell, Whaley and Wagner were the only candidates who had secured the required signatures to earn a spot on the ballot. As the final election for mayor is between two candidates, a runoff was held on May 7, 2013, with the top-two vote getters advancing to the final election in November.\n\nLeitzell was interviewed by Dayton, Ohio radio station  as part of a series of interviews with the candidates in the 2013 primary. Leitzell reiterated his promise regarding campaign spending, discussed those issues which are important to him, and challenges faced by the city. He also fielded a question regarding those who have criticized him for his \"part-time\" approach to the job of mayor, noting that the role is defined in the city charter as part-time and that he uses social media to respond to questions, but does not carry a cell phone.\n\nLeitzell lost the runoff election, with Whaley securing over 50% of the votes (4,965) and Wagner coming in second with 2,566 votes to Leitzell's 2,338. As such, Leitzell did not appear on the ballot in the November 2013 election and left office at the end of 2013. Leitzell blamed his loss on a lack of understanding by the voters regarding the primary process, but expressed no regrets and pleasure at receiving 23% of the vote, despite spending only $2,000 on campaigning, as opposed to his opponents' respective totals of $264,000 and $100,000. On January 14, 2014, he announced on his blog \"This Old Crack House\" that he would return to his pastime of renovating his house, a formerly derelict building he had bought in a troubled neighborhood in 2001.\n\nIn July 2013, Leitzell pulled petitions to run as an independent for a position on the  commission. In order to get on the November ballot Leitzell was required to get 1852 valid signatures from registered voters on a petition. Party candidates were required to obtain just 50 signatures. Neither party candidate for the commission seat was opposed in the 2014 primary election. Leitzell submitted some 2900 signatures by the required date, May 5, 2014. He was certified by the Board of Elections as a candidate on May 19, 2014. The final results being that Leitzell came in third place with 9.83% of the vote.\nIn 2015, Leitzell pulled petitions to run for Montgomery County Commission again but this time as a Republican candidate. He would only be required to get 50 valid signatures of Republican or undeclared voters in order to get on the ballot instead of 1492 if he ran as an Independent. He turned in petitions to run against incumbent Judy Dodge as did Don Birdsall, Robert Matthews and Charlotte Mcquire. Realizing that Debbie Lieberman could run unopposed, he withdrew his petition and went out to gather some 100 more signatures and resubmitted a new petition for the other seat. Don Birdsall did the same thing. Don Birdsall was endorsed by the Montgomery County Republican Party and the Ohio Buckeye Firearms association. Leitzell claimed no endorsements. In March 2016 Leitzell won the contested primary with 31444 votes over Birdsall's 29986 votes. Robert Matthews beat the party endorsed candidate as well. Leitzell was the Republican party nominee for Montgomery County Commissioner but was not endorsed by Montgomery County GOP, and did not win this election. With the retirement of Nan Whaley, Leitzell is running again for mayor of Dayton for 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She won two consecutive four-year terms as the city's  in 2006 and 2010. After reaching the mayoral , she was reelected to the City Council in 2014. In June 2017, she announced her candidacy for  in the .\n\nMcLaughlin's election in 2006 made Richmond the largest U.S. city led by a Green Party member. She has advocated for a  increase and a plan to forcibly appropriate foreclosed s from banks. She has led an ongoing effort to restrict the municipal influence of Richmond's largest employer, the , and to refashion its environmental obligations.\n\n\nMcLaughlin was born into a  family in . The middle child of five daughters, her father was a  carpenter and her mother was a factory worker and housewife.\n\nDuring the 1980s, McLaughlin was an activist with the  solidarity movement and a steering committee member of  (Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador). She also played an active role in the North Star Network, a national networking effort to unite progressives, and in coalition-building efforts with . She continues to work as a social activist in the , , , and  movements.\n\nMcLaughlin earned a Bachelor of Science degree in  from  and took graduate courses in psychology and education at  and . \n\n\nShe has worked as a postal clerk, teacher, caregiver for the elderly, and tutor/clinician for children with . She has also worked in the capacity of support staff for various  health and educational organizations. She has lived in Richmond since 2001.\n\n\nMcLaughlin is a founder of the  (RPA), a non-partisan progressive group in western , composed of members of the , , and the , as well as independent voters. In 2004, the RPA ran a slate of candidates to replace a municipal government that was widely seen as dysfunctional: \"There are vacancies in virtually every major administrative department,\" wrote the '''', \"and the city is operating with an interim city manager, city attorney, police chief and fire chief. The city has no library director and no parks and recreation director, and no one running its housing authority.\" Together with RPA colleagues, McLaughlin won her first election to the Richmond City Council in November 2004.\n\nIn Richmond, McLaughlin's  has found her involved in many local struggles in support of both social and . She opposed the , the criminalization of the homeless, and Chevron's Richmond Refinery tax perks. She has also been involved in an ongoing effort to stop development on the  shoreline and supports the .\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, McLaughlin decided to challenge Richmond's incumbent mayor . She was elected on November 7, 2006 by a 242-vote margin over Anderson. At the time, her victory made Richmond the largest city in the country with a Green Party mayor. McLaughlin won a second term in office in the 2010 municipal election. She overcame a well-funded offensive to unseat her during the re-election campaign.\n\nUnder McLaughlin's mayoralty, the \"small, blue-collar city best known for its  refinery has become the unlikely vanguard for anticorporate, left-wing activism\". From early in her career, McLaughlin gave tangible governmental support to workers' s as a means of fighting unemployment. She was a strong proponent of , a proposed municipal  that was met by determined, well-funded resistance from the  and other business interests. She also spearheaded a 2014 effort to raise Richmond's local  to US$12.30 per hour. The raise provided impetus to the broader statewide minimum wage movement. McLaughlin was a member of the nationwide advocacy group .\n\nMcLaughlin was criticized for attending an  on  of 2011 instead of a symbolic ship-launching portrayal at the former . McLaughlin stated she was a supporter of  and .\n\n\nThe  of the late 2000s had a powerful impact on Richmond. Even by 2013, nearly half of all home mortgages in the city were \"underwater\", with owners owing more than their houses were worth.  On average, homeowners with mortgages were indebted for about 45% more than the original value of their homes.  McLaughlin mounted a unique and highly controversial effort to gain control of the mortgages. The city, in partnership with a private financing company, would seek to purchase mortgages from banks at  and then allow the homeowners to refinance for a minimal fee. If the banks refused, the city would seize the mortgages using the legal power of .\n\nDefending the plan, McLaughlin said mortgage seizures were necessary to alleviate \"an unjust set of circumstances\" facing homeowners after the , and the use of eminent domain would be justified for the common good by preventing  caused by abandoned foreclosed homes. The city thus has a right and duty to prevent foreclosures, as well as a legal necessity to protect its citizens: \"People were tricked. They were sold these bad loans\" which were far in excess of their value, and made Richmond \"a community being victimized\". In March 2013, the City Council voted 6–1 in favor of partnering with a San Francisco firm, Mortgage Resolution Partners (MRP), to begin enactment of the plan.\n\nOpponents in Richmond countered that the plan would help only a small subsection of mortgage-holders, while two banks,  and , immediately filed lawsuits against the city. Arguing that it was an illegal use of eminent domain, the banks also warned that it would severely damage the U.S. mortgage industry by encouraging other municipalities to do the same. Other cities, including , , and  were all said to be considering mortgage seizure, although only Richmond publicly pursued the plan. Undaunted, McLaughlin told the press in August 2013 that her administration was confident that it would prevail in court against the banks. The following month, after heated public debate, the City Council again voted to back McLaughlin and proceed with the plan.\n\n\nMcLaughlin had a contentious relationship with the  during her political career. The multinational energy corporation maintains a massive, century-old oil , and it has long dominated the city's economy and politics. After the RPA took root, however, the shift in government caused friction with Chevron, particularly after the McLaughlin administration fought it in court over the payment of various taxes. A major fire at the refinery in August 2012 led to another hotly contested lawsuit, this time for \"willful and conscious disregard of public safety\".\n\nChevron spent $1.2 million in 2012 to oppose two Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA) City Council candidates who were critical of the company and to support three that the oil company considered supportive. That was the one year that the RPA candidates lost. McLaughlin herself was not up for reelection that year, but strongly supported the two RPA candidates with whom she shared progressive values.\n\n\nEven after her mayoralty ended, Chevron continued to oppose her vigorously, \"spending some $3 million – an unheard of amount for a small, local election – to campaign against McLaughlin and her slate\" in the . She was nonetheless elected to the City Council in 2014 and served in this role until July 18, 2017, when she resigned to seek a higher political office.\n\nMcLaughlin is not without critics such as the '''', which referred to her and the RPA in a 2016 editorial as \"the biggest deniers of the city's fiscal crisis.\"\n\nShe and her fellow RPA candidates Eduardo Martinez and  all won by wide margins in 2014 despite having been heavily outspent by their opposition. The 2016 City Council elections were noticeably quieter in tone, with no financial input from Chevron, according to campaign finance reports. Two other RPA candidates, Melvin Willis and Ben Choi, won open seats creating a RPA majority in the City Council.\n\nIn 2016, McLaughlin changed her political party registration from Green Party to NPP (\"No Party Preference\") so she could vote for U.S. Senator  in the California presidential primary.\n\n\nIn June 2017, McLaughlin declared her candidacy for  in the . Her independent campaign refused to accept any corporate contributions.\n\nAlthough McLaughlin ran with no party affiliation, her endorsements include the , the Peninsula chapter of the , the , , the , the , and the .\n\nThe hotly contested primary race saw over $10 million raised by campaigns, \"far more than the $7.6 million that candidates raised for the entire election cycle the last time the seat was open in 2010\". In a crowded field of eight, McLaughlin won 263,364 votes (4.0%).\n\n\nA chronicle of the McLaughlin administration's rise and legacy, ''Refinery Town: Big Oil, Big Money, and the Remaking of an American City'', was published in 2017 with a foreword written by Bernie Sanders. This was followed in early 2018 by McLaughlin's own memoir, ''Winning Richmond: How a Progressive Alliance Won City Hall''.\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n* \n*  (2013) in ''''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He had run for the seat in 2020 but was defeated by incumbent  Rep. . Suozzi opted against seeking re-election in 2022, and Santos ran for Congress again. That time, Santos prevailed, defeating Democrat Robert Zimmerman. Santos, who is gay, was the first  to be openly  before being elected to Congress.\n\nWithin six weeks of Santos's election, news outlets began reporting that much of his biography appeared to be fabricated. Santos admitted to having lied about his education and employment history, while his disclosures about his business activities, income, and personal wealth were inconsistent with one another. Further, Santos had not disclosed his criminal history or the existence of lawsuits against him. Santos was sworn in as a member of the House in January 2023, but faced ongoing media scrutiny as well as demands for his resignation from members of both parties.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, following an investigation by the  and a federal , the House of Representatives voted 311–114 to expel Santos.

Three of his four maternal great-grandparents were also born in Brazil, with the other born in Belgium. Fátima Devolder immigrated to Florida as a migrant worker to pick beans in 1985. She later moved to New York City and was a housekeeper, cook, and nanny.}} Gercino Santos was a house painter. Santos has claimed  in the U.S. and Brazil.}} In 2013, a Brazilian court described him as American.\n\nSantos has said his family was poor during his childhood, living in a rat-infested basement apartment in , near a Brazilian immigrant enclave in . Relatives and friends recall that his parents and an aunt often bought him dolls, toys, and clothes despite their lack of money. His parents' marriage appears to have ended by 1998, when records in Gercino's native state of  show that he remarried there. Santos remained close to his mother (living with her intermittently until her death) and maintained infrequent contact with his father. According to a biographer, Santos developed a reputation within his family for deceit and theft during his childhood.\n*Fátima responded with \"Oh God, Anthony and his stories\" when asked to confirm one of them by a former roommate of Santos, after which she advised her interlocutor not to believe George's accounts of his past.\n*He reportedly kept money his aunt gave him to pay some of her bills; she did not find out until she received notice that they were overdue (She has never spoken on the record about her nephew).\n*On two separate occasions, including one where he stopped someone from taking a bag of his own important papers at George's behest, Gercino advised people to be careful regarding their dealings with him.}}\n\nSantos holds a . He attended Intermediate School 125 (also known as I.S. 125 Thomas J. McCann Woodside Intermediate School) in , and Primary School 122 (also known as P.S.122 The Mamie Fay School) in Astoria.\n\n\nAround 2008, George moved to  in Brazil's , where his mother, Fátima, was then living, and lived there until 2011, although acquaintances of Santos from that period are unsure whether he lived in Brazil or merely visited. Many knew him as Anthony Devolder. Fátima lived in difficult circumstances, working odd jobs, moving around frequently due to unpaid rent, and obtaining electricity illegally. Santos told people his family had money because his father was a high-paid executive in New York.\n\nA friend from that time says Santos was very involved in local , handing out leaflets and regularly attending meetings of a local activist group and  parades.}} Two former acquaintances said that he competed as a  in Brazilian beauty pageants in 2008 using the drag name Kitara Ravache,}} with one saying that Santos began dressing in drag in 2005. Manoel Antiqueira, who performs in drag as Eula Rochard, recalls Santos returning from a 2007 trip to the U.S. with expensive materials for a dress that were not available in Brazil at the time.\n* The Brazilian news program '''' published a video purportedly of Santos dancing in drag at Niterói's 2007 gay parade; ''Fantástico'' cited digital crimes expert Wanderson Castilho confirming that this person was Santos.\n* A Wikipedia user called \"Anthonydevolder\" (one of Santos's aliases) wrote about himself on the site in 2011, giving Santos's birth date, describing a similar family background, stating that at 17, he had been a drag queen in a gay nightclub and had won several gay beauty pageants, and identifying three supposed television and movie acting credits.}}\nSantos denied having been a drag queen, calling the allegations \"categorically false\" and accusing the media of making \"outrageous claims about my life\"; two days later, he said, \"No, I was not a drag queen in Brazil, guys. I was young and I had fun at a festival.\"\n\nWhile in Brazil, Santos's politics were shaped by his family's generally strong support for right-wing politician , who later became Brazil's . Santos supported Bolsonaro despite his . The Santoses frequently disparaged Brazil's then-president, , on social media. After winning his House election, Santos posted a picture of himself with Bolsonaro's equally conservative ally .\n\n\nFrom October 2011 to July 2012, Santos worked as a customer service representative at a call center for  in . Hired for his second-language skills, he handled calls from Portuguese-speaking customers.\n\n'''' verified that sometime after 2013, Santos worked for HotelsPro, a subsidiary of -headquartered MetGlobal. In early 2016, Santos moved to Orlando, Florida, where HotelsPro was opening an office. He registered to vote and changed his driver's license to his Florida residence.\n\nSantos has worked for LinkBridge Investors, a company that states that it \"connects investors with fund managers\". His 2019 campaign disclosure form and a company document list him as a vice president, but that same year, the company president testified in a lawsuit that Santos was a freelancer who worked on commission. A press release for the company referred to him as its New York regional director.\n\n\nIn January 2020, shortly after launching his first campaign for Congress in November 2019, Santos began working for Harbor City Capital, a Florida-based  firm. The  later filed a civil suit accusing the company of running a $17million . In June 2020, during his first run for Congress, Santos (under the name George Devolder) opened an office for Harbor City Capital in  and became the firm's New York regional director.}} He was not named in the lawsuit, and he has denied knowledge of the fraud. In 2020, Santos claimed to be managing $1.5 billion in funds for Harbor City, with a fixed  of 12 percent and an  of 26 percent. An investor said Santos called him after the SEC suit was filed, crying that he had lost a million dollars of his own money as a result. Harbor City paid Santos at least through April 2021, but , a New York financier, said Santos told him he had been let go before that due to conflicts with his political activities.\n\n\nAround the time he is reported to have left Harbor City Capital, Santos founded a  (LLC) called the Devolder Organization, and his reported personal income rose substantially. The company had no public presence when major media investigations commenced, and Santos has given inconsistent explanations of its business.\n\nAccording to his financial disclosures, Santos was the sole owner and managing member, managing $80 million in assets. On financial disclosure forms, Santos called the organization a \" consulting\" firm. Although based in New York, the company was registered in Florida, where it was dissolved in September 2022 for failing to file annual reports. Santos said that its accountant had missed the annual filing deadline. In 2022, the organization lent Santos's congressional campaign more than $700,000. Santos reported receiving a salary of $750,000 and dividends of $1–$5 million from the company, even though he also claimed that its estimated value was in the same range.\n\nDespite his claims about the organization's size, Santos's financial disclosure forms listed no clients. In July 2022,  estimated Devolder's revenue at less than $50,000. Santos listed himself as the  for the LLC and listed Florida as his state of residence. The company's mailing address was a  apartment owned by Harbor City's .\n\nThe House Ethics Committee's investigation found that Santos incorporated the LLC in May 2021, although he reported income from it on his 2020 income tax return. The committee found that when Santos applied for a business account in May 2021, he told the bank that the organization made $800,000 in net profit every year and grossed $1.5M; his May 2022 campaign financial disclosure said that the company's assets were in the $1M to $1.5M range. The organization's 2021 financial statements showed $614 of income and over $14,000 of expenses, amounting to a loss exceeding $13,000, and at the time Santos filed the 2022 disclosure, there was $4 in the company bank account.}} The committee said that both Santos' personal and business accounts were used for a series of \"significant\" cash deposits followed by prompt cash withdrawals of similar amounts, and the source of the cash was unclear. The unexplained cash withdrawals amounted to over $240,000.\n\n\n\nSantos was president of United for Trump, a small New York-based group supporting 's . In July 2019, the group staged a counter-protest to an anti-Trump rally in , which led to shouting and a fistfight.\n\n\n\n\n\nSantos ran as a Republican for the  in , against Democratic incumbent , launching his campaign in November 2019. Normally, the Nassau County Republican Committee, known for the tight control that its leadership exercises over often competitive races for its nominations, would have discouraged an unknown candidate with such minimal experience. However, Suozzi was expected to win the race easily, and no other candidates had put their names forward. Santos raised funds, spoke to donor groups, and attended a phone-banking session at  with Donald Trump's children; his efforts impressed party officials. He bought entire tables at New York  events. Other candidates making the same rounds noticed that Santos repeatedly exaggerated his fundraising totals, with a wide contrast between what he said and what he reported in his campaign finance disclosure forms.\n\nSuozzi later recalled that he had no doubt he would defeat Santos, an unknown who was not well-funded and who at the time was registered to vote in an area of Queens that was outside the district. When reporters pressed him about living outside the district, Santos claimed an address that turned out to be his campaign treasurer's. Because Santos was so little-known in the district, the Suozzi campaign decided not to pay for opposition research, deciding that it would be counterproductive to increase his name recognition. As expected, Suozzi prevailed; he defeated Santos 56.0%-43.5% (a margin of about 46,000 votes). Despite Santos's loss, local Republicans were pleasantly surprised by his performance.\n\n\nSantos refused to accept his 2020 defeat and falsely claimed that the vote totals had been manipulated. He began raising money and hiring additional staff for a recount, insisting that half the Democratic ballots should have been discarded. Santos also refused to leave the orientation session for new members of Congress even after his opponent's victory was certified.\n\nSantos spoke at a \"\" rally the day before the , telling the crowd that the election he lost by 13 percentage points in 2020 was stolen from him. On January 6, he attended Trump's  rally at  in Washington, D.C. He later said that Trump \"was energized\", gave \"a great speech\", and was \"at his full awesomeness\" that day. After the speech, a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, disrupting the  that formalized Trump's loss in the . Santos later said he was \"never on Capitol grounds\" on January 6, called it a \"sad and dark day\", and acknowledged that  won the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\n\nShortly after his loss to Suozzi, Santos formed GADS PAC, a , and began raising money to run for Congress again. Then-New York state Republican chair  noted that \"George never stopped being a candidate\" and was \"spending time at Mar-a-Lago, raising money in different circles\". U.S. representative  endorsed him in August 2021 and helped him raise over $100,000 at a fundraiser.\n\nSome Republicans had reservations about Santos. In mid-2021, one of his former advisors uncovered questionable business practices at Harbor City, but was unable to get press coverage. Late in the year, Santos's campaign commissioned a vulnerability study, which revealed significant issues. Some staff members advised him to drop out; instead, he dismissed the concerns and refused to show his diplomas, leading several staffers to resign. Those who stayed became increasingly concerned and asked him to seek professional help.\n\nDespite internal concerns, Santos continued his campaign, donating $185,000 to the county Republican committee, which endorsed him. Suozzi announced he would not seek reelection to Congress in November 2021, improving Republicans' chances of winning the seat. Unopposed for the Republican nomination, Santos ran against Democrat Robert Zimmerman. Zimmerman's campaign had access to a lengthy opposition research file but chose to focus on voter outreach instead.\n\nIn September 2022, '''' raised questions about Santos's employment, financial disclosures, and claims of wealth, but other media outlets did not report on the matter until after the election.million two years later. [...] no one followed its story before Election Day. |archive-date=December 29, 2022}} Santos defeated Zimmerman by 8%, flipping the district and helping Republicans retake the House. After his victory, numerous outlets reported that much of Santos's  appeared fabricated. Santos admitted to lying about his education and employment history, while his financial disclosures were inconsistent.\n\n\n\nThe Santos campaign announced in April 2023 that he would seek reelection in 2024. The state's  and Republican Party chairs said they would not support Santos.\n\nFollowing the failure of an October 2023 vote to expel him from the House, Santos said he would run again in 2024 even if he was expelled from the House before the election. In November 2023, after the House Ethics Committee's report made further fraud allegations against Santos, he reversed course and announced that he would not seek re-election.\n\nDuring the  in March, Santos announced that he would run for the House in , challenging incumbent Republican , who had long advocated for Santos's expulsion or resignation. Santos called LaLota a . \"[T]o hold a pathological liar who stole an election accountable,\" LaLota responded, \"I led the charge to expel George Santos. If finishing the job requires beating him in a primary, count me in.\"\n\nOn March 22, 2024, Santos announced his departure from the Republican Party, stating that he, \"in good conscience, cannot affiliate myself with a party that stands for nothing and falls for everything.\" He intended to continue his congressional campaign as an . On April 23, 2024, Santos dropped out of the race.\n\n\n\nOn January 11, only eight days after the start of his tenure, four Republican New York congressmen who had also been elected in 2022, , , and called for Santos to resign. The other two freshman Republican members of Congress from New York,  and , followed suit. Joseph Cairo, the chair of the Nassau County Republican Party, also called for Santos to resign, saying that he had \"disgraced the House of Representatives, and we do not consider him one of our congresspeople\".\n\nSantos refused to resign, and kept the support of Republican House leadership, including former House speaker , House majority leader , and Representative  (the fourth-highest-ranking House Republican), who relied in part on Santos's vote to support their very narrow (four-seat) House majority. McCarthy did not deny Santos committee assignments or impose any penalty on him for the misrepresentations he made during his campaign. Santos was assigned to the committees on  and . On January 31 (two weeks after the assignments were announced), he announced at a meeting of House Republicans that he was vacating his committee memberships, but said the move was temporary, however he never rejoined.\n\nIn February 2023, Santos co-sponsored a bill to designate the \"\" the National Gun of the United States.\n\nIn 2023, Santos voted in favor of the key bills supported by the House Republican leadership. After his indictment in May, House Republican leadership reiterated that they would not seek to force Santos to resign or expel him from the House. A subsequent attempt by Democrats to force a vote on an expulsion resolution was blocked and referred to the .\n\nLater in 2023, House Democrats announced they would introduce a resolution to  Santos. Unlike an expulsion, the measure would need only a simple majority to pass. Democrats said that Republicans, who had informally criticized Santos, should have no problem with a censure vote. Five New York Republicans who had already called on Santos to resignLaLota, Molinaro, D'Esposito, Langworthy and Lawlersaid they would vote for censure, as did Ohio Republican .\n\n'''' reported in July 2023 that Santos's office lagged behind those of members from neighboring districts in handling constituent service requests.\n\nSantos was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the  in the House.\n\nIn October, Santos voted to keep McCarthy as speaker when eight Republicans joined with House Democrats to . He refused to support  as McCarthy's replacement, since the Louisiana congressman had not personally sought Santos's support.\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2023, after Santos was indicted on federal charges,  and other House Democrats introduced a  to expel Santos from the House, which required a two-thirds vote, or 290 votes, in favor. Because an expulsion motion is , the Republican House leadership was required to either schedule a vote within two s, table the proposal or refer it to the Ethics Committee. They introduced a motion to send the resolution to the Ethics Committee. The House approved the motion by 221–204 along party lines; seven Democrats voted \"present\". After Santos was indicted on additional charges in October, D'Esposito introduced a second expulsion resolution, cosponsored by the other five Republican House freshmen from New York. After Rep.  was elected speaker, the sponsors moved to force a floor vote on the resolution.\n\nOn November 1, the expulsion motion failed 213–179, with 19 voting present. Support was mostly from Democrats, joined by 24 Republicans, while 31 Democrats joined Republicans in opposing. California representative , one of those 31, believed that it was wrong to expel Santos before his case had been disposed in the courts or the House Ethics Commission had issued its report. Santos said the result was a victory for  and dismissed the resolution as a political stunt by his colleagues anxious about their re-election prospects in 2024.\n\nIn the wake of the Ethics Committee's report on Santos two weeks later, Garcia announced he would introduce another expulsion resolution, with the expectation that it would be voted on after the  recess. It was seen as possible that some of the representatives who had voted against expelling Santos previously would reconsider their positions in the wake of the report. One, Maryland Democrat , said he would vote to expel, as \"[t]he report's findings are extremely damning\".\n\nRep. , chair of the Ethics Committee, introduced an expulsion resolution of his own after the report was released. Over the holiday recess, Santos said on an  that he expected to be expelled the following week when Congress returned. He said he would \"wear it like a badge of honor\", called Guest a \"pussy\" and said that no one from  was going to push a New Yorker out of Congress. Santos said it was hypocritical of the House to expel him.\n\nOn December 1, the House voted to pass Guest's resolution to expel Santos, 311–114. Specifically, 206 Democrats and 105 Republicans voted for the resolution, with two Democrats and 112 Republicans voting against his expulsion. Ten representatives did not vote, with two voting present and the rest absent. He is the sixth member of the House to be expelled, the only Republican, and the only member expelled without first being convicted of a federal crime or having supported the .\n\nAfter Suozzi won the  to fill Santos's seat, leaving the House Republicans with an even narrower majority, Santos lashed out at his former Republican colleagues who had voted to expel him in a group text. \"I hope you guys are happy with this dismal performance and the 10 million dollars your futile Bull Shit cost the party,\" Santos wrote. \"I look very much forward to seeing most of you lose due to your absolute hate filled campaign to remove me from Congress arbitrarily.\"\n\n\nPolitically, Santos has aligned himself with former president Donald Trump. At a March 2019 event held by the conservative  that encouraged members of the  to leave the , Santos (introducing himself as Anthony Devolder) claimed to have formed a group called United for Trump and asked , a  YouTuber, how she could \"help educate other trans people from not having to follow the narrative that the media and the Democrats put forward\". In 2023, Santos attended a rally of supporters outside the Manhattan courthouse where  on felony charges of .\n\nSantos has called  a \"made-up concept\". In a 2022 speech to the Whitestone Republican Club in , Santos called  \"barbaric\" and compared it to .\n\nAfter the , Santos said, \"I think every inch of the United States at this point should be mapped out again and completely checked. I don't care if we go into a  for a couple of months.\"\n\n\nOn December 19, 2022, after Santos had been elected to Congress but before he had taken office, '''' reported that he had lied about many aspects of his biography. His lawyer denied the allegations. On December 22, New York attorney general  announced that an investigation had been opened into Santos.\n\nOn December 26, Santos broke his silence with interviews on  and with ''''. He denied being a criminal, saying, \"I'm not a fraud. I'm not a criminal who defrauded the entire country and made up this fictional character and ran for Congress\". Santos admitted to the ''Post'' that he had lied about graduating from college and working for  and . By December 28, federal prosecutors for the Eastern District of New York were investigating Santos's finances, and the Nassau County district attorney was investigating him.\n\n\n\nSantos was raised as a Catholic and has identified himself as a Catholic. At various points in his career, however, he has claimed to be \"Jewish\"; \"Jew-''ish''\"; \"half Jewish\"; a ; \"a proud \"; and a \"\".\n\nIn a January 2020 appearance on ''Talking GOP'', a cable TV show he co-hosted, Santos claimed his maternal grandfather grew up Jewish, converted to Catholicism before the Holocaust, and raised his children Catholic. While Santos said that he was Catholic and that he was not \"trying to claim Jewish heritage\", he added, \"I believe we are all Jewish, at the end – because Jesus Christ is Jewish. And if you believe in Jesus, and we're all brothers in Christ, I mean\". The video resurfaced in early 2023. More specifically, Santos has claimed that his maternal grandparents were  who fled  and German-occupied Belgium.\n\nOn an October 2020 radio show, Santos claimed that Democratic former congressman  offered him his support during an event hosted by the Council for a Secure America, a bipartisan group co-chaired by Israel. Santos claimed that Israel told him: \"You're going to be the first Republican I am voting for in my life.\" Israel denied saying anything of the kind, and Santos did not appear on the event's guest list. Santos did not otherwise make much mention of his purported Jewish ancestry during his 2020 run, but referred to it frequently in 2022 when all the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to replace Suozzi were Jewish.\n\nAt a meeting at the U.S.–Israel PAC a month before his 2022 election, Santos courted pro-Israel activists by falsely claiming to be \"\", according to attendees. A co-chair of the organization said this served to give the impression that Santos's mother was Jewish, getting \"a chuckle out of the crowd\".\n\nSantos's former roommate said Santos frequently made antisemitic jokes and said that it was acceptable for him to do so because he was Jewish. The former roommate corroborated a claim that Santos previously joked online about  killing Jews and Blacks.\n\nOn December 21, 2022, following Santos's November 2022 election to Congress, '''' and '''' reported that Santos's claims about his family's alleged Jewish heritage were false. His maternal grandparents were born in , not in Ukraine or Belgium.\n\nDuring a December 26, 2022 interview, Santos said: \"I never claimed to be Jewish. I am . Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was 'Jew-ish'\". On December 27, 2022, the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) asserted that Santos would no longer be welcome at RJC events because he had \"'deceived' the organization and 'misrepresented' his Jewish heritage\".\n\nIn 2023 media appearances, Santos claimed that his claim to Jewish ancestry was vindicated by  kits; however, he did not reveal the DNA information. Santos said on a May 2023 podcast that he was raised Catholic but considered himself a \"member of the tribe\" because his mother's ancestry was predominantly Jewish. Santos said he had many Jewish friends among his constituents and went to  dinners \"more often than most\". Six months later, he promised CNN's  that he was still working on getting proof of his grandparents' ancestry, but that he was experiencing difficulty due to the ongoing .}} In November 2023, Santos reportedly said that he was \"finishing getting the last pieces\" of evidence that his grandparents, after emigrating to Brazil, had forged documents that enabled them to \"blend in and all of that\".\n\nIn 2020, Santos claimed that he was biracial and that his Brazilian-born father had n roots. ''Jewish Insider'' could not confirm this information.\n\n\nOn his campaign website, Santos wrote that his mother was \"the first female executive at a major financial institution\", worked in the , and died \"a few years later\" after surviving the . On her 2003 visa application, however, his mother stated that she had not been in the country since 1999; in June 2001, Fatima reported that she was living in Brazil. Her actual occupation has been described as  or  nurse.\n\nUpon the death of Santos's mother, a Brazilian newspaper described her as a cook. Santos's former roommates and friends said she spoke no English. In July 2021, Santos wrote that \"9/11 claimed my  life\". In an October 2021 interview, he said his mother was \"caught up in the ash cloud\" during 9/11 but \"never applied for relief\" because the family could afford the medical bills. In December 2022, he claimed that his parents survived being \"down there\" at the World Trade Center during 9/11. A priest at the family's Catholic church reported that when Santos's mother died in 2016, Santos told him that the family could not afford a funeral. The priest recalled that a collection at a  raised a \"significant\" amount for the family, which he gave to Santos. He also had a friend set up a . In November 2023, '''' reported that the funeral home never received the $6,000 it was owed for its services.\n\nIn his February 2023  interview, Santos insisted his mother had been at the World Trade Center the day of the attack. \"It's quite insensitive to try to rehash my mother's legacy\", he said. \"She wasn't one to mislead me ... I stay convinced that's the truth\".\n\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, Santos said that as a child, he attended the , an elite  in , before withdrawing because of family hardship. After the school denied those claims, Santos asserted that he had attended Horace Mann for only six months in ninth grade and suggested that he had used one of his other names. The school reiterated that it had no record of a student at the time using any variation of Santos's name. Santos's biographer wrote that although Santos has retracted claims about his higher education, he remained adamant about having attended Horace Mann despite the complete absence of evidence supporting this claim.\n\nSantos falsely claimed to hold a  in finance and economics from  and to have graduated near the top of his class. His claimed period of attendance overlapped with his time in Brazil. Santos's friends recall times when he claimed to be taking classes at Baruch but never seemed to study. In January 2023, Santos falsely told a Republican Party chairman that he had been a \"star player\" on the Baruch volleyball team (as his LinkBridge supervisor had been), having won the league championship and defeated . At the time in question, Yale had no men's varsity volleyball team. In a pre-election radio interview, Santos said his supposed volleyball career led to him needing both . Santos later admitted that he had never graduated from college.\n\nCampaign documents claimed that Santos held a  (MBA) from  (NYU) and that he had scored a 710 on the  (GMAT). In a 2020 podcast, Santos claimed to have paid off his MBA student loans by 2020. A prospective Harbor City investor recalled Santos telling him he had turned down an offer to attend . Gregory Morey-Parker, a roommate who lent Santos money in 2014 that has not been repaid, recalled that Santos claimed to be a graduate of  but seemed not to know its name.\n\nIn his interview with Morgan, Santos said that he lied about his college experience to meet perceived societal expectations. He added that he could not afford to attend college. Santos said he did not know the source of the spurious GMAT score in his résumé published by the Nassau County Republican Committee. Morgan asked why Santos thought he could get away with lying about his education in a congressional election, and Santos replied that no one had raised any questions about his claims during his 2020 campaign. In a February 2023 '''' interview, Santos blamed his résumé lies on the local Republican Party; later, after expulsion from the House, he said that a campaign staffer had written his résumé.\n\n\nSantos has used various aliases, including \"Anthony Zabrovsky\" and \"Anthony Devolder\". A 2011 Wikipedia userpage created under the latter name claims that the account holder had acted in '''' and ''''.\n\nAfter returning to the U.S. from Brazil, Santos told friends that he had worked as a journalist for Brazilian media conglomerate . ''The New York Times'' could not find his name on the organization's website. Santos also told a roommate in late 2013 that he was a model who had worked at  and would be appearing in ''''.\n\nSantos has called himself a \"seasoned Wall Street financier and investor\" and said he had worked for  and , but neither company has any record of him. His campaign website stated that he was \"an associate asset manager in the real asset division\" of Citigroup, but the company sold its  division in 2005, before his claimed period of employment. On a 2022 podcast, Santos claimed that while employed at Goldman Sachs seven years earlier, he had attended the ; while there, he had allegedly criticized the company for investing in , calling it a taxpayer-subsidized scam. , who runs the conference, said there is no record that Santos ever attended.\n\nSantos worked as a customer service representative at a call center for  in  from October 2011 to July 2012, overlapping the time he said he worked at Citigroup. He later told the '''' that his Citigroup claim was \"a poor choice of words\" and that a subsequent employer had been in \"limited partnerships\" with those companies. Acquaintances and coworkers said that Santos claimed his family was wealthy and had extensive real estate holdings in the U.S. and Brazil. He repeated this claim during his 2022 congressional campaign, saying that he and his family owned 13 rental properties in New York. No such properties were listed on his campaign's financial disclosure forms or in public records. Santos later admitted to the ''Post'' that the claim was false and that he owned no properties as of the end of 2022.\n\nIn a November 2022 interview, Santos discussed the 2016  that took place in Orlando, saying that his company \"lost four employees\" there. ''The New York Times'' found no connection between the 49 victims killed in the attack and any company named in Santos's biography. In a December 2022 interview, Santos changed his story, saying, \"We did lose four people that were going to be coming to work for the company that I was starting up in Orlando\".\n\nDuring his 2022 congressional campaign, Santos told prospective donors that he was a producer for the musical ''''. Michael Cohl, ''Spider-Man'''s lead producer, denied that Santos was involved with the show. The musical's playbills did not contain his name. Santos was living in Brazil in 2011 when the show opened, and his alleged time as producer overlaps his employment at Dish Network.\n\nIn August 2023, Santos downplayed the significance of the many false or exaggerated claims he had made related to his job history, saying that he had not posted his résumé online during his campaign. He also noted that \"studies show that most people lie on their résumés. It's just unfortunately ... the reality\".\n\n\nDuring his 2020 campaign, Santos gave his address a residence in , , located outside the district in which he was then seeking office. Santos and his partner later moved to a  in ; its owner said they had moved there in July 2020. In March 2022, Santos told '''' that he left Whitestone because of an alleged January 2021 vandalism incident. He was registered to vote at the Whitestone address during his congressional campaigns, but did not appear to live there.\n\nSantos's landlord said he moved out of the Whitestone residence in August 2022, leaving $17,000 in damages, but records showed he was still registered there when he voted that November. According to the landlord, Santos continued receiving mail there after the election, including the certificate of his election victory. Santos told reporters he planned to move to , , but he and his partner apparently moved into a house in ,  (outside the boundaries of the 3rd ) in August 2022. He told the ''Post'' the house was his sister's, but ''The New York Times'' later found she lived in Elmhurst.\n\n\nOn at least three occasions, Santos has claimed to have been the victim of various s. In January 2016, he claimed to have been robbed of the money he was on his way to give his former landlady's attorney in settlement of her eviction claim against him. Five years later, Santos claimed he and his partner had found stones and eggs thrown at their Whitestone apartment after they returned to it from a party at . The owner, who lived in the building's lower unit, did not recall any such incident; the ''Times'' found no relevant police report.\n\nAfter his election, Santos told two Brazilian journalists on a podcast that during mid-2021, he had been mugged in New York City as he walked out of a building at the corner of  and  in mid-afternoon. Thieves, he said, made off with his briefcase, watch, and shoes, and fled the scene before anyone noticed anything. '''' noted that the intersection in question is one of the busiest in the city with high security at its luxury businesses. Santos did not provide a police report of the incident. His description of the alleged assault included a comment that has been characterized as an \"overtly racist\" stereotype about Black people being likely to commit crimes.\n\nIn October 2023, Santos told the ''Times'' that a few months earlier, his niece had vanished from a Queens playground, only to be found 40 minutes later in the company of two Chinese men. He claimed to suspect that the incident was retaliation for his opposition to the . The newspaper found that while the incident had been reported to police, investigators found no evidence to support the story and suspected it had been invented.\n\n\nIn addition to his claim in October 2020 of having both knees replaced, Santos said in an interview earlier that year that he had been diagnosed with a  and received . He also claims to suffer from an  and . When asked in 2022, his campaign did not give details or answer questions about his purported brain tumor.\n\n\nIn his 2020 campaign online biography, Santos claimed he and his family had worked charitably on behalf of children born with the rare genetic skin disorder  (EB). '''' found that no one involved with the few charities that specifically work with EB patients in the U.S. or Brazil had ever heard of or received contributions from him. Sometime during 2022, the campaign changed the website so it no longer mentioned EB; the revised language said that his family's charitable efforts were directed at \"helping at-risk children and America's veterans\".\n\n\nDuring Santos's 2020 campaign, a consultant described him as \"a walking campaign-finance violation.\" Santos suggested that donors bypass contribution limits by donating to other Republicans' PACs, which would then send the money back to him.\n\n\nIn September 2023, Santos filed his personal financial disclosures 20 months late.}} In 2020, he reported a net worth of $5,000 and only $50,000 from Harbor City Capital, but the House Ethics Committee later reported over $90,000 in income and exposed $80,000 in mostly fictitious loans to his campaign. He personally profited $28,000 from repayments of those loans. By 2022, he claimed a net worth of $2.5 to $11 million but reported no U.S. property, despite earlier claims of owning Long Island mansions. A $600,000 loan to his campaign was missing from his 2022 forms, but later bank records showed $715,000 in loans from his personal savings and Devolder accounts. The committee suggested these loans may have been illegal campaign contributions.\n\nIn March 2023, Santos reportedly brokered a $19 million yacht sale between two major campaign contributors. Although not illegal, the transaction's timing raised concerns about potential campaign finance violations. Authorities are investigating. His campaign in July 2023 reported raising $133,000 but refunded $85,000 to him. Many donors were linked to Chinese billionaire , whom Santos has publicly supported. By April 2024, Santos’s 2022 campaign reported no fundraising or spending, but its debt had increased to nearly $800,000, with $630,000 in loans claimed to be from Santos personally. Four months later, the campaign reported a similar amount of outstanding debt against $562 in cash on hand.\n\n\nDuring his campaign, Santos spent prodigiously; he used campaign funds to pay for shirts for staff from , meals at the restaurant at the , and $40,000 in airline fares, including to locations in California, Texas and Florida, and a stay at  in , part of $30,000 in hotel bills, $14,000 paid to car services, and an equivalent sum spent at a Queens restaurant. That much airfare, the ''Times'' later noted, is far more than most candidates spend on their first election and closer to the amounts spent by party leaders who have served in Congress for years. Two campaign aides told the ''Times'' that staff were increasingly concerned during the campaign that Santos was more interested in spending the $3million raised for the race \"frivolously\" than on winning the election. The October 2023 indictment suggests that at least $11,000 in spending on luxury items was money obtained through  and , by Santos allegedly using donors' credit card information without their knowledge or consent, representing himself as them, and diverting those funds to a company he controlled.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee found several instances of apparent personal spending during and after the campaign that were not reported to the FEC. In February 2022, he had spent $1,700 at two Atlantic City casinos, $1,500 at a pet store, and smaller amounts on , various retailers and the  amusement park in  on Long Island. A July hotel bill in excess of $3,000 ''was'' reported, but conflicts with Santos's personal calendar showing he was elsewhere at the time and not doing any campaigning. Charges for a taxi and hotel in Las Vegas were made to the campaign during a time when Santos said he was there for his . At the end of November, following his election victory, Santos's campaign wired him $20,000, which also went unrecorded. He spent $6,000 of it at , withdrew $1,000 in cash from a Queens ATM and, later, $800 at a casino. Other money was used to pay his rent.\n\nSantos's campaign finance reports listed a company called \"Cleaner 123\" as receiving $11,000 over four months in rent for campaign staff housing in the district. Neighbors of the house said that Santos and his partner appeared to have been living there during that time.\n\nSantos continued to spend campaign money lavishly even after being expelled from the House. His FEC filing for the last quarter of 2023 reports a $1,300 expense at the Capitol Hill Club, a private Republican social club, on December 4, three days after his expulsion.\n\n\nSantos's campaign and GADS PAC reported making a combined $180,000 in contributions to other Republican campaigns. A review by the ''Times'' of those other campaigns' financial reports found many instances where their reports and Santos's reports did not match.\n\nThe PAC reported making two $2,900 donations to Michelle Bond's unsuccessful primary campaign for the Republican nomination in the neighboring . Her campaign's reports show a single donation of $5,000, $800 less than Santos's PAC reported. The PAC's donations to 's unsuccessful  are acknowledged by the recipient, but a subsequent $2,000 from Santos's campaign committee is not, and the Masters campaign says it can find no records of it. The address Santos's campaign gave for that contribution, like some of the donations Santos reported, was apparently fictitious, this one in the .\n\nThis pattern also extended to Republican candidates for state office. Disclosure reports for those campaigns on file with the  in  show over 20 donations to them from Santos's campaign and his PACs during the 2020–22 election cycle. There are no corresponding reports of those donations on Santos's and GADS PAC's FEC filings.\n\n'''' later looked at Santos's 2020 campaign finance reports, and found similar discrepancies in both state and federal reports. Shortly after being formed in 2019, Santos's campaign committee made its first donations, $9,000 total, to Trump's presidential campaign committee and two local Republican organizations. The first, at $2,800, is not reported in the Trump campaign's filings and exceeds the cycle limit for contributions from one campaign to another. The second is to the \" Republican Club\", a nonexistent entity. The New York state records of two Republican organizations that do use the town's name show no contributions from Santos. Similarly, a $2,000 contribution to the Nassau County Republican Committee is not reflected on that organization's records. \"It's impossible to believe that all three of these political committees independently lost track of political donations from Santos's campaign during this period\", a campaign finance lawyer the website spoke to said.\n\nIn April 2023, Texas representative  reported that her campaign had never received its share of a joint fundraising committee (JFC) created for a fundraiser held with Santos in July 2022. In a report filed by its treasurer, Nancy Marks, the JFC reported raising $11,600. Around $2,000 was spent on the event, at a , restaurant; the rest was, according to the report, divided evenly between the two campaigns, with each receiving almost $5,000. A spokesman for the Van Duyne campaign said that money was never disbursed to them and that it will not hold further fundraisers with Santos through it. Santos's campaign had no comment.\n\nCampaign finance lawyer Brett Kappel speculated that the failure to share the money might indicate that Santos's campaign was using the JFC to evade campaign contribution limits. He noted that two contributors gave a combined $5,800 to it in August, equal to the amount they had already contributed directly, the legal maximum, to Santos's campaign. There could be more innocent explanations, Kappel allowed, such as the check getting lost in the mail, but in that case, the campaign treasurers should have long ago resolved that. He also noted that although Santos's campaign treasurers had both filed termination reports with respect to the JFC earlier in 2023, the FEC had not obliged by mid-April, suggesting that the JFC may be the subject of complaints to the commission.\n\n\nIn a later article, the ''Times'' noted that Santos's campaign spent more than $5,000 on flights to and hotel stays in Washington and , for Republican fundraisers in the first quarter of 2021, a time when the next congressional election was almost two years away and he had no primary challenger. By the end of the year, Santos's reported expenses for those trips had reached $90,000 and had become more lavish, with hundreds of dollars spent on transportation, hotels, and food around the country.\n\nIn early 2022, the campaign filed amended reports. Among the changes made were upward adjustments to some of the expenses he had reported at the end of 2021. A $60 meal at a Michigan  restaurant was now reported as having cost $199.99, along with three additional expenses of that exact amount on that date. Five previously reported  and taxi rides went from $267 total to $445. A subsequent amended report, in May, reported no transactions on the date to which the sushi dinner had previously been attributed.\n\nSantos's campaign financial disclosures went on to include many other expenses of $199.99one cent below the $200 threshold at which campaigns are legally required to provide receipts and disclose recipients. An election law expert the ''Times'' talked to suggested that this could indicate awareness of the law and intent to violate it.}} One of those expenses was for a Miami hotel where rooms rarely rent for under $600 a night. The ''Times'' later reported that other Miami businesses where the campaign reported spending money could not find receipts for those amounts or said the expenses did not reflect the prices of the products allegedly purchased.\n\n'''' later compared Santos's campaign reports to other congressional campaigns that spent similar total amounts, and found that only nine percent of them had recorded ''any'' expenses in the $199–200 range. Most of those were to the videoconferencing service , which offers a business plan for $199.90. Of 4,300 campaigns that filed reports during the cycle, only 25 reported any expenses of exactly $199.99; of those, the most times that amount was claimed was four, while Santos's campaign claimed it 37 times. ''Politico'' called this \"a statistical improbability\".\n\nThe ''Times'' noted that the $199.99 transactions reached a total of 1,200 separate payments in Santos's early 2022 amended report, totaling over $250,000. They were still in the amended report from May of that year, which had removed the larger sushi-dinner bill and taxi expenditures. By the end of the campaign, the total unitemized expenditures had exceeded $365,000, 12 percent of his total campaign expenses and six times that of any other member of Congress from New York. Since federal election regulations require that campaigns itemize all transactions with a particular vendor once the amount exceeds $200, the ''Times'' calculated that Santos's campaign would have to have done business with over 1,800 separate concerns for all the unitemized transactions to be lawfully reported as such. His campaign lists 270. An expert at the  (CLC) said the campaign's reporting was \"so ludicrous that it's completely wrong\" and suggested the campaign was covering up its actual expenses.\n\nSantos suggested in a subsequent interview that the recurrences of \"$199.99\" could have been clerical errors that could be \"rectified if there is any discrepancy.\"\n\n\n\nDuring his two congressional runs in 2020 and 2022, Santos reported having spent over $25,000 at Il Bacco, an eatery popular for New York City Republican events; he had also entertained prospective Harbor City clients there. Santos's 2022 campaign reports owing Il Bacco nearly $19,000 for its election night victory party, in addition to seven of the instances where the campaign had reported spending exactly $199.99.\n\nSantos appointed Il Bacco's owner, Giuseppe \"Joe\" Oppedisano,*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* along with his daughter, the restaurant's manager, to his campaign's \"Small Business for Santos\" Coalition; Oppedisano in turn donated $6,500 to his campaign and its associated PACs. Oppedisano's brother Rocco also gave Santos's campaign $500. Because Rocco is not a U.S. citizen and his  was revoked after guns and drugs were seized from his properties in 2009, he cannot legally make campaign contributions.\n\n\nIn July 2021, Santos loaned GADS PAC $25,000, five times what it had on hand at the time. The next day, the PAC donated the same amount to the campaign of , a Republican congressman from Long Island who became the party's gubernatorial nominee in 2022. Starting in April 2022, GADS PAC, by then flush with donations from Santos supporters, repaid him in four installments over two months. Santos had effectively arranged for his campaign contributors to repay the loan. At the time these were reported, Robert Maguire, an expert on the subject at  (CREW), found several aspects of the transaction \"extremely strange\", including Santos's loan to a PAC (rather than his campaign committee, as is more typical) and his establishment of a  for himself before even being elected to Congress (such PACs are used by party leaders and committee chairs or s, to support colleagues).\n\nThe House Ethics Committee examined Santos's and GADS PAC's bank records and found neither the 2021 loan nor one for $2,000 supposedly made to it by Santos a year later. Similarly, none of the $30,000 in repayments to Santos were actually made. Almost half that money was given to another New York political committee; neither it nor GADS PAC reported the transaction to the FEC.\n\n\nDuring 2021–22, the  (FEC) wrote over 20 letters to Santos's campaign about problems with its disclosure reports. Fourteen concerned contributors exceeding the $2,900 per cycle limit and insufficient information on the terms of loans to the campaign. Some original reports also unlawfully described contributions as coming from anonymous donors. The campaign responded with amended reports, ultimately filing 36 in total for the 10 periods in which reports were required.\n\nIn December 2022, the FEC wrote to Marks, then Santos's campaign treasurer, about the same problems, as well as other potential violations, including contributions from apparent political organizations not registered with the commission and insufficient disclosures regarding other contributions, such as the 48-hour notice required for contributions of more than $1,000 during the last 20 days before the election. The campaign had until January 24, 2023, to correct those violations. Santos's attorney denied any unlawful spending of campaign funds.\n\nIn January 2023, the CLC filed a complaint with the FEC, alleging that Santos used campaign funds for personal expenses, concealed the source of $700,000 he gave his campaign, and falsified expenditures.  (ECU) filed separate complaints with the FEC, DOJ, and . Another non-profit advocacy group, Accountable.US, filed an additional FEC complaint by the end of the week, alleging over $100,000 in contributions over the limit.\n\nOn January 24, the campaign filed amended reports with the FEC, unchecking boxes that said two loans, including $750,000, had come from Santos's personal funds without explaining who did lend the money. Other loans were still marked as coming from Santos. Campaign finance experts noted the unusual number of amended reports filed. In February, Santos said the money came from his own finances.\n\nOn January 27, it was reported that the  asked the FEC to suspend its probe while federal prosecutors conducted a parallel criminal investigation. Five House members requested the  to investigate potential violations of campaign law and the .\n\nAt the end of January, ECU filed another FEC complaint against the Santos campaign, pointing to $260,000 raised as a recount fund, despite New York not allowing candidates to request recounts. Expenses appeared to duplicate those reported before the election. Santos denied involvement in the FEC filings.\n\nIn February, the FEC informed Santos that his campaign had raised more than $5,000 without debts, deeming him a candidate in the . The FEC gave him until March 14 to declare candidacy; Santos filed a statement confirming his candidacy.\n\n\nThe campaign's January 2023 reports listed Thomas Datwyler as treasurer, but he denied involvement, saying his name was forged. The FEC asked the campaign for clarification.\n\nIn February, the FEC gave Santos's campaign until March 14 to name a new treasurer or face suspension. A week later, the campaign hired Andrew Olson, but his address matched Santos’s, and no one knew him. Olson had no prior campaign experience and listed no phone number.\n\nIn May 2023, after his indictment, Santos filed new FEC paperwork listing himself as treasurer. A day later, he hired Jason D. Boles, previously a treasurer for . CREW filed another FEC complaint, alleging that Olson was fictitious.\n\nWhen Santos filed new paperwork after announcing his 2024 candidacy, Boles was listed as treasurer.\n\n\n'''' found in late January 2023 that many contributions to Santos's 2020 campaign were from fictitious or nonexistent names and addresses, all given through , an online processor of small-donor contributions for Republicans. Twelve donations, totaling $30,000 of the $338,000 Santos reported raising from individual contributors, were from real people who denied having donated the amount claimed. Nine of those donors were among the 45 listed as having given Santos the maximum allowed under law for both the primary and general cycles. The magazine later found that relatives of Santos in Queens who had been reported to have given his campaign over $45,000 denied having made those donations; one said he could not have afforded the amount.\n\nAs part of its investigation into $365,000 in unitemized campaign expenditures, the ''Times'' found some Santos donors who said they were reported to have given more than the legal limit and more than their own records showed, sometimes in ways that suggested an attempt to make the contributions appear legal. One donor said the $20,000 the campaign reported he gave ($7,000 more than his records showed in contributions to Santos and related organizations) was in 24 separate transactions, all of which used his former address but different versions of his name, and incorrectly claimed he had a spouse.\n\nFederal prosecutors later said Marks had told them she made up contributions from members of Santos's family and hers in 2021 so the campaign could appear to have raised more than $250,000 from third parties in the third quarter of that year. By doing so the campaign qualified for financial and logistical assistance from the  (RNC). Those numbers also helped dissuade other candidates from entering the race for the nomination. Shortly after Marks's guilty plea Santos was indicted on charges related to the scheme.\n\n\n''TPM'' reported that a contributor to Santos's 2020 campaign had discovered unauthorized charges totaling nearly $15,000 on their credit card, made through WinRed during 2021 and 2022. Despite the contributor's decision not to continue supporting Santos, these charges were recorded, some exceeding cycle limits. WinRed, accused of enrolling donors in unauthorized recurring contributions, initially failed to find a record of these transactions but eventually refunded $2,000. The full refund was later provided by American Express.\n\nIn 2021, the donor's card was also used for unauthorized contributions to Tina Forte, totaling $2,900 each, which they had never authorized. Another donor to Forte found a $5,800 charge on their card, far exceeding their intended donation. After complaints, refunds were issued.\n\nIn July 2023, Forte's campaign manager suspected Red Strategies USA, partly owned by Santos, of inflating WinRed's fees in reports. For example, $35,000 in \"credit card fees\" was reported when WinRed typically charges only 4%, suggesting an excessive amount given the campaign's fundraising. NBC News found similar discrepancies in Santos's campaign's use of WinRed, with $206,000 paid to WinRed instead of the expected $33,000, leaving $173,000 unaccounted for.\n\nThe October 2023 superseding indictment accused Santos of a scheme involving unauthorized use of donor credit cards, leading to charges of aggravated identity theft and credit card fraud. Santos's consultant, Sam Miele, later admitted to unauthorized use of donor credit cards and lying about campaign expenditures, including defrauding one donor of $470,000.\n\nIn a letter, Republican Max Miller alleged that Santos had used his and his mother's credit cards for unauthorized contributions, calling Santos a \"crook\" on the House floor. He claimed that over 400 others, including Republican members, were similarly defrauded. Santos's final campaign finance report listed a $16,000 debt to WinRed, despite no previous disclosure of transactions with the platform.\n\n\nSantos's campaign paid $50,000 in fees to Miele, who had called Republican donors falsely claiming to be then-House speaker Kevin McCarthy's chief of staff and asking them to support Santos. In mid-January 2023, McCarthy said though he had \"some questions about it\", he had \"no idea\" about the falsity of Santos's résumé when he ran, nor that Miele had posed as McCarthy's chief of staff, Dan Meyer. Some contributors to the Santos campaign said they were motivated to give to him because of his supposed Wall Street experience or his claim to be Jewish, both later found to be fictitious, and felt cheated in the wake of those disclosures. Following an August indictment on charges of wire fraud, identity theft, and money laundering, Miele pleaded guilty in November to one count of wire fraud; his lawyer would not say whether he had agreed to testify against Santos.\n\n\nRedStone Strategies, a  supporting Santos in the race that had told potential donors a month before the election that it had raised $800,000 and was seeking to raise another $700,000, did not register with the FEC as a campaign organization. It was thus not known who donated to RedStone or ran it; the Devolder Organization and Jayson Benoit, one of Santos's former Harbor City coworkers who lived at and owned the Merritt Island address, were listed as officers of a similarly named organization in Florida records. There is no record that RedStone spent any money on advertising in support of Santos. It also described itself as a  organization, which means that while it could spend on political advocacy as long as that was not its primary purpose, it could not support candidates directly.\n\nRedStone received $110,000 in a series of 76 payments over 2021 from Tina Forte's campaign, whose treasurer was the same former Harbor City coworker of Santos's and a co-owner of RedStone along with Marks and the Devolder Organization. Forte's campaign's FEC reports have some issues as well, such as many unnamed donors and $14,000 in reimbursements to the candidate for unnamed personal expenses, along with the allegations from donors of unauthorized credit charges via WinRed.\n\nDemauro, Forte's campaign manager, said that Santos recommended that they hire the similarly-named Red Strategies USA as a consultant in 2021 without disclosing that he had an interest in the firm, and even seemed to have pretended to be meeting its principals, former Harbor Hill associates, for the first time along with Demauro. The agreement between the campaign and Red Strategies called for the firm to keep 80 percent of any funds it raised, an amount Demauro believes the campaign was trying to obfuscate with its initially inflated statements of WinRed credit card fees. She recalls that Marks, the campaign treasurer, repeatedly ignored her requests for bank and account statements; her own paychecks were frequently late.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee reported that a witness identified as working for the Forte campaign}} confronted Santos in December 2021 about his failure to disclose his interest in Red Strategies. The witness noted that Santos's name was on the incorporation papers filed in May (it was actually the Devolder Organization). Santos responded that he had merely bought into the company in August.\n\nRedStone Strategies was formed in November 2021 following complaints from the Forte campaign about Red Strategies. Santos represented himself as its \"managing partner\" while signing one contract with another vendor; he also used a RedStone email address in his capital introduction work. During 2022 RedStone paid Santos at least $200,000;}} an October payment of $50,000 was used by Santos over the next month to spend over $4,000 at , pay for some  subscriptions and pay his rent and credit card debts.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, Marks pleaded guilty in a federal court in Long Island to numerous campaign finance violations. Her plea agreement recommended she serve between 42 months to four years in federal prison. Santos was indicted five days later on charges of  related to the diversion of funds to RedStone under the pretense that it was to buy television advertising when in fact none of it was, or could have been.\n\n\nIn late 2020, after Santos had lost the election to Suozzi, Marks and Tiffany Santos established a PAC called Rise NY, which paid RedStone $6,000 in April 2022. It later raised money from many Santos donors who had exceeded the $2,900 limit for direct campaign contributions. PACs are allowed to make unlimited contributions to candidates and parties, but cannot coordinate efforts with campaigns. Rise NY's Twitter account posted accounts of voter registration events and rallies it claimed to have organized during the campaign; Rise NY reported paying salaries to some Santos campaign staff, $10,000 to a company Marks runs, and a $20,000 salary to Tiffany Santos. It also reported multiple expenditures at Il Bacco, the Queens Italian restaurant where Santos's 2022 campaign spent $14,000, and at a gas station near Santos's Whitestone apartment.}} ''Newsday'' reported later that, for two months in 2021, Rise made Santos's $2,600 rent payments, and it later paid $1,800 for three tickets for Santos and two guests to attend a gala sponsored by the Liberty Education Forum, a group the PAC gave over $50,000. It also reported $6,500 in payments to Santos.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee, in reviewing bank records for Rise, RedStone and Santos's businesses, found \"numerous unreported transfers to and from the campaign bank account\" during 2022. Some went to other accounts under Marks's control, $10,000 to the Devolder Organization, and $50,000 went between Rise and the campaign, in amounts exceeding $20,000 at one point.\n\n, the financier who had lost most of the $625,000 Santos persuaded him to invest in Harbor City, said his $175,000 contribution to Rise NY was underreported to the state by $95,000 until a later amended report. Later, he learned that his contributions had amounted to 40 percent of the organization's funding. A $25,000 donation he made to RedStone Strategies, purportedly for a large television ad buy, was never reported to the FEC because RedStone had never registered with it.\n\n'''' reported at the end of February 2023 that despite no official connection to Rise, Santos regularly solicited contributions to it and in some cases personally delivered checks from it, including two for $62,500 each to the Nassau County and Town of Hempstead Republican committees, suggesting that he had some role with Rise. Another witness the committee interviewed recalled having concerns about Santos's involvement with Rise while a candidate and even the entity's legality.}} In late 2021, over $55,000 Santos raised with the promise of registering voters was instead diverted to Outspoken Middle East, an LGBTQ news platform aimed at that region of the world.\n\nOutspoken founder Charles Moran said he had approached Santos asking for financial help; since the contribution was legal for Rise to have made, he accepted it. Former ambassador  was also involved with starting Outspoken; he spoke at a Santos fundraiser around the same time and formally endorsed Santos in July 2022. Intrater told ''Mother Jones'' that he had only learned from them about the diversion and that Santos had told him repeatedly during 2021 that contributions to Rise were being spent to build the Republican Party in New York.\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2023,  and , House Democrats from New York, filed an ethics complaint with the  over Santos's financial disclosure reports. In March, the House Ethics Committee announced a formal inquiry and created a subcommittee to investigate allegations of having failed to provide proper financial disclosures to the House, sexual misconduct, and conflict of interest.\n\nIn June, the committee announced that it was expanding its investigation to cover the unemployment fraud alleged in the May 2023 federal indictment of Santos. It announced that it had sought the voluntary cooperation of about 40 witnesses and subpoenaed 30 others.\n\nTwo months later, Rep.  of Maryland, the most senior Democrat in the House and a former member of the party's leadership, wrote the Ethics Committee asking they make public whatever they had found so far about Santos. \"More than enough time has passed for the [committee] to conduct a fair and accurate assessment of the veracity of the allegations against Rep. Santos and of the scope of his misconduct\", he said.\n\nOn November 16, the Ethics Committee released its Investigative Subcommittee's report, accusing Santos of fraud similar to what he had already been criminally charged with, such as diverting campaign funds for personal use, as well as money raised for RedStone Strategies that donors were told would be used on campaigns. The subcommittee listed some of those personal purposes, including over $4,000 to , plastic surgery and , payments of personal credit card bills and other debts, travel to  and  that had no campaign purpose, and a small amount on  subscriptions. In a news release accompanying the report, the committee said \"[it]s investigation revealed a complex web of unlawful activity involving Representative Santos's campaign, personal, and business finances ... [He] sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.\" It believed \"there was substantial evidence that Representative Santos violated federal criminal laws, some of which are the subject of the pending charges filed against him in court.\" Santos subsequently announced he would not run for reelection, although he would remain in Congress for the rest of his term. He called the report \"a disgusting politicized smear that shows the depths of how low our federal government has sunk.\"\n\n\nAfter obtaining his high school equivalency diploma, Santos spent time in Brazil. In 2008, he forged checks, stolen from a man his mother was caring for, to buy 1,313 (about US$700) worth of clothing. He gave his name as Délio. When writing the checks, Santos presented identification bearing his photo but the check owner's name. The store owner became suspicious when the signatures on two checks did not match. A few days later, another young man came in to return a pair of shoes that Délio had bought; the store clerk, who had had to cover the loss, traced Santos through the man's  profile. Santos later admitted to the theft in a message to the clerk and confessed to police before he was charged with  in 2010. The case was archived by a Brazilian court in 2013 because authorities there were unable to locate Santos.\n\nIn January 2023,  prosecutors announced that they would revive the fraud charges since they knew where Santos was. In March 2023, prosecutors announced a  with Santos, and in May 2023, Santos formally settled the bad check charges; under the agreement, agreeing to pay 24,000  (almost US$5,000), with most compensating the defrauded salesman and the remainder donated to charity.\n\n\nSantos was evicted from rented Queens properties (in Jackson Heights, Whitestone, and ) three times in the mid-2010s over unpaid rent. A onetime roommate described moving into the first apartment in December 2013 after befriending Santos; it had only two bedrooms and one bathroom, and Santos shared it with his mother, sister, and later his boyfriend. Morey-Parker recalls that eviction notices were sent monthly, that new roommates rapidly cycled through the apartment, and that Santos's personal finances fluctuated wildly: \"[He] would go to bars with rolls of hundred dollar bills and, three days later, he would have no money.\" Santos was locked out of the apartment in the summer of 2014 and told the housing court that he needed access to the apartment to feed pet fish, which a former roommate later said had never existed.\n\nSantos signed a lease on an apartment in Whitestone in 2014. In 2023, Pedro Vilarva, who had been Santos's boyfriend at the time, told the ''Times'' that Santos claimed he was expecting money from his investment work at , so Vilarva paid most of the bills, but Santos \"never ever actually went to work\". The relationship soured in early 2015 when Vilarva stopped believing Santos's promises, and after Vilarva came to believe Santos had taken his cell phone to pawn it, he discovered the 2013 Brazilian charges against Santos and moved out.\n\nSantos remained in the apartment through November of that year, owing a month and a half's rent. His landlady filed for eviction, and he agreed to leave by December 24 and pay her $2,250 in back rent, telling the court that his mother's illness had hindered his ability to work but he would soon be able to repay the money from \"business loans\". In mid-January 2016, he told Queens Housing Court that he was mugged on his way to make the payment, but police were unable to take a report at the time, telling him to return later. The  (NYPD) has no record of the incident.\n\nIn October 2015, a  judge ordered Santos to pay Peter Hamilton $5,000 plus interest to repay a loan Hamilton made to Santos in September 2014 for moving expenses. In December 2022, Hamilton told ''The Times'' that the judgment had not been paid.\n\nIn his third known eviction case, a Queens court entered a civil judgment of $12,208 against him in 2017. In housing court, he said he would seek emergency rental assistance. Santos told the ''Post'' that his mother's illness had forced his family into debt at the time; as of December 2022 he had yet to pay the rent he owed, saying he \"completely forgot about it\".\n\n\nSantos claimed to have  over 2,500 animals as founder and operator of a charity called Friends of Pets United (FOPU) from 2013 to 2018. FOPU activities are poorly documented, and in 2022, ''The Times'' found little evidence of its existence other than a closed Facebook account; former volunteers and associates described it as disorganized and said that far fewer animals were saved. FOPU held fundraising events and donated money to other rescue groups, but several recipients said they received significantly less than what Santos promised. Santos told many people that FOPU was a legitimate charity, but it never received  tax-exempt status from the IRS, was not registered as a charity with the state of New York, and never registered with the  as required of animal rescue groups from September 2017. The contractor providing animal-related services to New York City said that it never dealt with FOPU, and the group was not authorized to take dogs from city shelters. Santos said in February 2023 that he \"never handled the finances\" of FOPU, although its volunteers and groups that dealt with FOPU said that he seemed to be the only person who did so. All mentions of FOPU were removed from Santos's official biographies as his other claims began to be widely questioned by the media. Santos's biographer described FOPU primarily as a vehicle for selling puppies from Santos's personal  and those he obtained from commercial breeders, and as a means for Santos to conduct unaccountable fundraising in the name of other, better known rescue groups.\n\n\nIn November 2017, Santos was charged with theft by deception in , after bad checks were written to an  dog breeder from his account. Days after he gave the breeder a $15,125 check for \"puppies\", Santos and FOPU hosted an adoption event at a pet store. After the check bounced, the Pennsylvania charge was brought against him. Tiffany Bogosian, a school friend of Santos's from Queens, assisted in getting the charges dropped after he told her that his checkbook had been stolen in 2017 and he had received an  warrant from Pennsylvania at his New York address in 2020. She successfully argued that the signatures on the checks were not Santos's, and the case against Santos was dismissed in May 2021, after Santos ultimately paid the farmer who lodged the police report. Santos's record was  in November 2021.\n\nIn February 2023, '''' reported that three other Amish dog breeders allegedly were never paid by Santos but never filed police reports.\n\n\n\nIn January 2023, retired U.S. Navy veteran Richard Osthoff and retired police officer Michael Boll accused Santos of having stolen funds that were donated to a  fundraiser. In May 2016, Osthoff was homeless and was told that surgery to remove a life-threatening stomach tumor from his  would cost $3,000. A  recommended that he contact the owner of FOPU, Anthony Devolder, one of Santos's aliases, who then set up a GoFundMe page. After the fundraiser had reached its goal of $3,000 in June, Santos closed it and withdrew the money. Osthoff, Boll, and GoFundMe received no funds, and the dog died in January 2017. GoFundMe banned Santos, who had organized the fundraiser, at the end of 2016. Santos denied swindling Osthoff; in October 2023 he denied even knowing him to the ''Times'', which reported having text messages suggesting otherwise. The FBI is investigating Osthoff's allegations.\n\nThe veterinary technician who had recommended Santos to Osthoff said that Santos later offered to raise funds to repair her farm in New Jersey so that it could be used for . FOPU held a 2017 fundraiser event, charging $50 per attendee, eventually raising $2,165, with Santos controlling the money. The veterinary technician said that Santos was elusive and never gave her any of the proceeds, instead only giving excuses for not transferring the money.\n\nThe owner of a  pet store told the ''Times'' that, after a successful series of fundraisers, Santos, known as Anthony Devolder to the store owner, asked the owner to make the check out to him personally rather than FOPU. The owner refused but later saw that on the payee line of the canceled check, \"FOPU\" had been crossed out and replaced with \"Anthony Devolder\".\n\nA pet rescue operator in  told the ''Times'' that after Santos had boasted of his Wall Street experience and connections to her to assure her he could raise thousands of dollars for her organization, he held a fundraiser in March 2017 and then sent her a check for $400. She stopped working with him, believing he was either overpromising or skimming.\n\n\nCBS has reported that Santos's name came up in a 2017 international  scheme perpetrated by Brazilians in . After Gustavo Ribeiro Trelha, a Brazilian living in , was arrested using a card skimmer at an automatic teller machine, a search of his car found an empty FedEx box with the return address written being one of Santos's former residences in , which Trelha was later reported to have jointly leased with Santos, the same one given on a Florida traffic ticket issued to Santos in October 2016. CBS later reported that two  agents interviewed Santos in New York; he voluntarily surrendered two of his cellphones to them. The case remains open, but as of February 2023 Santos has not been identified as a suspect.\n\nAfter the story was reported in 2023, Trelha made a sworn declaration to the FBI that he had committed the crime at the urging of Santos, who had also taught him how to set up the skimmer and camera necessary to steal passwords and how to clone ATM and credit cards. The two had an agreement to split the proceeds, Trelha said, but after his arrest Santos kept all the money for himself, reneging on a promise to hire a top defense lawyer and pay Trelha's bail. At the time he said he declined to tell federal authorities as Santos had threatened to report his Orlando roommates to immigration authorities as they were in the U.S. illegally.}}\n\nSantos told reporters the day after ''Politico'' reported the declaration that he was innocent, saying, \"Never did anything of criminal activity, and I have no mastermind event.\" He said he had only met Trelha \"a couple of times in my life\" and that he had willingly assisted every law enforcement agency that contacted him: \"Got information for them. Got everybody arrested and deported.\"\n\n\nAlso in February 2023, Derek Myers, the prospective staffer who secretly recorded Santos admitting \"errors of judgment\" in making some of his claims, filed a  complaint against Santos with the House Ethics Committee, alleging Santos had touched his groin inappropriately while inviting him out to a  and telling Myers that his husband was out of town. Myers also alleged that Santos had violated House rules by having him work as a volunteer for a week before his paperwork was processed. Santos denied the allegation. In June, Myers told the Ethics Committee that he had gotten the job after sending seven payments of $150 each to Santos's director of operations.\n\nIn its November report, the committee said it could not substantiate the allegation. Myers (unnamed in the report) had said the incident occurred while he and Santos were alone in the office going over mail from constituents. However, witnesses told the committee that staff did not want someone from outside the office going over mail, and that Santos had never been alone with Myers that day. The committee also noted inconsistencies in Myers's testimony to them, and his admission that after the incident he reported it to the FBI in the hope of collecting money as an informant.\n\n\nIn May 2023, a grand jury in the  indicted Santos on 13 criminal charges: seven counts of , three counts of , one count of , and two counts of  to the House of Representatives. Prosecutors accused Santos of \"three distinct schemes\": fraudulent solicitation of political contributions, unemployment benefits fraud, and making false statements on the financial disclosure reports he submitted to the House of Representatives. In the fraudulent solicitation scheme, Santos allegedly persuaded two supporters to donate $25,000 each to a limited liability company controlled by him and then used the money for personal expenses. He told them it was a  and that the money would buy TV ads to support his campaign. During the , Santos also allegedly obtained a total of $24,000 in  from mid-2020 to April 2021 while drawing an annual salary of $120,000.\n\nAt the arraignment the day the indictment was unsealed, Santos pleaded not guilty and was granted  on a $500,000 bond with conditions, including surrendering his  and restricting his travel to Long Island, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Afterwards, he told reporters that this was a \"witch hunt\" and that he was still running for reelection in 2024.\n\nProsecutors turned over 80,000 pages of material to Santos's lawyers by June 2023.\n\nThe names of the guarantors of Santos's $500,000  were initially . Media outlets sought to unseal the names of the guarantors, a motion Santos opposed. District Judge  denied Santos's appeal and ordered the names unsealed; they were revealed to be Santos's father Gercino dos Santos Jr. and aunt Elma Santos Prevenand. They had not been required to put up any cash or property as collateral for the bond but would be liable for the entire amount if Santos fled.\n\nIn August 2023, Santos said he would not consider a plea deal at the time, but a month later prosecutors told the judge that they were both sharing substantial new evidence with Santos and his lawyer while looking at \"possible paths forward\" with them, raising speculation regarding a possible plea deal, which Santos has denied.\n\nMarks's guilty plea in October was seen as an ominous development for Santos, who was referred to as \"Co-Conspirator No. 1\" in her plea agreement, due to the falsifications in his campaign finance reports she admitted to making. \"One way or another, the government is going to use that information in his case\", said one law professor. Kappel said it was \"bad news\" for him, noting that the lack of a provision in the agreement that she continue cooperating may indicate that the government has enough evidence implicating Santos to believe her testimony would not be needed to convict him. Her plea agreement alluded to text and email exchanges between her and Santos.\n\n\n\nFive days after Marks's plea, prosecutors filed a superseding indictment, alleging 10 additional felonies committed by Santos including conspiracy against the United States, , aggravated identity theft, credit card fraud, and . These charges stemmed from not only the same effort to deceive the RNC that Marks had admitted to, but the unauthorized use of donor credit cards, the money raised by RedStone by lying about its political status and the purpose of the spending, much of which Santos allegedly converted to personal spending on clothing and other luxury items. In an October 27 court appearance, Santos pleaded not guilty to the new charges.\n\nSantos learned of the additional charges when questioned by reporters after leaving a  meeting where he said he had not had access to his phone. He called them \"bullshit\" and explained that he had not handled any of his campaign finance reports. \"I didn't even know what the hell the FEC was\" when he first ran for office, Santos said. Later he attributed them to Marks's mistakes and malfeasance.}}\n\nIn May 2024, Santos moved to have some of the charges dismissed. The dismissal relied on the Supreme Court ruling in the  that narrowed the applicability of the identity theft statute to cases where the act was at the crux of a . His attorneys therefore argued that even if Santos had used the names of others in his FEC filings and credit card charges, as alleged in the indictment, that would not constitute an aggravated identity theft.\n\n\nOn August 19, 2024, Santos pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft as part of a plea deal in which he also admitted to committing the other crimes with which he was charged in the superseding indictment. \"I accept full responsibility for my actions\", he told the judge. \"I allowed my ambition to cloud my judgment, leading me to make decisions that were unethical andguilty.\"\n\nSantos is scheduled for sentencing on February 7, 2025.  call for 6–8 years for the charges he pleaded to, with a possible maximum of 22 years. He will also be required to pay nearly $375,000 in restitution to victims and forfeit an additional $205,000; if he cannot pay the latter amount his property may be seized.\n\nAccording to , , the plea agreement was secured when Santos agreed to serve at least the two-year minimum required under law for the identity theft charges. While Santos only agreed to plead to two of the 23 counts in the indictment, his admission to the other charges means they can be considered in his sentencing. Peace said Santos also agreed not to appeal any sentence less than eight years.\n\n\nWithin three days after his expulsion from Congress, Santos started offering personalized videos on the website . Steven Galanis, one of the co-founders of the website, said that Santos's videos represented one of \"the best launches that [the website] ever had\". It was noted that the videos could potentially earn him well over \"the $174,000 salary he earned as a member of Congress\". Senator  spent $343 for a Cameo video from George Santos, as a prank against his colleague, .\n\nComedian  paid for videos to see if \"there's a line [that Santos] wouldn't cross\". Kimmel aired some of the videos on , after which Santos demanded $20,000 for the right to broadcast, which Kimmel refused to pay. In response, Santos filed suit in February 2024 against Kimmel,  (Kimmel's employer), and the  (ABC's owner) for $750,000, claiming that Kimmel intended to \"ridicule\" Santos. On August 19, 2024, a judge dismissed the suit, saying that Kimmel's actions constituted \"political commentary and criticism,\" which is protected under the  doctrine.\n\nIn December 2023, '''' parodied the way Santos offered to play the role of \"Santos Claus\" in his videos.\n\nSantos announced in April 2024 that he would revive his Kitara drag persona for Cameo videos, promising to donate to charity 20% of the proceeds. The , one of the charities Santos said proceeds from the Cameos would be donated to, said he had not informed them of his plans prior to making his announcement.\n\nIn June 2024, Santos announced that he had started an  account, though it was mentioned, however, that the account would not feature any adult content, but would rather be a \"behind-the-scenes\" look on his life and work.\n\n\nSantos is openly gay. He was married to a woman from 2012 to 2019, despite previously being , but lived with men he was involved with from 2013 on. Santos did not widely acknowledge his marriage to the woman, a Brazilian national, until it was reported in December 2022. In statements acknowledging the marriage, Santos said that he loved his then wife; however, he also said that he had been comfortably and openly gay for at least the preceding decade, an assertion broadly supported by friends, former coworkers, and roommates. Morey-Parker said that in 2014, the pair were on friendly terms and often socialized with him and others. Santos did not deny the marriage, but Santos was also open about his romance with his then boyfriend and told friends about it.\n\nSantos's coworkers at Dish, who understood him to be gay, speculated in 2012 that perhaps he got married to access his claimed familial wealth, to appease his family's concerns about his sexuality, or to help his wife with her immigration status. Adriana Parizzi, who was a close friend of Santos from Brazil and roommate of his early on in the marriage, says the marriage was purely for immigration purposes and that Santos was paid $20,000 for it. '''' reported that three of Santos's former roommates confirmed this. Santos has denied the allegation. Records show that a filing to dissolve the marriage in May 2013 was withdrawn in December of the same year. Four months later, Santos filed a family-based immigration petition on his wife's behalf; it was approved in July 2014, typically seen as a sign that  believed the marriage was valid. According to Santos's biographer, the woman has steadfastly refused to talk to the media about her relationship with Santos.\n\nIn 2020, Santos said he was living with a partner named Matheus Gerard, whom he has subsequently called his husband. Santos says the couple wed in November 2021.\n\n\nOn January 21, 2023, '''' featured  as Santos in its  and '''' segments.

The court found that Kimmel's decisions had been correct given the limited information available to him, but criticized then-Chief of Naval Operations  for failing to warn Kimmel that war was imminent. The court concluded that \"based upon the facts established, the Court is of the opinion that no offenses have been committed nor serious blame incurred on the part of any person or persons in the naval service.\" Because the court's findings implicitly revealed that  had broken the Japanese codes, a critical wartime secret, the court's report was not made public until after the end of the war.\n\nUpon reviewing the report, Forrestal felt that the court had been too lenient in assigning blame for the disaster. The court had found that the Army and Navy had adequately cooperated in the defense of Pearl Harbor; that there had been no information indicating that Japanese carriers were on their way to attack Pearl Harbor; and that the attack had succeeded principally because of the , a secret weapon whose use could not have been predicted. Forrestal disapproved all of these findings, judging that Kimmel could have done more with the information he had had to prevent or mitigate the attack.

When Forrestal witnessed the sight of the  atop Mount Suribachi, he turned to Major General  and said, \"the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.\" A second, larger flag was run up in its place, and this second flag-raising was the moment captured by Associated Press photographer  in his .\n\nIn the early months of 1945, Forrestal, along with Stimson and Under Secretary of State , strongly advocated a softer policy toward Japan that would permit a negotiated armistice, a face-saving surrender. Forrestal's primary concern was not the resurgence of a militarized Japan, but rather \"the menace of Russian  and its attraction for decimated, destabilized societies in Europe and Asia,\" and, therefore, keeping the  out of the war with Japan.Hoopes and Brinkley, pp. 205–214. The quoted line is from p. 208 So strongly did he feel about this matter that he cultivated negotiation efforts that some regarded as approaching insubordination.\n\n\n\nHis counsel on ending the war was finally followed, but not until the atomic bombs had been dropped on . On 10 August 1945, the day after the Nagasaki attack, the Japanese sent out a radio transmission saying that it was ready to accept the terms of the ' , \"with the understanding that said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of  as a sovereign ruler.\" That position still fell short of the U.S. \"unconditional surrender\" demand, retaining the sticking point that had held up the war's conclusion for months. Strong voices within the administration, including  , counseled fighting on. At that point, \"Forrestal came up with a shrewd and simple solution: Accept the offer and declare that it accomplishes what the Potsdam Declaration demanded. Say that the Emperor and the Japanese government will rule subject to the orders of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. This would imply recognition of the Emperor while tending to neutralize American public passions against the Emperor. President  liked this. It would be close enough to 'unconditional'.\"\n\nAfter the war, Forrestal urged Truman to take a hard line with the Soviets over Poland and other issues. In furtherance of the anti-Soviet position, he was the primary promoter of the famous \"\" by State Department official . \"[Averell] Harriman thought Forrestal's reaction [to the Kennan document] was a 'decisive' catalyst in shaping American opinion on the issue.\" He also strongly influenced the new Wisconsin Senator, , concerning infiltration of the government by Communists. Upon McCarthy's arrival in Washington in December 1946, Forrestal invited him to lunch. In McCarthy's words, \"Before meeting Jim Forrestal I thought we were losing to international Communism because of incompetence and stupidity on the part of our planners. I mentioned that to Forrestal. I shall forever remember his answer. He said, 'McCarthy, consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If they were merely stupid, they would occasionally make a mistake in our favor.' This phrase struck me so forcefully that I have often used it since.\"\n\n\n\n in Washington, D.C.]]\nIn 1947, Truman appointed him the first . Forrestal continued to advocate for complete racial integration of the , a policy eventually implemented in 1949.\n\nDuring private cabinet meetings with Truman in 1946 and 1947, Forrestal had argued against  on the grounds it would infuriate  who supplied oil needed for the  and national defense. Instead, Forrestal favored a federalization plan for Palestine. Outside the White House, response to Truman's continued silence on the issue was immediate. Truman received threats to cut off  from wealthy donors, as well as , including a letter accusing him of \"preferring  and Arab elements to the democracy-loving  of Palestine.\" Appalled by the intensity and implied threats over the partition question, Forrestal appealed to Truman in two separate cabinet meetings not to base his decision on partition, whatever the outcome, on the basis of political pressure. In his only known public comment on the issue, Forrestal stated to ,  from :\n\n...no group in this country should be permitted to influence our policy to the point it could endanger our national security.\n\nForrestal's statement soon earned him the active enmity of some congressmen and supporters of . He was also an early target of the  columnist and broadcaster , an opponent of  hostile to the Soviet Union, who began to regularly call for Forrestal's removal after Truman named him Secretary of Defense., ''Washington Head-Hunters'', New York: Time Publications, 24 January 1949 Pearson told his own , , that he believed Forrestal was \"the most dangerous man in America\" and claimed that if he was not removed from office, he would \"cause another world war\".\n\nUpon taking office as Secretary of Defense, Forrestal was surprised to learn that the administration did not  needs based on military threats posed by enemies of the United States and its interests. According to historian , Truman was known to approach defense budgetary requests in the abstract, without regard to defense response requirements in the event of conflicts with potential enemies. The president would begin by subtracting from total receipts the amount needed for domestic needs and recurrent operating costs, with any surplus going to the defense budget for that year. The Truman administration's willingness to slash conventional readiness needs for the Navy and Marine Corps soon caused fierce controversies within the upper ranks of their respective branches.Blair, Clay, ''The Forgotten War: America in Korea, 1950–1953'', Naval Institute Press (2003)\n\nDuring the Reagan years,  reflected upon the qualities which made a Secretary of Defense great: the ability to work with Congress, the ability for \"big-time management,\" and an ability at war planning. Nitze felt that Forrestal was the only one who possessed all three qualities together.\n\n\nAt the close of World War II, millions of dollars of serviceable equipment had been scrapped or abandoned rather than having funds appropriated for its storage costs. New military equipment ''en route'' to operations in the Pacific theater was scrapped or simply tossed overboard. Facing the wholesale demobilization of most of the US defense force structure, Forrestal resisted Truman's efforts to substantially reduce defense appropriations, but was unable to prevent a steady reduction in defense spending, resulting in major cuts not only in defense equipment stockpiles, but also in military readiness.\n\nBy 1948, Truman had approved military budgets billions of dollars below what the services were requesting, putting Forrestal in the middle of a fierce tug-of-war between the President and the . Forrestal was also becoming increasingly worried about the Soviet threat.See  to confirm that his concerns on the domestic front were quite legitimate His 18 months at Defense came at an exceptionally difficult time for the U.S. military establishment: Communist governments came to power in  and China; the Soviets imposed a  on  prompting the U.S.  to supply the city; the  followed the establishment of Israel; and negotiations were going on for the formation of .\n\n recorded he was in agreement with Forrestal's theories on the dangers of Soviet and International communist expansion. Eisenhower recalled that Forrestal had been \"the one man who, in the very midst of the war, always counseled caution and alertness in dealing with the Soviets.\" Eisenhower remembered on several occasions, while he was , he had been visited by Forrestal, who carefully explained his thesis that the Communists would never cease trying to destroy all . Eisenhower commented in his personal diary on 11 June 1949, \"I never had cause to doubt the accuracy of his judgments on this point.\"\n\nForrestal also opposed the unification of the military services proposed by the Truman officials. Even so, he helped develop the  that created the  (the  was not created as such until August 1949). With the former Secretary of War  retiring to private life, Forrestal was the next choice.\n\n downplays Forrestal's achievements:\n:Forrestal was not in FDR's inner circle, was not apprised of the Manhattan Project, and did not attend the major wartime conferences....Forrestal also ended up on the wrong side of the struggle to unify the armed forces....He slowed but did not stop the unification process as secretary of the navy and then had to live with legislation that prevented him from managing the military establishment efficiently as the country's first secretary of defense. In that capacity, however, Forrestal was unable to devise an integrated defense budget, work out a joint war plan, or compel the Joint Chiefs of Staff to accept presidential directives they did not like.\n\n\n  was expected to win the . Forrestal met with Dewey privately, and it was agreed he would continue as Secretary of Defense under a Dewey administration. Unwittingly, Forrestal would trigger a series of events that would not only undermine his already precarious position with Truman but also contribute to the loss of his job, his failing health and eventual demise. Weeks before the election, Pearson published an exposé of the meetings between Dewey and Forrestal.\nIn 1949, angered over Forrestal's continued opposition to his defense economization policies, and concerned about reports in the press over his mental condition, Truman abruptly asked Forrestal to resign. By March 31, 1949, Forrestal was out of a job. He was replaced by , an ardent supporter of Truman's defense retrenchment policy.\n\n\nIn 1949, exhausted from overwork, Forrestal entered psychiatric treatment. The attending psychiatrist,  George N. Raines, was handpicked by the . The  was as follows:\n# 1st week:  with .\n# 2nd – 5th weeks: a regimen of  combined with psycho-therapeutic interviews. According to Raines, the patient overreacted to the insulin much as he had to the amytal and this would occasionally throw him into a confused state with a great deal of agitation and confusion.\n# 4th week: insulin administered only in stimulating doses; 10 units of insulin four times a day, morning, noon, afternoon and evening.\n\nAccording to Raines, \"We considered  but thought it better to postpone it for another 90 days. In reactive depression if electro-shock is used early and the patient is returned to the same situation from which he came there is grave danger of suicide in the immediate period after they return... so strangely enough we left out electro-shock to avoid what actually happened anyhow.\"\n\n\nAlthough Forrestal told associates he had decided to resign, he was reportedly shattered when Truman abruptly asked for his resignation. His letter of resignation was tendered on March 28, 1949, and his condition steadily deteriorated.Hoopes and Brinkley, pp. 446–468. On the day of Forrestal's resignation from office, he was reported to have gone into a daze and was flown on a Navy airplane to the estate of Under Secretary of State  in , where Forrestal's wife, Josephine, was vacationing.  of the  in Kansas was consulted and he diagnosed \"severe depression\" of the type \"seen in  during the war\". The Menninger Clinic had successfully treated similar cases during the war, but Forrestal's wife, his friend and associate , Menninger, and Navy psychiatrist Captain George N. Raines decided to send the patient to the  (NNMC) in . He was checked into NNMC five days later. The decision to house him on the 16th floor instead of the first floor was justified in the same way. Forrestal's condition was officially announced as \"nervous and physical exhaustion\"; his lead doctor, Captain Raines, diagnosed his condition as \"depression\" or \"reactive depression\". As a person who prized anonymity and once stated that his hobby was \"obscurity\", Forrestal, with his policies, had been the constant target of vicious personal attacks from columnists, including  and . Pearson's protégé, , later asserted that Pearson \"hectored Forrestal with innuendos and false accusations\".\n\n]]\n\nForrestal seemed to be on the road to recovery, having regained  since his admission into the hospital. However, in the early morning hours of May 22, his body, clad only in the bottom half of a pair of pajamas, was found on a third-floor roof below the sixteenth-floor kitchen across the hall from his room. Forrestal's alleged last written statement, touted in the contemporary press and later biographers as an implied suicide note, was part of a poem from  translation of ' tragedy '''':\n\nFair , the billows' roar,\nWander around thee yet,\nAnd sailors gaze upon thy shore\nFirm in the Ocean set.\nThy son is in a foreign clime\nWhere  feeds her countless flocks,\nFar from thy dear, remembered rocks,\nWorn by the waste of time–\nComfortless, nameless, hopeless save\nIn the dark prospect of the yawning grave....\nWoe to the mother in her close of day,\nWoe to her desolate heart and temples gray,\nWhen she shall hear\nHer loved one's story whispered in her ear!\n\"Woe, woe!\" will be the cry–\nNo quiet murmur like the tremulous wail\nOf the lone bird, the querulous –\n\n\n\nThe official Navy review board, which completed hearings on May 31, waited until October 11, 1949, to release only a brief summary of its findings. The announcement, as reported on page 15 of the October 12 '''', stated only that Forrestal had died from his fall from the window. It did not say what might have caused the fall, nor did it make any mention of a bathrobe sash cord that had first been reported as tied around his neck. The full report was released by the Department of the Navy in April 2004.\n\n\nHe was buried at , in .\n\n\nForrestal's diaries from 1944 to March 1949 were serialised in the '''' in 1951, and published as a 581-page book ''The Forrestal Diaries'', edited by  in October 1951. They were censored prior to publication.  published a  of the complete and unexpurgated diaries in 2001, from the originals preserved in the , ; a digital edition was released in January 2020. An example of censorship is the removal of the following account of a conversation with Truman: \"He [the President] referred to Hitler as an egomaniac. The result is we shall have a  Europe for a long time to come. I don't think it is so bad.\"\n\n\nBiographer Arnold Rogow explores the pathos and tragedy of Forrestal's tormented life. He was brought up in a rigidly Catholic environment where harsh discipline gave the boy doubts about himself that were never overcome by his many achievements. He compensated by emphasizing toughness in terms of physicality and morality – he had no use for slackers or cowards. He felt war was a necessity and that negotiation was possible only alongside military parity or superiority. This intensity alienated his colleagues, as he focused his fears on Communists and Zionists. He abandoned his religion and his Irish community, but was never at ease on Wall Street, where he suspected and envied its rich and well-born . Although his brilliance and energy made him a favorite of President Roosevelt, he profoundly distrusted liberalism and never championed the New Deal.\n\n\nForrestal was awarded both the  and the  by President Truman.\n\n\n\nThe  in Washington, D.C., completed in 1969, is named for him.\n\nThe J.&nbsp;V. Forrestal Elementary School at 125 Liberty Street in , his hometown, is named for him. Forrestal Elementary School in the Great Lakes military housing area is named for him.\n\nThe aircraft carrier , in commission 1955–1993, was named for him\n\n\nIn the 2002  TV movie '''', Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (portrayed by Alec Baldwin) hauntingly recounts the story of James Forrestal's dismissal and suicide to speechwriter Richard Goodwin (portrayed by James Frain).\n\nIn the 2006 film '','' Forrestal was played by .\n\nThe story of James Forrestal is prominently featured in Chapter 4 of the  popular documentary series '','' which aired on Showtime in 2012–13.\n\nThe later part of Forrestal's life, including his marriage and his death, is a large part of ''Majic Man'' by .\n\nIn the anime OVA series '''', a secret document is briefly viewable in the eighth episode that mentions the death of a Secretary Forrestal. It goes on to say that a \"vacancy\" was left due to his death until he was replaced by an unnamed general.\n\n\nA number of works (shown below) have implied or indicated that Forrestal's death was suspicious or nefarious.\n\nIn December 1950,  published an article titled \"Untold Facts about the Death of James Forrestal\" in '''', which he co-owned. That article, later entered into the Congressional Record and republished, suggested Forrestal has been forced to resign amid pressure from \"disgruntled politicians, Communists, Zionists, and gossip columnists\".https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1950-pt12/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1950-pt12-8-1.pdf , pg. 16179 Huie opined that \"Much of the truth has thus far been suppressed, but the ghost of Jim Forrestal is not going to be laid until there are reasonable answers to such questions as these: Why was the attack on Forrestal so reckless and sadistically savage? Why have his papers been held secret? Where is the report of those who investigated his death? Why was the deposed Defense Secretary held a virtual prisoner at Bethesda Naval Hospital – a prisoner who could not be visited by his own priest.\"\n\nIn 1954, journalist  published a piece listing Forrestal's death as part of a pattern of suspicious deaths of federal officials. In 1955, anti-Communist investigative journalist  claimed, without evidence, that the former Secretary had been murdered by Communists. In 1966, a book-length treatment of the conspiracy theory was published in the fringe press.Hoopes & Brinkley, p.544\n\nIn a statement posted to the Paranet BBS in December 1987,  claimed that Forrestal's suicide was connected to the \"horrible truth\" about aliens and their interactions with humanity, and implies that his medical records remain sealed as part of the coverup initiated by President Truman.\n\nIn 2017, on the final episode of the  miniseries '''', journalist  implies that Forrestal's death may have been one of a series of deaths labeled as suicides that were actually covert assassinations by the CIA.\n''The Assassination of James Forrestal'', a 2019 nonfiction book by David Martin, argues that Forrestal was killed.\n\n\nForrestal conspiracy theories have been featured in numerous works of fiction. In the 1994 television movie '''', Forrestal is portrayed by . He is depicted as sitting on a commission concerning the  and advocating the eventual release of information to the public. The film treats his death and classified diary as highly suspicious.\n\nAn opera concerning the conspiracy theories behind Forrestal's death, ''Nightingale: The Last Days of James Forrestal'' composed by  with a libretto by , premiered in New York City at the Present Company Theatorium on May 19, 2002.\n\nIn '''', a  '''' \"imaginary story\" four-issue prestige format  by  (writer) and  (artist), Forrestal's death is shown to have been a murder. Forrestal is pushed from the window of his Bethesda Naval Hospital room by the Golden Age .\n\nIn the PC game '''' one of the secret documents the player can collect talks about the  initiative being threatened with \"receiving the same punishment as his last secretary, Forrestal\", implying the murder of Forrestal was to cover his operation from the public. (Forrestal was allegedly a member of Majestic 12.)\n\nThe 2020 film '''' suggests that in 1949, Forrestal was preparing to make public proof of alien visitations and technology, and was forced by two  to choose between committing suicide or seeing his entire family killed.

Holley became the first Black  of , and ultimately the city's longest serving mayor, although both his mayoral terms (separated by a decade) ended with his being  from office. Thus he became the only known politician in American history to be twice recalled until  Councilman Don Bankhead was recalled in June 2012.\n\n\nHolley was born in 1926. After graduating from Portsmouth's  in 1944, Holley served in the  during , stationed in  in . Following the war, he attended  (now West Virginia State University), and graduated with a  in 1949.

During a reception in the late 1950s, Holley met  student Mary Walker; the couple would marry in 1960.\n\nHolley was active during the  in the 1950s and 1960s, and played an integral role in the desegregation of Portsmouth, winning court battles which allowed for the equal use of the city's libraries, hospitals, restaurants and golf courses. In 1961, he and fellow dentist Dr. Hugo Owens, then the president of the local NAACP, requested service at the public library but were turned down because of their race, which ultimately led to the combination of that library with the segregated black library. During the course of his involvement in the civil rights movement, Holley entertained  at his home on multiple occasions.\n\n\nHolley first served as a member of the Portsmouth  from 1968 to 1984, and was vice-mayor from 1978 to 1980. Upon his election in 1968, he became the first  to serve on Portsmouth's City Council. He has twice held the office of mayor, first from July 1, 1984, to December 15, 1987, and again from July 1996 to July 13, 2010. Holley was also the first African American mayor in the city's history, and its longest serving mayor.\n\nHis first term came to an end following an expense account scandal, becoming the first  politician in modern times to be recalled.  sent to community leaders became another factor in his removal. His successor, Gloria O.

Holley was recalled for a second time on July 13, 2010. This second recall effort began in 2009 after an assistant made a confidential complaint of verbal abuse and of being required by Holley to perform his personal errands while working on city time. The accusations (leaked to the press) prompted the Portsmouth City Council to fine Holley $2,500 and ask him to retire, citing a pattern of mistreating subordinates. After Holley refused to retire, his opponents circulated a recall petition citing the allegations against him, which gathered 8000 signatures, which a judge deemed sufficient to place Holley's recall on the ballot for July 13, 2010.\nThough an , Holley backed both  and  running for office, including 's  and former  's .

He graduated in  class 58 in December 1970 and was part of  12.\n\nVentura has frequently referred to his military career in public statements and debates. He was criticized by hunters and conservationists for saying in a 2001 interview with the Minneapolis '''', \"Until you have hunted men, you haven't hunted yet.\"\n\n\nNear the end of his Navy service, Ventura began to spend time with the \"South Bay\" chapter of the  in .

At the same time, he began weightlifting and wrestling and became a member of the Japan Karate Association. He was a bodyguard for  and  for a time before entering professional wrestling and adopting the wrestling name Jesse Ventura.\n\n\n\n\n, ]]\nVentura created the stage name Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura to go with the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name \"\" from a map as part of his \"bleach blond from California\" . As a wrestler, Ventura performed as a , a decision he attributes to his ability to be more creative as a villain. He resurrected 's old motto of \"Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!\", which he emblazoned on his t-shirts. Much of this flamboyant persona was adapted from , a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s.John Molinaro, ''The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time'', (Winding Stair Press: 2002), page 199\n\nIn 1975, Ventura made his debut in the Central States territory, before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he wrestled for promoter  as Jesse \"The Great\" Ventura. During his stay in , he had notable feuds with  and  and won the Pacific Northwest Wrestling title twice (once from each wrestler) and the tag team title five times (twice each with  and , and once with Jerry Oates). He later moved to his hometown promotion, the  in Minnesota and began teaming with  as the \"East-West Connection\" in 1979. In his RF Video shoot in 2012, he revealed that shortly after he arrived in the AWA he was given the nickname \"the Body\" by . The duo won the  on July 20, 1980, on a  when Gagne, one-half of the tag team champions along with , failed to show up for a title defense in , Colorado. The duo held the belts for nearly a year, losing to \"The High Flyers\" ( and ).\n\n\n\n\nShortly after losing the belts, the duo moved on to the , where they were managed by . Although the duo was unable to capture the , both Adonis and Ventura became singles title contenders, each earning several title shots at  .\n\nVentura continued to wrestle until September 1984 after three back-to-back losses to world champion , when blood clots in his lungs effectively ended his in-ring career. He claimed that the clots were a result of his exposure to  during his time in Vietnam. Ventura returned to the ring in 1985, forming a tag-team with  and Savage's manager (and real-life wife) . Often after their televised matches Ventura taunted and challenged fellow commentator , but nothing ever came of this.\n\nVentura participated in a six-man tag-team match in December 1985 when he, , and  defeated , , and  in a match broadcast on ''''. The tag match against the Hillbillies came about after Piper and Orton interrupted Elmer's wedding ceremony on the previous edition of the show; Ventura, who later claimed that he was under instruction from fellow commentator and WWF owner  to \"bury them\", insulted Elmer and his wife during commentary of a real wedding ceremony at the , by proclaiming when they kissed: \"It looks like two  in the middle of the  going after the same piece of corn.\" According to Ventura, the wedding was real, for at that time the  would not allow the WWF to stage a fake wedding in the state of , so Stan Frazier (Uncle Elmer) and his fiancee had agreed to have a real in-ring wedding.\n\nAfter a failed comeback bid, Ventura hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's ''All Star Wrestling'' TV program called \"The Body Shop\", in much the same heel style as \"Piper's Pit\", though the setting was a mock gym (when Ventura was unavailable, \"The Body Shop\" was often hosted by ). He began to do  on television for '''', replacing , and later '''', initially alongside Vince McMahon and the semi-retired Sammartino, and then just with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in early 1988. Ventura most notably co-hosted '''' with McMahon, the first six s (five of which were alongside ), and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with Monsoon, with the lone exception for Ventura being the , in which he served as the guest referee during the main event.\n\nVentura's entertaining commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, i.e., a \"\", as he was partial to the villains, something new and different at the time. McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, came up with the idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly favored the .\n\nBut Ventura still occasionally gave credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of fan favorites such as  and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels  and .\n\nOne notable exception to this rule was the  Ultimate Challenge title for title match between   and the , The . Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at WrestleMania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, \"This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty.\" Ventura's praise of Hogan's action was unusual for him, because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a WrestleMania that he might \"come out of retirement and take this dude out\".\n\nHogan and Ventura were at one point close friends,Jesse Ventura, \"I Ain't Got Time To Bleed pg. 108 but Ventura abruptly ended the friendship in 1994 after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1986 before . After a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a  product, Ventura left the WWF in August 1990.\n\nVentura later served as a radio announcer for a few  teams, among them the  and .\n\nIn February 1992 at , Ventura joined  as a commentator. WCW President  ultimately released him for allegedly falling asleep during a ''WCW Worldwide'' TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, but it has been speculated that the move may have had more to do with Hogan's arrival shortly before.\n\n\nIn 1987, while negotiating his contract as a  commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In November 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received , Ventura brought an action for fraud, misappropriation of publicity rights, and  in   against Titan Sports, asking for $2&nbsp;million (~$}} in ) in royalties based on a fair market value share. Titan moved the case to , and Ventura won an $801,333 jury  on the last claim. In addition, the judge awarded him $8,625 in back pay for all non-video WWF merchandising featuring Ventura. The judgment was affirmed on appeal, and the case,'' ''65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of . As a result, Ventura's commentary is removed on most releases from .\n\n\nIn mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF television during his term as governor of Minnesota, acting as the special guest referee for the main event of  held in Minneapolis. Ventura continued his relationship with the WWF by performing commentary for Vince McMahon's short-lived . On the June 4, 2001, episode of ''Raw'' which aired live from Minnesota, Ventura appeared to overrule McMahon's authority and approve a WWF Championship match between then-champion  and . On the March 20, 2003, episode of '','' Ventura appeared in a  to talk about the match between McMahon and Hogan at . On March 13, 2004, he was inducted into the , and the following night at , he approached the ring to interview , who had a front-row seat at the event. Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to ever reenter politics. Alluding to the , Ventura boldly announced, \"I think we oughta put a wrestler in the  in 2008!\". Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009, episode of ''Raw,'' during which he retained his  persona by siding with the number one contender  over WWE Champion . This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE, while Ventura never did during his WWE career. After that, Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at . During the show, for the first time in nearly 20 years, McMahon joined Ventura ringside to provide match commentary together.\n\n\nNear the end of his wrestling career, Ventura began an acting career. He appeared in the movie '''' (1987), whose cast included future California   and future   candidate . Ventura became close friends with Schwarzenegger during the production of ''Predator''. He appeared in two episodes of '''' filmed in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. He had a starring role in the 1990 sci-fi movie ''''. He had supporting roles in '''' (again with Schwarzenegger), '''', '''', '''', '''', '''', '''' (in which he steals the ), , and ''''the first and last of these also starring Schwarzenegger. Ventura made a cameo appearance in '''' as \"White Lightning\". He appeared as a self-help guru (voice only) in '''', trying to turn  into a more confident worker. Ventura had a cameo in '''' episode \"\" as a  alongside fellow 'MiB' . In 2008, Ventura was in the independent comedy '''', starring as high school shop teacher Mr. Madson. The film was released September 7, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVentura was a bodyguard for  in the late 1970s and 1980s. Its lead singer, , said of him, \"He's done us proud, hasn't he? He's been fantastic.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, Ventura appeared in a series of  commercials.\n\nIn 1989, Ventura co-hosted the four episodes of the  children's program '''' along with Gary Apple. In 1991, the pilot episode for ''Tag Team'', a television program about two ex-professional wrestlers turned police officers, starred Ventura and .\n\nVentura also co-hosted the short-lived syndicated game show '''' alongside sportscaster .\n\nBetween 1995 and 1998, Ventura had  on  1130 and  1500 in . He also had a brief role on the television soap opera '''' in 1999.\n\nOn April 12, 1996, Ventura starred in '''' Season 3 episode  as a mysterious Man in Black.\n\nVentura has been criticized by the press for profiting from his heightened popularity. He was hired as a television analyst for the failed   league in 2001, served as a referee at a , and published several books during his tenure as governor. On his weekly radio show, he often criticized the media for focusing on these deals rather than his policy proposals.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012,  aired three seasons of the television series ''''.\n\nVentura had a guest spot on an episode of the 2012 rebooted '''' animated series on .\n\nIn 2013, Ventura announced a new show, ''Jesse Ventura: Uncensored'', which launched on January 27, 2014, and later renamed ''Off the Grid'', and aired until 2016 on , an online  network founded by .\n\nIn 2017, Ventura became the host of the show ''The World According to Jesse'' on ; the series ended in March 2022 when RT programming produced by its production partner Ora TV was suspended after . RT America ceased operations on March 3, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his departure from the WWF, Ventura took a former high school teacher's advice and ran for mayor of , in 1990.Jake Tapper, \"Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story,\" pp. 105–108 He defeated the city's 18-year incumbent mayor and served from 1991 to 1995. Many , but Ventura is among the few, including  and , to have remained active in wrestling while serving in a government role: he was simultaneously mayor and WCW's color commentator through much of his mayoral tenure.\n\n\n\n Chamber in 2000]]\nVentura ran for governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the Reform Party of Minnesota nominee (he later joined the  when the Reform Party broke from its association with the ). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive  events organized in part by his campaign manager  and original television spots, designed by quirky adman , using the phrase \"Don't vote for politics as usual.\" He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the Internet as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.\n\nHe won the election in November 1998, narrowly and unexpectedly defeating the major-party candidates,   mayor  and   . During his victory speech, Ventura famously declared, \"We shocked the world!\" After his election, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan \"My governor can beat up your governor\" appeared in Minnesota. The nickname \"Jesse 'The Mind (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin's ''Thinker'') began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his often controversial remarks. Ventura's old stage name \"Jesse 'The Body (sometimes adapted to \"Jesse 'The Governing Body) also continued to appear with some regularity.\n\nAfter a trade mission to China in 2002, Ventura announced that he would not run for a second term, saying that he no longer felt dedicated enough to his job and accusing the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and beliefs while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. He later told a '''' reporter that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media's effect on his family life.\n\nVentura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, , an opportunity to serve as governor. He further said that he wanted her to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors'. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.\n\n\n, March 2000]]\n and  in 2002]]\nIn , Ventura often admitted that he had not formed an opinion on certain policy questions. He often called himself \"fiscally conservative and socially liberal.\" He selected teacher  as his running mate.\n\nLacking a party base in the  and , Ventura's policy ambitions had little chance of being introduced as bills. He vetoed 45 bills in his first year, only three of which were overridden. The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, when six of his nine vetoes were overridden. Nevertheless, Ventura succeeded with some of his initiatives. One of the most notable was the rebate on ; each year of his administration, Minnesotans received a tax-free check in the late summer. The state was running a  surplus at the time, and Ventura believed the money should be returned.\n\nLater, Ventura came to support a  (one-house) legislature,  reform, , , and abortion rights. While funding  education generously, he opposed the teachers' union, and did not have a high regard for public funding of higher education institutions.\n\nIn an interview on ''The Howard Stern Show'', he reaffirmed his support of gay rights, including marriage and military service, humorously stating he would have gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would have provided less competition for women. Later, on the subject of a  on amending the  to limit marriage to male-female couples, Ventura said, \"I certainly hope that people don't amend our constitution to stop gay marriage because, number one, the constitution is there to protect people, not oppress them\", and related a story from his wrestling days of a friend who was denied hospital visitation to his same-sex partner.\n\nDuring the first part of his administration, Ventura strongly advocated for land-use reform and substantial  improvements, such as .\n\nDuring another trade mission to  in the summer of 2002, he denounced the , saying the embargo affected the Cuban public more than it did its government.\n\n\nVentura greatly disapproved of some of the events at the 2002 memorial for  , his family, and others who died in a plane crash on October 25, 2002. Ventura said, \"I feel used. I feel violated and duped over the fact that the memorial ceremony turned into a political rally\". He left halfway through the controversial speech made by Wellstone's best friend, Rick Kahn. Ventura had initially planned to appoint a Democrat to Wellstone's seat, but instead appointed  to represent  in the Senate until Wellstone's term expired in January 2003. Barkley was succeeded by , who won the  against , who replaced Wellstone as the Democratic nominee after Wellstone died a few days before the election.\n\n as governor, Ventura returned to the State Capitol in May 2023 for Governor 's signing of a cannabis legalization bill.]]\nVentura, who ran on a Reform Party ticket and advocated for a greater role for third parties in American politics, is highly critical of both Democrats and Republicans. He has called both parties \"monsters that are out of control\", concerned only with \"their own agendas and their pork.\"\n\nIn his book ''Independent Nation'', political analyst  calls Ventura a  thinker and activist.\n\n\nAfter the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in .\n\nIn 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\" The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, the Chief Justice must review recall petitions for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.\n\nVentura was also criticized for mishandling the Minnesota state budget, with Minnesota state economist Tom Stinson noting that the statewide capital gain fell from $9 billion to $4 billion between 2000 and 2001. Ventura had vetoed this budget, but the state legislature overrode him. This deficit received national attention, for instance making a 10-question interview by '''' journalist Matthew Cooper with Ventura. When Ventura left office in 2003, Minnesota had a $4.2&nbsp;billion budget deficit, compared to the $3&nbsp;billion budget surplus when Ventura took office in 1999.\n\nDuring his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the Twin Cities press. He called reporters \"media jackals,\" with the label \"Official Jackal\" even appearing on the press passes required to enter his press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and   wrote a  book about him, ''Me: Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente'', depicting a self-aggrandizing former \"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Ventura initially responded angrily to the satire, but later said Keillor \"makes Minnesota proud\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the '''', in which he responded controversially to the following question: \"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\". Ventura responded, \"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\". He later apologized for the remark, saying it was not intended to be taken seriously.\n\n\n\nWhile Ventura has not held public office since the end of his term as governor in 2003, he has remained politically active and occasionally hinted at running again for political office. In an April 7, 2008, interview on CNN's '''', Ventura said he was considering entering the  the  seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 gubernatorial race. A  station  poll put him at 24%, behind Democratic candidate  at 32% and Coleman at 39% in a hypothetical three-way race. On '''' on July 14, 2008, Ventura said he would not run, partly out of concern for his family's privacy. Franken won the election by a very narrow margin.\n\nIn his 1999 autobiography ''I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'', Ventura suggested that he did not plan to run for president of the United States but did not rule it out. In 2003, he expressed interest in running for president while accepting an award from the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Newton, Iowa. He spoke at Republican presidential candidate 's \"\", organized by the , on September 2, 2008, and implied a possible future run for president. At the end of his speech, Ventura announced if he saw that the public was willing to see a change in the direction of the country, then \"in  we'll give them a race they'll never forget!\" In 2011, Ventura expressed interest in running with Ron Paul in the  if Paul would run as an . On November 4, 2011, Ventura said at a press conference about the dismissal of his court case against the  for what he claimed were illegal searches of air travelers that he was \"thinking about\" running for president. There were reports that the  officials had tried to persuade Ventura to run for president on a Libertarian ticket, but party chairman Mark Hinkle said, \"Jesse is more interested in 2016 than he is in 2012. But I think he's serious. If Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian, I think he definitely would be interested in running as a vice presidential candidate. He's thinking, 'If I run as the vice presidential candidate under Ron Paul in 2012, I could run as a presidential candidate in 2016'.\"\n\nDavid Gewirtz of ZDNet wrote in a November 2011 article that he thought Ventura could win if he declared his intention to run at that point and ran a serious campaign, but that it would be a long shot.\nIn late 2015, Ventura publicly flirted with the idea of running for president in 2016 as a  but allowed his self-imposed deadline of May 1 to pass. He also expressed an openness to be either 's or 's running mate in 2016. Ventura tried to officially endorse Sanders but his endorsement was rejected. Ventura then endorsed former  Governor , the Libertarian nominee, saying, \"Johnson is a very viable alternative\" and \"This is the year for a third-party candidate to rise if there ever was one.\" Despite this, he later claimed that he ultimately voted for  nominee .\n\n\nVentura expressed interest in running for president again in 2020, but said he would do so only under the Green Party banner. \"The [Green Party] has shown some interest. I haven't made a decision yet because it's a long time off. If I do do it, Trump will not have a chance. For one, Trump knows wrestling. He participated in two WrestleManias. He knows he can never out-talk a wrestler, and he knows I'm the greatest talker wrestling's ever had.\"\n\nOn April 27, 2020, Ventura submitted a letter of interest to the Green Party Presidential Support Committee, the first step to seeking the Green Party's presidential nomination. In May, he announced that he would not run for health reasons, explaining that he would lose his employer-provided health insurance.\n\nVentura said he would  his own name in the presidential election, but would support Green candidates in down-ballot races. He said he \"refuse[s] to vote for '' because in the end, that's still choosing evil.\" Ventura received seven presidential delegate votes at the , having been awarded them through write-in votes in the . Despite the national Green Party nominating  for president and  for vice president, the  nominated Ventura and former representative  without Ventura's consent. Ventura and McKinney  0.7% of the Alaska popular vote.\n\n\nVentura has described himself as \"fiscally conservative\" and \"socially liberal\". He has said his first memory of political independence is voting for  for president in 1980.\n\n\nIn a May 11, 2009, interview with , Ventura twice said that  was the worst president of his lifetime, adding \" inherited something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. You know? Two wars, an economy that's borderline depression.\" On the issue of , Ventura added:\n\n. It was a required school you had to go to prior to going into the combat zone, which in my era was Vietnam. All of us had to go there. We were all in essence, every one of us was waterboarded. It is torture. [King: What was it like?] It's drowning. It gives you the complete sensation that you are drowning. It's no good, because youI'll put it to you this way, you give me a water board, , and one hour, and I'll have him confess to the ... If it's done wrong, you certainly could drown. You could swallow your tongue. [It] could do a whole bunch of stuff to you. If it's done wrong orit's torture, Larry.

Big Cat Rescue volunteers began to track Exotic's movements and  managers of shopping malls that hosted his shows, prompting many of them to cancel, which jeopardized his income.\n\nExotic saw Baskin's actions as hypocritical because she also operated an animal sanctuary that charged admission, albeit for nonprofit purposes. Exotic responded to Baskin's social media efforts by setting up his own TV studio and YouTube channel at the G.W. Zoo, hosting a nightly talk show that aired vitriolic attacks against Big Cat Rescue and Baskin personally.

The 4th district is historically competitive, due in part to its high amount of third-party and independent voters. At the time, Republicans had a voter registration advantage in the district. Katz campaigned on a platform of improving public schools and increasing access to healthcare. Katz won the Democratic nomination over nonprofit executive Dee Durham with 63.0% of the vote before edging out  member John Clatworthy in the general election by just 1.3%. Katz raised $97,039 for his campaign.\n\nWhile in office, Katz supported the movement to preserve the historic Murphy House; however, the house was demolished in 2012.

In 2011, Katz accused Democratic state representative  of plagiarizing a bill he wrote to establish an accreditation process for s. Katz also refused to list Short as a cosponsor on his bill due to what he perceived as Short's \"poor treatment of the medical community during his private and public deliberations\" on an earlier bill. Short acknowledged his bill was very similar to Katz's bill, but argued that both bills were based on language written by the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and the Medical Society of Delaware months earlier. Short also believed that Katz's bill contained too many protections for doctors, saying \"each piece of legislation Sen. Katz introduced has skewed in favor of his profession.\" Katz asked House Majority Leader  to open an ethics investigation into Short, but Schwartzkopf refused, pointing out that only members of the House could make such a request.

She later worked briefly as a retail pharmacist and then spent 15 years at Raleigh Community Hospital (now known as Duke Raleigh North) as a hospital pharmacist while raising her three children.\n\n\nIn 2002, after 22 years as a retail and hospital pharmacist, McFarlane launched MedPro Rx, Inc., an accredited specialty infusion pharmacy that provides infusion medications and services to clients with chronic illnesses. \"I wanted to provide more than medicine,\" she said. \"I wanted to offer the support and services that are often lost in bigger companies.\" She has built the company into one of Inc. Magazine's fastest-growing companies from 2009 to 2011. In 2013, McFarlane was named one of the top entrepreneurs in the Triangle region by Business Leader Magazine.\n\n\n news television crew in 2012]]\nMcFarlane won the District A City Council seat in 2007, and ran without opposition in 2009. She served on the Budget and Economic Development Committee and was chair of the Comprehensive Planning Committee.\n\nMcFarlane worked with the Coalition to Unchain Dogs which works to mitigate the negative consequences of keeping dogs chained and she initiated the tasking of the City Attorney to draw up the Dog Tethering Ordinance which was unanimously passed by the City Council on March 3, 2009, and took effect July 1 of that year.\n\n\n\nWhen her predecessor in the office, , decided to not seek re-election as mayor in 2011, he suggested to both McFarlane and fellow city councilor (and eventual successor)  that one of the two should run in his place.  She had been approached earlier with a similar suggestion, but considering herself largely apolitical, turned down the offer at that time.  Baldwin was, at the time, dealing with personal issues and declined to run, so McFarlane accepted the offer, and decided to run for mayor that year.  Running as an , she won 61% of the vote over the next candidate, a .\n\nBeing new to politics, she frequently sought advice both from her predecessor Meeker and former Raleigh mayor , as well as then New York City mayor .  She developed a leadership style described as \"dull\", with her council meetings almost always featuring unanimous votes.  This was due to her efforts holding discussions with council members outside of meetings to handle negotiations out of the public eye, and keep meetings efficient.\n\nShe presided over Raleigh during a period of unprecedented growth, as the formerly moribund downtown area was rebuilt, and as the population growth was among the highest in the United States.  Her biggest achievement during her time as mayor, and the one fraught with the most controversy, was the acquisition of the 325-acre campus of the former , which had been sought by the city for some time as a potential large public park.  At a time when North Carolina state party politics was shifting from Democratic to Republican control of the legislature and major state offices, McFarlane finalized a deal during the last months of outgoing governor 's term for the state of North Carolina (which owned the Dix property) to lease the land to the city of Raleigh.  The new governor, , backed by the legislature, made several attempts early in his term to halt or reverse the deal, but she developed a close working relationship with McCrory, himself a former mayor of a large North Carolina city () and in 2015, he reversed his former position and the lease was signed, allowing the city to build its park on the land.\n\nMcFarlane remained popular and was easily re-elected in 2013 and 2015, with her only serious opposition coming from Charles Francis during the 2017 campaign.  Following the 2017 election, her formerly smooth working relationship with the council was upended when internal political divisions led to several factions developing within the council, and unlike her prior terms, where there was little public debate, council meetings became acrimonious affairs where several council members attempted to form a \"working majority\" to steer the council in their own political direction and away from McFarlane's.\n\nFollowing surgery to correct debilitating back pain, on March 13, 2019, McFarlane announced that she would not be seeking re-election to a fifth term as mayor.  She was replaced in the 2019 election as mayor by her long-time political ally Mary-Ann Baldwin, and many of the council members who stood against her during her last term as mayor lost their seats on the city council, with the Baldwin administration re-enacting many of McFarlane's prior policies and programs.\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* \n*\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Kennedy litigated and supervised  lawsuits on the east coast estuaries on behalf of Hudson Riverkeeper and the , where he was also a board member. Long Island Soundkeeper sued several municipalities and cities along the Connecticut and New York coastlines.

His work at Riverkeeper set long-term environmental legal standards.\n\nIn 1995, Kennedy advocated for repeal of legislation during the 104th Congress that he considered unfriendly to the environment. In 1997, he worked with John Cronin to write '''', a history of the early Riverkeepers and a primer for the Waterkeeper movement.\n\nIn 2000, a majority of Riverkeeper's board sided with Kennedy when he insisted on rehiring William Wegner, a wildlife lecturer and falcon trainer whom the organization's founder and president, , had fired six months earlier after learning that Wegner had been convicted in 1995 for tax fraud, perjury, and conspiracy to violate wildlife protection laws. Wegner had recruited and led a team of at least 10 who smuggled cockatoo eggs, including species considered endangered by Australia, from Australia to the U.S. over a period of eight years. He served 3.5 years of a five-year sentence and was hired by Kennedy a few months after his release from prison.

Kennedy was featured in a 2004 documentary about the plant, ''Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable'', directed by his sister, the documentary filmmaker . In 2017, Kennedy argued that the electricity Indian Point provided could be fully replaced by renewable energy.

The clinic's full-time clients are Riverkeeper and Long Island Soundkeeper.Kennedy, Robert F. Jr., Solow, Steven P. (1993). \"Environmental Litigation as Clinical Education: A Case Study\". ''University of Oregon Journal of Environmental Law and Litigation'' Volume 8.\n\nThe clinic has sued governments and companies for polluting Long Island Sound and the Hudson River and its tributaries. It argued cases to expand citizen access to the shoreline and won hundreds of settlements for the Hudson Riverkeeper. Kennedy and his students also sued dozens of municipal wastewater treatment plants to force compliance with the . In 2010, a Pace lawsuit forced  to clean up tens of millions of gallons of oil from legacy refinery spills in Newtown Creek in Brooklyn.\n\nOn April 11, 2001, '''' gave Kennedy its \"Heroes\" Award for creating the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic. Kennedy and the clinic received other awards for successful legal work cleaning up the environment. The Pace Clinic became a model for similar environmental law clinics throughout the country, including Rutgers, Golden Gate, UCLA, Widener, and Boalt Hall at Berkeley.\n\n\nIn June 1999, as Riverkeeper's success on the Hudson began inspiring the creation of Waterkeepers across North America, Kennedy and a few dozen Riverkeepers gathered in Southampton, Long Island, to found the , which is now the umbrella group for the 344 licensed Waterkeeper programs in 44 countries. As president, Kennedy oversaw its legal, membership, policy and fundraising programs. The Alliance is dedicated to promoting \"swimmable, fishable, drinkable waterways, worldwide\" and is also a clearinghouse, approving new Keeper programs and licensing use of the trademarked \"Waterkeeper\", \"Riverkeeper\", \"Soundkeeper\", \"Lakekeeper\", \"Baykeeper\", \"Bayoukeeper\", \"Canalkeeper\", \"Coastkeeper\", etc. names.\n\nUnder Kennedy's leadership, Waterkeeper launched its \" is a Deadly Lie\" campaign in 2001, bringing dozens of lawsuits targeting mining practices, including  and  pond construction, as well as coal-burning utilities' mercury emissions and  piles.

In the 1990s, Kennedy rallied opposition to factory farms among small independent farmers, convened a series of \"National Summits\" on factory meat products, and conducted press conference whistle-stop tours across North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, and in Washington, D.C. Beginning in 2000, Kennedy sued factory farms in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Maryland, and Iowa. In a 2003 article, he argued factory farms produce lower-quality, less healthy food, and harm independent family farmers by poisoning their air and water, reducing their property values, and using extensive state and federal subsidies to impose unfair competition against them.\n\nKennedy and his environmental work have been the focus of several films, including ''The Waterkeepers'' (2000), directed by .

Kennedy wrote in opposition to the project, and took the campaign to Japan, meeting with the , .\n\nIn 2000, he assisted local environmental activists to stop proposals by Chaffin Light, a real estate developer, and U.S. engineering giant  from building a large hotel and resort development that, Kennedy argued, threatened s and public beaches used by local Bahamians, at Clifton Bay,  Island.\n\nKennedy was one of the early editors of '''', North America's largest  newspaper. He helped lead the opposition to the damming of the  in the  of Chile.

Kennedy served 30 days in a maximum security prison in Puerto Rico. The trespassing incident forced the suspension of s for almost three hours. The lawsuits and protests by Kennedy, and hundreds of Puerto Ricans who were also imprisoned, eventually forced the termination of naval bombing in Vieques by .\n\nIn a 2003 article for the '''', Kennedy said the U.S. federal government was \"America's biggest polluter\" and the  as the worst offender. Citing the  (EPA), he said, \"unexploded ordnance waste can be found on 16,000 military ranges...and more than half may contain biological or chemical weapons\".\n\n\nIn 1991, Kennedy helped lead a campaign to block  from building the James Bay Hydro-project, a massive dam project in northern Quebec.\n\nHis campaigns helped block dams on Chile's  in 1990 (November 1992). \"Last Run Down the Bio Bio\".

Taking the side of Cape Cod's commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the project was a costly boondoggle.

He has said that environmentalists' priority should be to tackle the \"carbon industry\". He has called the current society and economy unsustainable and based on a \"longtime deadly addiction to coal and oil\" and contended that the economic system rewards pollution. In 2020, Kennedy said: \"Right now, we have a market that is governed by rules that were written by the carbon incumbents to reward the dirtiest, filthiest, most poisonous, most toxic, most war-mongering fields from hell, rather than the cheap, clean, green, wholesome and patriotic fields from heaven.\"\n\nKennedy has advocated for a global transition from  to , but has opposed hydropower from dams.

And the consequences of promoting this kind of disinformation, as credible as it may seem, is simply dangerous.\"\n\nKennedy has said that he is not against vaccines but wants them to be more thoroughly tested and investigated. In ''Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak'', Kennedy writes that he does not see himself as anti-vaccine: \"People who advocate for safer vaccines should not be marginalized or denounced as anti-vaccine. I am pro-vaccine. I had all six of my children vaccinated.

Experts roundly criticized these further claims, pointing out that the study said nothing about Chinese people or bioweapons and that Chinese people and Ashkenazi Jews contract COVID at rates similar to other ethnic groups and nationalities.

Kennedy refers to the \"orthodoxy that HIV alone causes AIDS\" and the \"theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS\", and repeats the false  claim that no one has isolated the HIV particle and \"No one has been able to point to a study that demonstrates their hypothesis using accepted scientific proofs\".

Kennedy called this ''Vanity Fair'' piece a \"lot of garbage\". When asked specifically about Cooney's allegation, he responded, \"I am not a church boy. I had a very, very rambunctious youth.

A June 1992 Gallup poll showed Perot leading a three-way race against President Bush and presumptive  nominee . Perot withdrew from the race in July, but re-entered the race in early October after he qualified for all 50 state ballots. He chose Admiral  as his running mate and appeared in the 1992 debates with Bush and Clinton. In the election, Perot did not win any electoral votes, but won over 19.7&nbsp;million votes for an 18.9% share of the popular vote. He won support from across the ideological and partisan spectrum, but performed best among self-described moderates. Perot ran for president again in 1996, establishing the  as a vehicle for his campaign. He won 8.4 percent of the popular vote against President Clinton and  nominee .\n\nPerot did not seek public office again after 1996. He endorsed Republican  over Reform nominee  in the 2000 election and supported Republican  in 2008 and 2012. In 2009,  acquired Perot Systems for $3.9&nbsp;billion ($&nbsp;billion in ). According to '''', Perot was the 167th richest person in the United States as of 2016. Perot died from  in , Texas, on July 9, 2019.\n\n\nRoss Perot was born in  in 1930, the son of Lula May ( Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot, a  specializing in cotton contracts. He had an older brother, Gabriel Perot Jr., who died as a toddler. His patrilineal line traces back to a  immigrant to the  in the 1740s.\n\nPerot attended a local private school, Patty Hill, before graduating from  in Texarkana in 1947. His first job, at eight years old, was helping to distribute the ''Texarkana Gazette'' as a paperboy. He joined the  and made  in 1942, after 13 months in the program, and was a recipient of the . One of Perot's childhood friends was , who later became the  of the  and a prominent lawyer in .\n\nFrom 1947 to 1949, he attended , then entered the  in 1949 and helped establish its . Perot claimed his appointment notice to the academysent by telegramwas sent by , Texas's 34th governor and former senator. Perot served as a junior officer on a destroyer, and later, an aircraft carrier from 1953 to 1957.  Perot, who had only ever owned one pair of shoes at a time, was shocked to find that he was issued multiple pairs of shoes in the navy, which he would later point to as \"possibly my first example of government waste\". Perot then went to the Naval Reserve, which he left on June 30, 1961, with the rank of . His father died when Perot was 25 years old.\n\nIn 1956, Perot married Margot Birmingham, whom he met on a blind date as a midshipman docked in .\n\n\nAfter he left the Navy in 1957, Perot became a salesman for . He quickly became a top employee (one year, he fulfilled his annual sales quota in two weeks) and tried to pitch his ideas to supervisors, who largely ignored him. He left IBM in 1962 to found  (EDS) in , Texas, and courted large corporations for his data processing services. Perot was denied bids for contracts 77 times before receiving his first contract. EDS received lucrative contracts from the  in the 1960s, computerizing  records. EDS  in 1968, and the stock price rose from $16 a share to $160 within days. '''' called Perot the \"fastest, richest Texan\" in a 1968 cover story. In December 1969, his shares in EDS were briefly worth $1 billion. Perot gained some press attention for being \"the biggest individual loser ever on the \" when his EDS shares dropped $445&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;billion in today's money) in value in a single day in April 1970.\n\nIn 1984,  bought a controlling interest in EDS for $2.4&nbsp;billion ($&nbsp;billion). In 1985, Perot sold EDS to General Motors with the idea that he and EDS would have a leadership role within the company. However, Perot's plan was ignored by the management of General Motors, prompting Perot to leave and later found Perot Systems. Perot's experience with GM contributed to him becoming an outspoken critic of corporate America. \nIn the same year, Perot became the second-richest man in the United States, only behind , with a fortune estimated at $1.8&nbsp;billion ($&nbsp;billion), according to the  list of the wealthiest people in the United States.\n\n \nJust before the 1979 , the government of Iran imprisoned two EDS employees in a contract dispute. Perot organized and sponsored their rescue. The rescue team was led by retired   . When the team was unable to find a way to extract the two prisoners, they decided to wait for a group of revolutionaries to storm the jail and free all 10,000 inmates, many of whom were political prisoners. The two prisoners then connected with the rescue team, which led them out of Iran through a border crossing into Turkey. The exploit was recounted in the book '''' by .  In 1986 this was turned into a two-part television mini-series (alternatively titled \"Teheran\") with the actor  playing the role of Colonel Simons and  as Perot.\n\nIn 1984, Perot's Perot Foundation bought a very early copy of , one of only a few to leave the United Kingdom. The foundation lent it to the  in Washington, D.C., where it was displayed alongside the  and the . In 2007, the foundation sold it to , managing director of  for $21.3&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;million) to be used \"for medical research, for improving public education and for assisting wounded soldiers and their families\". It remains on display at the National Archives.\n\nAfter  lost the power struggle at Apple and left to found , his angel investor was Perot, who invested over $20&nbsp;million. Perot believed in Jobs and did not want to miss out, as he had with his chance to invest in 's fledgling .\n\nIn 1988, he founded  in . His son, , eventually succeeded him as CEO. In September 2009, Perot Systems was acquired by Dell for $3.9&nbsp;billion ($&nbsp;billion).\n\n\n\n\n in his office in 1986]]\nAfter a visit to  in 1969, made at the request of the , in which he met with senior ese officials, Perot became heavily involved in the . He believed that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the U.S. involvement in the war, and that government officials were covering up POW/MIA investigations to avoid revealing a drug-smuggling operation used to finance a secret war in Laos. Perot engaged in unauthorized back-channel discussions with Vietnamese officials in the late 1980s, which led to fractured relations between Perot and the  and . In 1990, Perot reached an agreement with Vietnam's Foreign Ministry to become its business agent if diplomatic relations were normalized. Perot also launched private investigations of, and attacks upon,  official .\n\nIn Florida in 1990, retired financial planner , employing a famous quotation from the 1976 movie '''', funded a series of \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\" newspaper advertisements denouncing Congress for voting to give legislators pay raises at a time when average wages nationwide were not increasing. Gargan later founded \"Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out\" (THRO), which Perot supported.\n\nPerot did not support President , and vigorously opposed the United States' involvement in the 1990–1991 . He unsuccessfully urged Senators to vote against the war resolution, and began to consider a presidential run.\n\n\n\n and  at the third presidential debate at , October 19, 1992.]]\nOn February 20, 1992, Perot appeared on 's '''' and announced his intention to run as an independent if his supporters could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. With such declared policies as balancing the , favoring certain types of gun control, ending the outsourcing of jobs and enacting  via \"electronic \", he became a potential candidate and soon polled roughly even with the two major-party candidates.\n\nPerot denounced Congress for its inaction in a speech at the  in Washington, D.C., on March 18, 1992; he said:\n}}\n\nPerot's candidacy received increasing media attention when the competitive phase of the primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican  and Democrat  winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of  resentment toward establishment politicians. On May 25, 1992, he was featured on the cover of '''' with the title \"Waiting for Perot\", an allusion to 's play ''''.\n\nSeveral months before the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of election news, as his supporters began petition drives to get him on the ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat  and Republican . While Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization . Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for was intended to reduce the deficit, such as a  increase and cutbacks to .  In June, Perot led a  with 39% of the vote.\n\nIn July, the Perot campaign fell into disarray and his polls fell sharply.  The  was held on Monday, July 13 through Thursday, July 16, during which time there was increased media coverage of the general election. '''' reported that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by Perot's unwillingness to follow their advice to be more specific on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations. The '''' reported such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign s.  Perot's poll numbers had slipped to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Hamilton Jordan (a high-ranking manager in the Perot campaign) allegedly threatened to quit, but senior campaign officials denied this.\n\nOn July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist , who had worked with Rollins on the  campaign. Rollins would later claim that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the . Amid the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on ''Larry King Live'' that he would not seek the presidency. He explained that he did not want the  to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. Perot eventually stated the reason was that he received threats that digitally altered photographs would be released by the Bush campaign to sabotage his daughter's wedding. Whatever his reasons for withdrawing, his reputation was badly damaged. Many of his supporters felt betrayed, and public opinion polls subsequently showed a largely negative view of Perot that was absent before his decision to end the campaign.\n\nIn September, he qualified for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, he announced his intention to re-enter the presidential race. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3&nbsp;million of his own money. Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for -type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5&nbsp;million viewers.\n\nAt one point in June, Perot led the polls with 39% (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Just prior to the debates, Perot received 7–9% support in nationwide polls. The debates likely played a significant role in his ultimate receipt of almost 19% of the popular vote. Although his answers during the debates were often general, Frank Newport of  concluded that Perot \"convincingly won the first debate, coming in significantly ahead of both the Democratic challenger Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush\". In the debate, he remarked:\n}}\n\nIn the , he received 18.9% of the popular vote, about 19,741,065 votes, but no  votes, making him the most successful non-major-party presidential candidate in terms of share of the popular vote since  in the . Unlike Perot, however, multiple third-party candidates since Roosevelt had won electoral college votes:  in 1924,  in 1948, and  in 1968. Compared with Thurmond and Wallace, who polled very strongly in a small number of states, Perot's vote was more evenly spread across the country. Perot managed to finish second in two states: in , Perot received 30.44% of the voteahead of part-time resident Bush's 30.39% (Clinton won Maine with 38.77%); and in , Perot received 27.34% of the voteahead of Clinton's 24.65% (Bush won Utah with 43.36%). Although Perot did not win a state, he received a plurality of votes in some counties. His popular vote total is still by far the most ever garnered for a non-major-party candidate, almost double the previous record set by Wallace in 1968.\n\nA detailed analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described , 27% from self-described , and 53% coming from self-described moderates. Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with the bulk of the remainder drawing from the upper-middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually). Exit polls also showed that 38% of Perot voters would have otherwise voted for Bush, and 38% would have voted for Clinton. Though there were widespread claims that Perot acted as a \"spoiler\", post-election analysis suggested that his presence in the race likely did not affect the outcome. According to , the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A strong third-party candidate was a rare event. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups. In 2016,  described the theory that Perot was a spoiler as \"unlikely\".\n\nBased on his performance in the popular vote in 1992, Perot was entitled to receive federal election funding for 1996. Perot remained in the public eye after the election and championed opposition to the  (NAFTA). During the campaign, he had urged voters to listen for the \"\" of American jobs heading south to Mexico should NAFTA be ratified.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerot tried to keep his movement alive through the mid-1990s, continuing to speak about the increasing national debt. He was a prominent campaigner against NAFTA, and frequently claimed that American manufacturing jobs would go to Mexico. On November 10, 1993, Perot debated with then-Vice President  on the issue on ''Larry King Live'' with an audience of 16 million viewers. Perot's behavior during the debate was a source of mirth thereafter, including his repeated pleas to \"let me finish\" in his southern drawl. The debate was seen by many as effectively ending Perot's political career. Support for NAFTA went from 34% to 57%.\n\nIn 1995, he founded the  and won their presidential nomination for the . His vice presidential running mate was . Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an independent on many state ballots. Perot received 8% of the popular vote in 1996, lower than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by U.S. standards. He spent much less of his own money in this race than he had four years prior, and he also allowed other people to contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race. One common explanation for the decline was Perot's exclusion from the , based on the preferences of the Democratic and Republican party candidates. Law professor  filed a lawsuit over Perot's exclusion years later.\n\n\n\nIn the , Perot refused to become openly involved with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of  and . Perot was reportedly unhappy with what he saw as the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on ''Larry King Live'' four days before the election and endorsed  for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers.\n\nIn 2005, Perot was asked to testify before the  in support of proposals to extend access to technology to students, including making laptops available to them. He supported changing the process of buying textbooks by making s available and by allowing schools to purchase books at the local level instead of going through the state. In an April 2005 interview, Perot expressed concern about the state of progress on issues that he had raised in his presidential runs.\n\nIn January 2008, Perot publicly came out against Republican candidate  and endorsed  for president. He also announced that he would soon be launching a new website with updated economic graphs and charts. In June 2008, his blog launched, focusing on  (, , ), the U.S. national debt, and related issues. In 2012, Perot endorsed Romney for president again. Perot did not give any endorsements for the .\n\n\nPerot did not fit the usual political stereotypes; his views were seen as either pragmatic or populist, depending on the observer, and usually focused on his economic policy, such as balancing the budget, to gain support from both Democratic and Republican voters. Perot supported stricter gun control such as an  ban and supported increased research in . Perot was hesitant on covering the issue of  during his , but openly supported gay rights in . \n\nPerot spoke in favor of \"comprehensive national health care plan  one that would be akin to Medicare but for all Americans, not just the needy\". He also became known for his opposition to NAFTA; Perot believed that the power of corporations must be curbed, and saw the transfer of jobs to other countries as a symbol of corruption and inequality. He argued that such trade agreements only benefited the companies while robbing the US of its tax base and blue-collar jobs. Perot famously stated during the October 15 debate that NAFTA would create a \"\" on American jobs.\n\nThe populism of Ross Perot is hard to define and is a contested topic amongst political scientists. Perot was described as a \"classical populist\", liberal populist, \"telepopulist\" and also a \"third way\" populist. Neal Allen and Brian J. Brox argue that Perot was neither left nor right-wing ideologically, and focused first and foremost on promoting reforms of the political process and grassroots democracy; despite this, they also found some notable similarities between Perot and the left-wing populism of , and an average Perot voter had liberal leanings. \n\n described Perot's ideology as the \"populism of the centre\", presenting a distinct form of populism that significantly differed from left-wing and right-wing populist movements that appeared in the USA. Matthijs Rooduijn argues that Perot was an example of a liberal populist with centre-left leanings, noting his hostility to  - in the 1992 election, Perot stated that USA was in crisis caused by \"the decade of greed, the era of trickle-down economics\". In his famous ''The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics'' publication,  wrote that \"Perot represented a left and center-left populism\", in tradition of the  and . According to Judis, Perot \"represented the first clear repudiation of the neoliberal agenda.\"\n\nRegarding foreign policy, Perot was an outspoken opponent of the  and condemned Bush for the military intervention against Iraq. He instead promoted a more isolationist foreign policy, arguing that USA should focus on rebuilding its economy. In his 1992 presidential campaign, Perot stated that his \"highest foreign policy priority is to get our house in order and make America work again\".  He attacked Bush for his ties to Saddam Hussein prior to the invasion of Kuwait - according to Perot, the Bush administration covertly aided Hussein's chemical weapons programs and turned a blind eye to Iraqi plans against Kuwait, instructing  to greenlight Hussein's invasion on assumption that he would only seize Kuwait's northern oil fields. Perot claimed that Bush invaded Iraq because its actions threatened Bush's \"manhood\", and stated: \"off we go into the wild blue yonder with the lives of our servicemen at risk because of 10 years of stupid mistakes\".\n\nPerot also focused on anti-lobbying and political reform proposals - he favored a  against \" spending and waste\", elimination of s (PACs) to curb the influence of special interest groups, replacement of the  with a different balanced budget apparatus that would focus on limiting \"tricks, loopholes, and improper accounting procedures\" and a ban on  during elections. He also postulated a ban on lobbying.\n\nFrom 1992, Perot was a  activist, and a strong supporter of . He stated that poorer women in particular should have access to abortions via federal funding. From 2000, he was pro-choice reluctantly.\n\nPerot believed taxes should be increased on the wealthy, while spending should be cut to help pay off the national debt. Perot also believed the capital gains tax should be increased, while giving tax breaks to those starting new businesses.\n\n\nTogether with increased taxes on the wealthy, Perot also supported curbing entitlement payments and tax rebates to the affluent, and spoke in favor of eliminating the government's air fleet and other Washington perks for legislators, mocking the privileges that the US legislators enjoyed. He also argued that the government should protect the job base through intervention in the market. He spoke in support of creating a national industrial ministry based on the Japanese , which would increase state control over large businesses and direct their investment. Perot stressed that the government should ensure that both public and private investments would target the \"industries of the future\". When asked about objections to his plans from free-market advocates, Perot said: \"Don’t they realize that the biogenetics industry is the result\nof our federally funded research universities and the ?\"\n\nPerot was strongly opposed to , and was credited with marking the \"first clear repudiation\" of the neoliberal economic policies pursued by : \n\n\nIn his 1993 book ''Not For Sale at Any Price'', Perot expressed support for giving tax cuts for , as opposed to larger corporations. Additionally, Perot supported a  amendment, stating, \"spending should not exceed revenue for 27 consecutive years.\" On trade, Perot stated that  caused the trade deficit between Mexico and the United States and a loss of manufacturing jobs. His position on free trade and NAFTA became his defining campaign principle of both the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections. Perot argued: \"We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, ...&nbsp;have no health carethat's the most expensive single element in making a carhave no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.\"\n\n\nFor the 1992 election, Perot unveiled an ambitious budget program that would balance the budget through redistributive policies. The most prominent element of the plan was Perot's proposal to raise the income tax bracket of 4% wealthiest households from 31 to 33 percent, and to raise it further to 35 percent in the future. Other points included increasing the taxable portion of Social Security benefits from 50 to 85 percent for recipients with income of $25,000 or more, as well as implementing a tax on hitherto tax-free employer-paid health insurance, with Perot arguing that a tax-free workplace insurance creates an unfair advantage for those who receive health insurance through their job. The plan also called for doubling cigarette tax and increasing gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon; Perot explained that higher gasoline tax would help conserve energy and reduce pollution, but also advocated the creation of a special allowance for the workers disproportionately affected by the higher gasoline price. The plan also included massive cuts in military spending and scrapping the proposed space station project, which Perot derided as \"a vacation home in space\".\n\n\n, Ross Perot, Margot Perot and Suzanne Perot (in 1988)]]\nPerot and his wife Margot (née Birmingham; born November 15, 1933), a graduate of , had five children (, Nancy, Suzanne, Carolyn, and Katherine) and 19 grandchildren.\n\nPerot was raised in the  faith, but he converted to  and became a member of the  in late 1960s.

Ash connected this proposal to \"a concept that no matter how awesome its size, government can be made more effective by using management techniques.\"\n\nIn November 1969, the President's Domestic Council instructed Ash to study whether all federal environmental activities should be unified in one agency. According to a report by the U.S. EPA, during meetings in spring 1970, Ash at first expressed a preference for a single department to oversee both environmental and natural resource management, but by April he had changed his mind.

It needs to be preserved and protected by American patriots of every political stripe.”\n\nOn July 12, 2022, Murphy co-led the Select Committee's seventh public hearing with Representative . In her opening statement, she said, \"We will show some of the coordination that occurred between the White House and members of Congress as it relates to January 6th. And some of these members of Congress would later seek pardons.\" The hearing also focused on the role the far-right extremist groups  and  played in organizing the attack. Trump's December 19, 2020, tweet \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\" and its spread to his supporters was also discussed. To show the impact, the committee played audio recordings of its interview with an anonymous  employee who worked from 2020 to 2021 and was on the team responsible for the platform's content moderation policies. The employee said the tweet served \"as a call to action, and in some cases as a call to arms\" to Trump's supporters.\n\nIn Murphy's closing statement, she said: \"Our committee’s overriding objective is to fight fiction with facts. To create a full account for the American people and for the historical record. To tell the truth of what happened and why it happened. To make recommendations so it never happens again.

The first grants for studies were issued in October 2020. In March 2018, Murphy said that gun control might be approaching \"a tipping point\" because young people \"had to grow up where they don't know anything but school mass shootings.

I believe trade in goods and services is vital to advancing America’s economic and security interests. I believe protectionist measures are more likely to result in self-harm than self-preservation. I support a trading system that is rules-based.  These rules should help ensure U.S. companies rise or fall on their own merits, and don’t have to compete on an unfair playing field with foreign-based companies that mistreat workers, pollute the environment, steal intellectual property, or receive excessive government support.\"\n\nIn February 2022, Murphy was the only House Democrat to vote against the , a bill primarily focused on encouraging and strengthening American scientific and technological innovation and . Murphy said that while she supported many elements of the bill, \"the trade section of the bill includes problematic, poorly-vetted provisions and excludes sensible, bipartisan provisions that were part of the Senate-passed version of the bill\" according to Murphy. She said the bill \"does more to limit trade than to enhance trade, even though expanded trade helps far more American workers than it hurts, reduces the prices that American consumers pay for goods and services, and is a powerful weapon in our strategic competition with China.\"\n\n\nIn 2022, Murphy was one of 16 Democrats to vote against the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.\n\n\nMurphy and her husband, Sean, have two children.

His father, a , was the director of  the 's Asia program in New York during the 1990s, after working for the  in Zambia and . During the early 1980s, Geithner's father oversaw the Ford Foundation's  programs in Indonesia being developed by , Barack Obama's mother, and they met at least once in . Geithner's paternal grandfather, Paul Herman Geithner (1902&ndash;1972), immigrated with his parents to the United States in 1908 from , Germany.\n\nGeithner's mother, a  descendant, belongs to a  family. Her father, Charles Frederick Moore, Jr., served as vice-president of public relations for the  from 1952 to 1964, and advised President , as well as  and , on their respective presidential campaigns.

He served as an  at the , then as deputy assistant secretary for international  and  (1995&ndash;1996), senior deputy assistant secretary for international affairs (1996–1997), and assistant secretary for international affairs (1997&ndash;1998). He was  (1998&ndash;2001) under Secretaries  and , who are widely considered to have been his mentors.\n\n\n While at the Treasury Department, he helped manage financial crises in Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand.\n\n on November 25, 2008]]\n\nIn 2001, Geithner left the Treasury to join the  as a Senior Fellow in the International Economics department. He was director of the Policy Development and Review Department at the  from 2001 to 2003.\n\n\nIn October 2003, Geithner was named president of the . As president of the New York Fed, he served as Vice Chairman of the . In 2006, he became a member of the -based financial advisory body, the .\n\nIn 2005, Geithner expressed concern over Wall Street trading in , which ultimately contributed to the spread of the , though he did not pursue major reforms. In 2004, Geithner called on banks to \"build a sufficient cushion against adversity\", though in May 2007, he expressed support for the  accord, which critics, including  chairperson , argued would reduce the amount of capital banks would be required to hold to guard against losses. That month, in a speech at the , Geithner stated, \"Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk,\" but also cautioned that \"financial innovation and global financial integration do not offer the prospect of eliminating the risk of asset price and s, of manias and panics, or of shocks that could have systemic consequences.\"\n\nAs president of the New York Fed, Geithner was a central figure in the U.S. government's response to the .\n\nIn mid-March 2008, together with then-Treasury Secretary , Geithner arranged the rescue and  of , which was at risk of bankruptcy, to  for $2 per share (later raised to $10 per share).\n\n The Fed agreed to provide financing for the deal and support up to $30 billion of Bear Stearns's \"less-liquid assets\", despite some internal protests.\n In doing so, the New York Fed allowed Bear Stearns itself to calculate the value of assets acquired by the government and exposed itself to losses should those assets have declined in value, though JPMorgan agreed to absorb the first $1 billion in losses. The New York Fed stored these assets in the   and awarded s to the Wall Street   for management of the assets, with the intent of ridding itself of the assets within 10 years. In testimony before the , countering concerns that the rescue would invite  problems, Geithner argued that \"a sudden, disorderly failure of Bear would have brought with it unpredictable but severe consequences for the functioning of the broader financial system and the broader economy.\" Under questioning from Senator , Geithner denied involvement in setting the share price of JPMorgan's purchase of Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns and JPMorgan chief executives  and  testified that Geithner and   were aware of the amount being discussed and encouraged negotiators to keep the price low to avoid rewarding investors.\n\nIn the late summer of 2008, troubles at the financial services firm  were accelerating. In late August, the company announced that 1,500 employees (6% of its workforce) would be laid off, following 6,000 layoffs since June 2007. On September 9, Lehman's share price plunged 45% on fears that the company was facing billions of dollars in losses, and on news that a potential investment in the company by  had fallen through. Three days later, Geithner convened a meeting of Wall Street executives, Secretary Paulson, and  Chairman  to review exposure to Lehman's fortunes and discuss a possible liquidation of Lehman. Geithner indicated that the government would not save Lehman and urged the executives to cooperate on an industry solution, warning that the crisis could spread to their own firms should a deal not be reached. Government officials believed Lehman's collapse would be less dangerous than that of Bear Stearns, though Geithner sought to avoid that contingency nonetheless, citing the increase in market fragility by the time of Lehman's crisis. Nevertheless, no industry rescue materialized. , which had been in talks to purchase Lehman, pulled out after the government indicated it would not take on Lehman's risky real-estate assets, as it had with Bear Stearns. On September 15, Lehman announced that it would , making it the largest investment bank failure since  in 1990.\n\nGeithner, Paulson, and Bernanke later argued that Lehman's financial situation was too dire for the government to have legally rescued it. A team from  and  had estimated prior to Lehman's bankruptcy filing that Lehman's liabilities exceeded its assets by tens of billions of dollars (i.e., a negative ).\n\nGeithner was instrumental in government dealings with the  (AIG) insurance company. Over the summer of 2008, as  downgraded , AIG faced mounting demands to provide increased collateral to buyers of its s. Consequently, by the time of Lehman's failure in September, AIG was facing a rapidly increasing multibillion-dollar capital shortfall. On September 13, AIG chief  informed Geithner that the company would need to raise $40 billion and asked for government assistance in doing so. Geithner rejected the request for government funds and pressed AIG to find a private-sector solution to the company's . On the morning of September, Geithner reiterated this decision at a meeting of Wall Street executives and requested that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan organize an industry-based solution. By that evening, private-sector appetite for an AIG rescue has dissipated. Later that night, a consensus emerged at the New York Fed that AIG, with $500 billion in troubled credit-swap obligations, could not be allowed to fail. At a meeting of the Federal Reserve in Washington the next day, Geithner and Paulson proposed lending $85 billion to AIG, with all of AIG's assets held as collateral, in exchange for a 79.9%  stake in AIG and veto rights over dividend payments. Upon delivering this offer to AIG, Geithner informed Willumstad that there would be \"no negotiation\".\n\nAs a result of Lehman Brothers's failure, s with exposure to Lehman securities found themselves in distress on the day of Lehman's bankruptcy filing. One such fund was the . Due to the highly stable  (NAV) of money market funds ($1.00 per share), money market funds were extensively relied on by companies for regular cash demands (e.g., payroll). Following Lehman's bankruptcy filing, due to a slowdown in credit markets, the Primary Fund was unable to sell once  to meet rapidly mounting demands for the redemption of investments. Geithner's New York Fed had been informed of the worsening situation at 7:50 that morning, and the next day rebuffed a request from the Primary Fund to assist it in making payments. Unable to sell Lehman's securities held by the fund, the board of the Primary Fund announced that it would freeze redemptions for seven days and reduce its NAV to $0.97 per share, meaning a money market fund would  for only the second time in the industry's history.\n\nTo stabilize the financial market, Geithner proposed that the traditional s Goldman Sachs and  transform themselves into  to ensure continuing access to funding. Both banks completed the restructuring by September 21.\n\nGeithner believed, along with Paulson, that the Treasury needed new authority to respond to the financial crisis. Paulson described Geithner as a \"very unusually talented young man...[who] understands government and understands markets\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the , Geithner was rumored to be a possible choice for Treasury Secretary for both  and . On November 24, 2008,   announced his intention to nominate Geithner to be Treasury Secretary.\n\nDuring his confirmation, it was disclosed that Geithner had not paid $35,000 in  from 2001 through 2004 while working for the . The IMF, as an international agency, did not withhold payroll taxes, but instead reimbursed the usual employer responsibility of these taxes to employees. Geithner received the reimbursements and paid the amounts received to the government, but had not paid the remaining half which would normally have been withheld from his pay. The issue, as well as other errors relating to past deductions and expenses, were noted during a 2006 audit by the . Geithner subsequently paid the additional taxes owed. In a statement to the , Geithner called the tax issues \"careless\", \"avoidable\", and \"unintentional\" errors. Geithner testified that he used the software  to prepare his 2001 and 2002 returns, but that the tax errors were his own responsibility.\n\nOn January 26, 2009, the  confirmed Geithner's appointment by a vote of 60–34. Geithner was sworn in as Treasury Secretary by Vice President  and witnessed by President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nGeithner had authority over the second  of $350 billion from the $700 billion banking  passed by Congress in October 2008. Under the Financial Stability Plan, he proposed to create a new investment fund to provide a market for the legacy loans and securitiesthe so-called \"s\"burdening the financial system, using a mix of taxpayer and private money. He also proposed expanding a lending program that would spend as much as $1 trillion to cover the decline in the issuance of securities backed by consumer loans. He further proposed to give banks new infusions of capital with which to lend. In exchange, banks would be required to cut the  and sharply limit  and . The plan was criticized by   and , a former  .\n\nThe  (TARP) and  of  and  amounted a combined outflow of $620.3 billion in Treasury funds in the form of spending, investments, and loans. As of July 2016, $689 billion has been returned to the Treasury, primarily in the form of refunds provided by bailed-out companies and revenue from dividends.\n\n\n\n, 2009]]\nAlthough President Obama expressed strong support for Geithner, outrage over hundreds of millions of dollars in s (or  payments) by the , which had received more than $170 billion in federal bailout aid, undermined public support in early 2009. In March 2009, AIG paid $165 million in bonuses to its financial products division, the unit responsible for the company's  the year prior, following $55 million paid to the same division in December 2008 and $121 million in bonus payments to senior executives. In early November 2008, a joint committee of the , , and AIG concluded that the bonus payments, which were in contracts predating the government takeover, could not be legally stopped.\n\nDuring his time at the New York Fed and early in his tenure as Treasury Secretary, Geithner's aides had closely dealt with AIG on compensation issues, though Geithner indicated he was not aware of AIG's plans for bonus payments until March 10, 2009. On March 11, 2009, Geithner called , the AIG chief, to protest the bonus payouts and request that the contracting containing the bonuses be renegotiated. Later in March, Liddy requested that employees who received bonuses of more than $100,000 return half of the payment. At Geithner's urging, Liddy cut $9.6 million in payments to company's top 50 executives in half and tied the remainder to performance.\n\n\nIn November 2009, , the Treasury Department Inspector General responsible for oversight of TARP funds, issued a report critical of the use of $62.1&nbsp;billion of government funds to redeem derivative contracts held by several large banks which AIG had insured against losses. The banks received face value for the contracts although their market value at the time was much lower. In the report, Barofsky said the payments \"provided [the banks] with tens of billions of dollars they likely would have not otherwise received\". Terms for use of the funds had been negotiated with the  while Geithner was president.\n\nIn January 2010, Rep.  released a series of e-mails between AIG and the New York Fed. In these e-mails, the Fed urged AIG not to disclose the full details of the payments publicly or in its  filings. Issa pushed for an investigation of the matter, and for records and e-mails from the Fed to be subpoenaed. Rep. , Chairman of the , issued subpoenas for the records and scheduled hearings for late January.   said the Fed would welcome a full review of its actions regarding the AIG payments.\n\nGeithner and his predecessor, former Treasury Secretary , both appeared before the Committee on January 27. Geithner defended the bailout of AIG and the payments to the banks, while reiterating previous denials of any involvement in efforts to withhold details of the transactions. His testimony was met with skepticism and angry disagreement by House members of both parties.\n\n\n\nIn his book ''Bailout: How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street'',  argues that Geithner never had the intention to utilize the  as intended by Congress. Instead of providing relief for homeowners to avoid foreclosures, it was Geithner's plan that the bank should proceed with these foreclosures. Geithner said that he \"estimates\" that the banks \"can handle ten million foreclosures, over time\", and that HAMP \"will help foam the runway for them\" by “keeping the full flush of foreclosures from hitting the financial system all at the same time.\" As such, \"banks participating in the program have rejected four million borrowers’ requests for help, or 72 percent of their applications, since the process began\".  and  were among the banks that refused the most HAMP claims. As such, the program only helped 887,001 people out of the over 4 Million people that were originally estimated to be able to benefit from the program.\n\n\n at the opening session of the first U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue on July 27, 2009]]\n\nIn written comments to the Senate Finance Committee during his confirmation hearings, Geithner stated that the new administration believed  was \"manipulating\"  and that the Obama administration would act \"aggressively\" using \"all the diplomatic avenues\" to change China's currency practices. The Obama administration would pressure China diplomatically to change this practice more strongly than the  had done. The United States maintained that China's actions hurt American businesses and contributed to the financial crisis.\n\nShortly after assuming his role as Secretary of the Treasury, Geithner met in Washington with Chinese Foreign Minister . He told Yang that the U.S. attached great importance to  and that U.S.–China cooperation was essential in order for the world economy to fully recover.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, during a question-and-answer session following a speech at , Geithner was asked by a student whether Chinese investments in U.S. Treasury debt were safe. His reply that they were \"very safe\" drew laughter from the audience.\n\nGeithner co-chaired the high-profile  from July 27 to 28 in 2009 in Washington, D.C., and led the Economic Track for the U.S. side.\n\nIn September 2011, Geithner told a forum that China had \"made possible systematic stealing of intellectual property of American companies and have not been very aggressive to put in place the basic protections for property rights that every serious economy needs over time\", a rebuke of longstanding policy on the part of China to demand patents and other intellectual property from companies that sought to produce their products in China. He furthered that China was acting \"very, very aggressive in a strategy they started several decades ago\", which he defined as the ultimatum of transferring technology or being unable to produce products in China.\n\n\nIn summer 2010, ''The New York Times'' said Geithner \"is President Obama's point man in opposing the extension of the  for the wealthy after their Dec. 31 expiration. ... [Geithner] has cited the projected $700 billion, 10-year cost of the tax cuts, and nonpartisan analyses that they do not stimulate the economy because the wealthy tend to save the additional money rather than spend it. 'I believe there is no credible argument to be made that the purpose of government is to borrow from future generations of Americans to finance an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent,' [he] said in a recent speech.\"Calmes, Jackie (August 19, 2010). . ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 2010-08-20.\n\n\nGeithner was Obama's lead negotiator about the  and the increase in the 2013 .\nFor example, on December 5, 2012, Geithner confirmed leaks from the White House, Treasury Secretary Geithner told CNBC that the Obama Administration is \"absolutely\" willing to go over the fiscal cliff if Republicans refused to back off from their opposition to raising rates on wealthier Americans.\n\n\nGeithner weathered criticism early in the Obama presidency, when Congressman  (R-FL) suggested he should resign over the AIG bonus scandal, and Alabama Senator  said that Geithner was \"out of the loop\". Democrats largely joined Obama in supporting Geithner, and there was no serious talk of him losing his job.\n\nIn November 2009, Oregon Representative , speaking for himself and some fellow members of the Progressive Caucus, suggested that both Geithner and , the director of the , should be fired in order to curtail unemployment and signal a new direction for the Obama administration's fiscal policy. When Geithner appeared in front of the  that month, the ranking House Republican,  of Texas, said to the secretary, \"Conservatives agree that, as point person, you've failed. Liberals are growing in that consensus as well. Poll after poll shows the public has lost confidence in this president's ability to handle the economy. For the sake of our jobs, will you step down from your post?\" Geithner defended his record, suggesting Brady was misrepresenting the situation and overestimating popular disapproval of his job performance.\n\nIn June 2011, '''' criticized Geithner from the left, arguing that he was and is overly concerned with the deficit at a time when, following the , the government should be pursuing stimulus; and as a result, it is possible that the  was smaller than it could have been.\n\n\nGeithner left the Obama administration on January 25, 2013, and joined the  as a Distinguished Fellow. In March 2014, he became the president and managing director of , a  firm. In February 2016, it was announced that JPMorgan Chase would provide a line of credit to help Warburg Pincus executives invest in a new multibillion-dollar fund at the firm. In July 2023, he became chairman of Warburg Pincus.\n\nIn July 2018, '''' revealed that Mariner Finance, a company owned by the private equity firm of which Geithner is President, engaged in  behavior; capturing the sentiments of many former employees of Mariner Finance interviewed by ''The Post'', a former manager trainee at a Mariner Finance branch in Nashville characterized the company's business model as \"a way of monetizing poor people\".\n\nGeithner lectures at the , and is co-chair of the board of directors of the . His memoir of his time as Secretary of Treasury, '''', was published in May 2014. In the ''Handbook of Financial Stress Testing'' published in 2022, Geithner reflects back on financial stress testing and suggests ways forward. \n\nIn April 2016, he was one of eight former Treasury secretaries who called on the United Kingdom to remain a member of the  ahead of the .\n\n\nGeithner was portrayed by  in the  film '''', and by  in the  TV movie ''''.\n\n\n* (Board of Directors)\n\n\n*\n* (trustee)\n*\n*\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* , \"Eight Days: the battle to save the American financial system\",  magazine, September 21, 2009.\n*\n\n\n\n\n* | Warburg Pincus\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cahill is second generation Irish. His parents Eamon Cahill, a bricklayer and Eileen Cahill (nee O’Shaughnessy) a homemaker emigrated from Thurles, Co.Tipperary in the 1930s.\n\n\nCahill's first attempt to be elected to political office came in 1981, when he unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the  City Council. He ran again in 1987, at the age of 29, and was elected, where he served until 2003. He was reelected seven times and served as the chair of the finance committee.\n\nIn 1996, Cahill was elected as Norfolk County treasurer and served until 2002, when he began his campaign for state treasurer. In the 2002 Democratic primary, Cahill won a four-way race that included another candidate with the same surname, , and was elected state Treasurer in the general election.\n\nDuring Cahill's tenure as treasurer, the Massachusetts Lottery raised $7.2 billion.  Much of the money went to cities and towns in the form of local aid.\n\nOn July 7, 2009, ''The Boston Globe'' reported that Cahill was planning to leave the Democratic Party. On September 9, 2009, Cahill announced that he would run in the  as an independent.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his tenure as state Treasurer, Cahill was Chairman of the seven-member Board of Directors. He filed the legislation to reform the School Building Assistance Program  (SBA) in 2004. He worked with Governor  and the legislature to pass that legislation.\n\nPrior to the reform, Governor Romney said the SBA could be \"the next Big Dig.\"  As chair of the newly authorized  (MSBA) that received the prior SBA's responsibilities and debts, Cahill lead the initial years of the entity's activities. The MSBA has received praise from members of both parties for its fiscal management and effectiveness.\n\n\nAs Treasurer, Cahill served as Chairman of the nine-member Pension Reserves Investment Management (PRIM) Board, which is charged with the general supervision of the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund.\n\n\nCahill was Chairman of the five-member Lottery Commission, which was established by the Legislature in 1971 to provide local aid to Massachusetts cities and towns, as well as the state Arts Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council.\n\nAs of April 24, 2010,  FY10 sales are about $3.636 billion while FY09 sales during same period were $3.645 billion, a dropoff of 0.25 percent from year to year. The state's lottery will post record profits that year - $903 million - while lottery sales stayed even.  Cities and towns expect to receive an extra $44 million from lottery revenue.  Cahill has argued that the increased revenues are the product of spending cuts and new games. Since taking office in 2003, the Lottery has returned $7.3 billion in Local Aid to cities and towns.\n\n\nCahill is a vocal critic of the state's , often called \"Romneycare\" for Governor Mitt Romney, who signed the legislation into law, and which Cahill has called \"a fiscal train wreck\" that has \"blown a hole in the Commonwealth's budget.\"  While projected to cost the taxpayers only $88 million in 2006, the actual cost of the Bay State's healthcare system was over $4 billion.\n\n\n\n\nCahill ran as an independent for the office of , with former State Representative Paul Loscocco (R) as his running mate. He ran against incumbent Governor  (D) and the former Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare CEO  (R).\n\nSome pre-election polls showed that Cahill would draw votes from both Patrick and Baker equally, which showed his moderate and centrist position in the race. A '''' poll, published on September 26, 2010, showed Cahill to be drawing more votes from Patrick than from Baker.\n\nOn October 1, 2010, Loscocco announced he was withdrawing from the race for lieutenant governor and was endorsing Baker although it was too late to remove his name from the ballot as Cahill's running mate. Speculation immediately began over Loscocco's motives and the role of the Baker camp in the decision in which Baker joined Loscocco for the announcement.\n\nCahill filed a lawsuit that alleged that Loscocco had colluded with former Cahill Republican staffers to orchestrate his abandonment and e-mails exchanged between Loscocco's top advisor. The lawsuit sought to prevent the staffers from sharing proprietary information with the Baker campaign.\n\nCahill received 8% of the vote at the November 2, 2010 general election.\n\n\nAfter leaving the office of treasurer, Cahill became a securities broker in November 2011 with Compass Securities Corporation of Braintree, Massachusetts. Cahill ended his employment with Compass on March 7, 2017, shortly after he had paid off his $100,000 civil fine and completed his probationary period from a 2013 settlement with Massachusetts Attorney General  (see next section).\n\nIn July, 2017, Cahill began as the president and executive director of the Quincy Chamber of Commerce.  At the time, he stated that he had no interest in running for public office again.\n\n\nAdam Meldrum, Cahill's campaign manager during his 2010 campaign for governor, alleged that Cahill colluded with the Massachusetts Lottery, which is overseen by the state treasurer's office, to run an ad favorable to him during the campaign. The ad, paid for by the Commonwealth, described the Massachusetts Lottery \"the most successful state lottery America\" and \"consistently well-managed,\" which echoed themes from Cahill's gubernatorial campaign. Both Cahill and Massachusetts Lottery Director Mark Cavanagh denied the allegations. On October 18, e-mails released in conjunction with Cahill's lawsuit appeared to reveal that the campaign attempted to have the Lottery air a series of ads that praised the lottery's management. In the e-mails, Cahill's campaign media strategist Dane Strother told Meldrum to \"Get the Lottery immediately cutting a spot and get it up...Needs to focus on the Lottery being the best in the country and above reproach.\" Two days later, Cahill's senior adviser Scott Campbell wrote, \"I think the first thing is to figure out what/where/how we want to do this .. with Lottery people.\"\n\nOn April 2, 2012, Cahill was indicted by a  on charges that he used $1.65 million in Massachusetts State Lottery advertising to aid his campaign for governor in 2010. On December 12, 2012, a mistrial was declared in the corruption case after the jury failed to reach a verdict on two counts of conspiracy. Attorney General  said that she would review her options before she decided whether to pursue another trial.\n\nOn March 1, 2013, Cahill agreed to pay a $100,000 civil fine in exchange for the prosecution dropping its criminal corruption case against him.\n\nIn February 2017, Cahill posted to his FINRA Broker Check record that the \"monetary fine (sic) paid in full as of 1/27/2017 and on 2/1/2017 the court dismissed the case; all four charges were dismissed after the completion of the probation period.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n* 2006 campaign contributions\n* profile\n* Investment Banker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He is a co-founder of the Center for Full Employment And Price Stability at  and the founder of .\n\nMosler is a proponent and research financier of  . He was awarded an  by the , and in 2014 was appointed Visiting Professor at the , Italy.\n\nMosler has run as an independent for multiple offices including: , a  three times, and lieutenant governor. In 2018, he ran unsuccessfully for governor of the  as an independent.\n\n\nMosler attended the  where he graduated with a degree in economics.\n\nHe initially went on to work at the Savings Bank of Manchester in  in 1973. Next he went on to work in  for Bache and Co. before moving to . From there he would go on to work on , specifically,  NYC, and then  in Chicago.\n\n\nIn 1982 he founded a , Illinois Income Investors, where he was responsible for several strategies utilizing government securities, mortgage backed securities,  swaps and LIBOR caps, and financial futures markets. By the late 1990s, most of the firm had been largely turned over to his partners, as he had disagreements on the direction of some of its investments.\n\nWarren's hedge fund was informed by his developing theories. After his departure at the end of 1997, Warren's former business lost money when several dealers refused to make payments on credit default swaps on Russian debt. Separately, Warren attributed the crisis to the fixed exchange rate Russia had at the time.\n\n\n\nExcited to share his various economic theories, Warren met economist  through a referral from . At a meeting of Social Policy in NYC,  suggested Warren to seek out post-Keynesian economists , , and  to discuss his ideas. These  economists had been familiar with , and recognized the validity of Mosler's analysis. Laffer also his staff economist Mark McNary, who provided editorial and research assistance in Warren's self-published , \"Soft-Currency Economics\".\n\n\nAcademically, he is known for his writings on , an economic theory that describes the way  is created and used in modern economies. His unorthodox views have gained a substantial following among participants in Internet discussion groups and academics.\n\nIn 2010 he published ''Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy'' outlining errors that can be made in the development of policy and explains what he deems \"true\" as proper alternatives.\n\nIn recognition that his ''\"leadership in the field of economics is notable\"'' Mosler was awarded an  from  in 2014, after the Mosler Economic Policy Center (a center founded by him and aimed at encouraging education and research in new concepts and methods of economic policy analysis) had promoted a lecture about  at Franklin the year before.\n\nIn 2014 he became  at the .\n\n\nHe is attributed with creating Mosler's law dealing with fiscal policy of a nation during a recession. Specifically, Mosler's law states that \"[...] no financial crisis [is] so deep that a sufficiently large fiscal adjustment cannot deal with it.\" He stated that the recent recession could have been alleviated much quicker from a full payroll tax holiday that suspended FICA taxes (or massive government spending increases, depending on one's politics) until unemployment fell. He opposes overly high taxes since they discourage consumption within an economy but does agree a certain tax level is needed to guarantee citizens use the dollar as a currency. He is confident that inflation is a non-factor in his analysis given current procurement policy as long as there is sufficient excess capacity. In his theory the government has the complete ability to constantly expand net spending and guarantee consumption and growth. He supports unlimited FDIC deposit insurance for all bank deposits for US banks.\n\nHe stresses that federal spending is in no way constrained by tax revenues, therefore the government will always be able to make payments in its own currency, stating \"Federal Government checks don't bounce\". He goes on to state that any and all debt passed on to future generations will never be burdensome, since they will undoubtedly consume whatever is produced.\n\nHe developed much of his belief from his time as a hedge fund manager when many investors predicted the Italian government defaulting on bonds, whereas he predicted, correctly, that Italian government would not default and thus made considerable returns.\n\n\n\n; Healthcare\nMosler supports government funding for full-time employment with full health care coverage for employees and dependents, thus triggering all firms providing health care to remain competitive. He states health cannot be viewed as a production cost, therefore the government should fund for at least 90% of the cost paid by the firms. Finally, he supports issuing medical debit cards to all citizens, for a fixed amount. This covers any medical costs and any amount above this will be covered by \"catastrophe insurance\". At the end of every year, citizens would receive a portion of their unused medical debit card.\n\n; Energy\nIn a brief proposal, Mosler stated the energy crisis could be solved by lowering the speed limit nationally to 30&nbsp;mph. According to Mosler, this would cut gasoline consumption and pollution since automobiles run more efficiently at slower speeds, while also greatly increase the demand for public transportation. He states that such an initiative would eventually lead to a supply shock forcing prices down, and improve real terms of trade.\n\n; Housing\nMosler supports government purchases of houses in the foreclosure process from the bank at the lower of the fair market value or remaining mortgage balance. The government then would rent the house back to the original owner and after two years the house is put on the market with the original owner having the first rights of purchase.\n\n; Taxes\nMosler supports eliminating the income tax and replacing it with a real estate tax to \"anchor the currency\". He also supports eliminating tax advantages for any savings accounts, since he states savings do not increase investments necessarily. He supports luxury taxes being used to limit the consumption of undesirable goods.\n\n\n\nIn February 2009, Mosler declared his candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission to run for the office of President of the United States as an independent. In April 2010, he withdrew to run for a , briefly as a Democrat, but ultimately as an independent. In the final tally he received 0.98% of the vote.\n\nMosler has run unsuccessfully three times for U.S. Virgin Islands delegate to the United States Congress; his last congressional race was in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, Mosler ran for lieutenant governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands as an independent, but quit the race early due to a difference of opinion with his running mate . In 2018, he ran unsuccessfully for  as an independent candidate, coming in fourth with 4.7% of the vote.\n\n\n\nMosler developed several luxury sports cars and , including the  and the . Starting in 1985, his cars were marketed by startup company Consulier, later renamed .\n\nHis models were marked by excellent performance and high speeds. Mosler was so confident about one of his models, the Consulier GTP, that he offered a bounty of $25,000 to anyone who could beat it in a race. '''' took up the gauntlet and defeated his car. Mosler noted that the model used in the race was a worn-out Consulier and even so offered to pay if he was allowed to use his own driver and replace the brake pads. ''Car and Driver'' refused. Mosler subsequently offered the challenge once more for a higher bounty of $100,000 and held an event at Sebring where the Consulier again proved to be far quicker than any other road car.\n\nIn the 1990s he developed environmentally friendly vehicles including both electric cars and composite-bodied automobiles. The company was sold in June 2013.\n\nMosler also designed his own  that he prides on being much lighter, faster, and more fuel-efficient than other models. He is operating a unique 'tandem' four-hulled ferry that doesn't promote sea sickness to take passengers from St. Croix to St. Thomas.\n\n\n\nAround 2010, Mosler relocated to the  in order to participate in a government-sponsored economic growth initiative. In 2013, the ''New York Times'' described Warren as \"transitioning into an active retirement\". Warren currently lives full time in  in the .\n\n\n* \"Maximizing Price Stability in a Market Economy,\" ''Journal of Policy Modeling'', January 2017, co authored by Professor Damiano Bruno Silipo, Università della Calabria \n* \"Critique of John B.

Istvan owns a 68 acre island in Nova Scotia, Canada in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\nAfter publishing ''The Transhumanist Wager'', Istvan began actively promoting transhumanism and other futurist issues via speeches, media interviews, activism and his writings.\n\nIstvan's writings and ideas on transhumanism, philosophy, atheism and futurist issues have been featured in major media Istvan has also written for '''', ''New Scientist'', ''Salon'', ''TechCrunch'', ''The Daily Dot'', ''International Business Times''  ''Singularity Hub'', ''TechInsider'', ''Newsweek'', ''Futurism'' and ''''.\n\nIstvan gives talks on futurist and transhumanist topics, which include speeches at the ,  (Global Future Council), Congreso Futuro, Moogfest, the 's annual conference, and '''' Camp Alphaville conference.\n\nHe appeared in the 2016 documentary ''''.\n\n\nIn October 2014, Istvan announced that he was \"in the very early stages of preparing a campaign to try to run\" for U.S. President in 2016. He stated that his goals would be to support scientists in \"overcoming human death and aging within 15–20 years\" to encourage Americans to embrace \"radical technology and science\" and to set up safeguards against dangers including potential abuse of such technology.\n\nIn October and November 2014 interviews, Istvan explained that he aimed to unify the transhumanist community, which otherwise was splintered, and to establish a single voice. He said great changes in society could happen and that Transhumanism could provide ideas, safeguards and policies. He said the aim for a Transhumanist Party would be to get onto as many state ballots as possible.\n\n\nIn March 2015, Istvan reported progress in organizing a campaign and explained his wish to get major candidates to address issues. He hoped to be included in some debates, at least with third parties. He himself had funded nearly all of his campaign's expenses to date and he noted donations were needed.\n\n\nIstvan helped to publicize his campaign in late 2015 by driving a bus shaped like a casketthe \"\"across the United States. Istvan planned the bus tour to raise awareness of life extension. At the end of the Immortality Bus tour, Istvan delivered a \"Transhumanist Bill of Rights\" to the U.S. Capitol. His 20-point platform includes a universal basic income, increased funding for space travel and taking money from the military and putting it into science and medicine.\n\nIn February 2016, it was reported that Istvan was likely to vote , placing himself \"somewhere between Bernie and Hillary in terms of political ideologies\", but later in 2016 he also wrote articles supporting Libertarian presidential candidate . On October 15, 2016, Istvan stated on his social media accounts that he would be voting for himself.\n\nIstvan was not on the ballot in any state, though he claimed to have substantial potential  backers.\n\n\nIstvan emphasized science, technology, longevity, transhumanism and Libertarian values in his California gubernatorial run, along with support for . He suggested basic income could be paid for without raising taxes through a \"Federal Land Dividend\". Under this program, the government would allocate monthly payments to households by leasing out federal land. In his debut editorial for '''' magazine, he argued that reparations for harm caused to marijuana users during the federal government's  may be appropriate. He suggested reparations could be paid as tax credits or through the sale of federal lands, so as not to put further burden associated with the drug war on taxpayers.\n\n\nIn December 2017, Istvan announced he was considering running for the 's Presidential nomination. In March 2019 during an interview on the Bread and Circuses podcast, Istvan told Caleb Salvatore and Nick Koehler that he was again considering a run for President. Istvan announced a run for the  on November 19.\n\n\nIstvan states that in the 21st century, as modern man confronts the finitude of life, everyone faces a Transhumanist Wager, a concept that is explored in . The Transhumanist Wager follows from a life philosophy Istvan calls Teleological Egocentric Functionalism (TEF). Istvan summarizes the Transhumanist Wager as follows:\n\n\n\nIstvan is the creator of the concepts of Theistcideism, Omnipotism, the AI Imperative, the Singularity Disparity, Speciation Syndrome, Post-earthism, Delayed Fertility Advantage, and Jethro's Window, a possible solution to the . Istvan is also a populizer of AI Day, the transhumanist olympics, the Jesus Singularity, cryothanasia a robot AI President, and quantum archaeology (technological resurrection). Istvan proposed and developed the concept of a Longevity Peace Prize at the XPRIZE Foundation in 2019. Writing for The New York Times opinion section, Istvan argued conservatives should consider supporting artificial wombs to move the abortion debate forward. Istvan also argued to allow surfing during the Covid lockdowns in The New York Times Opinion section.\n\nIstvan authored an article entitled \"Transhumanism and Theistcideism\" for publication in '''' (2017). Istvan wrote the short fictional story \"The Jesus Singularity\" on a religious AI that goes rogue and destroys the world. It was published in '''' magazine.\n\nIstvan has a chip implanted in his hand and consulted with the U.S. Navy on broad about the use of the implant in humans. According to Istvan's novel, the three laws of Transhumanism are:\n\n# A transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else.\n# A transhumanist must strive to achieve omnipotence as expediently as possibleso long as one's actions do not conflict with the First Law.\n# A transhumanist must safeguard value in the universeso long as one's actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws.\n\n\nWithin the transhumanist community, reactions to Istvan's U.S. Transhumanist Party have ranged from enthusiastic to sharply critical. Some transhumanist critics, such as Peter Rothman, have questioned whether the Transhumanist Party adds value to the overall goals of transhumanism.\n\n\nIstvan resides in  with his wife, who is a physician, and his daughters. He identifies as an atheist.\n\nIn February 2015, he helped launch BiZoHa, the world's first free-thinker orphanage, in Mukhoya, , western .

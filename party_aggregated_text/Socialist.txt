Known for his outspoken anti-war views, Benson and his running mate  received 590,524 votes, 3.2% of the total vote in the election., US Election Atlas.org Retrieved July 4, 2010.\n\n\nBenson was born in , on November 6, 1871. His father, Adelbert L. Benson, was a factory worker during Allan's boyhood, later becoming a , while his mother, Rose Morris Benson, died when Allan was an infant.\"Biographical Sketch of Allan L. Benson,\" ''The Michigan Socialist,'' no. 11 (September 22, 1916), pg. 1. Allan lived with his grandfather until the age of 12. His grandfather was a farmer in .\n\nAt the age of 15, Benson's father's mill burned and he was forced to give up his aspiration of attending college and becoming a lawyer. Benson left home and took a job in a chair factory, later working in a paper mill.\n\nBenson only attended one year of high school, but he nevertheless took the state examination to become a school teacher and passed, earning a certificate to teach in a district school. He became involved in a physical conflict with some farm boys in the first school to which he was assigned and was apparently forced to resign his post.\n\n\nIn April 1891, Benson left , for , where he went to work for the Peninsular Car Company as a machine hand. He began to regularly visit the offices of the various Detroit newspapers in search of a position and was finally hired as a reporter, earning the starvation wage of $6 a week.\n\nBenson moved to  in the fall of 1891 to assume the position of managing editor of the ''Washetaw Daily Times.'' He continued to move up the ranks of the newspaper profession, moving to a position as telegraph editor of the ''Chicago Inter-Ocean'' in the spring of 1892. He later worked as telegraph editor of the '''' and as a writer in San Francisco.\n\nBenson subsequently worked as managing editor of the '''', the '''', and the ''''.  He married Mary Hugh in , , on November 19, 1899, and had four children.\n\n\nDuring his tenure as a newspaper editor, Benson read an encyclopedia article on the topic of socialism written by an English  and was thereby won over to the socialist movement.David A. Shannon, ''The Socialist Party of America: A History.'' New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 91. He joined the staff of the '','' a mass circulation socialist weekly published in , and his editorials for that publication made him into a nationally recognized figure among radical American political activists.Shannon, ''The Socialist Party of America,'' pg. 90.\n\nBenson was particularly outspoken in his opposition to , championing a proposal to ban American entry from  unless participation was first approved by a national referendum of the American people. Benson further demanded that anyone voting in favor of participation should be the first enlisted in the army, implemented through a signed rather than . This demand was criticized by many of the  faithful as impractical, including leading party voice , who dismissed Benson's demand as \"positively wild\".\n\nBenson's position on American entry into World War I found a receptive audience among the Socialist Party's rank and file. As the Socialist Party Presidential and Vice-Presidential nominations for 1916 were made by a  vote of a membership rather than via a , Benson's status as a widely published anti-war writer made him a frontrunner for the party's nomination. With  opting out of the 1916 presidential race so that he could attempt to win election to the  from his home state of , Benson was left free to run against labor leader  of Pennsylvania and  of . Benson captured a majority of referendum votes cast by party members to become the Socialist Party's Presidential nominee.\n\nThe 1916 campaign was run by Benson and the Socialist Party primarily through the newspapers, with Benson concentrating his fire on the country's \"\" campaign. The campaign proved manifestly unsuccessful, with Benson capturing only half of the nearly 1 million votes cast for Gene Debs in the 1912 campaign. Benson and his running mate  ultimately received 590,524 votes, or 3.2% of the total vote.\n\n\n\nAlthough Benson had been an anti-war voice in the years leading up to World War I, in April 1917, the United States entered the conflict simultaneous with the Socialist Party's passage of a manifesto placing equal blame on Germany and the allies and vowing continued opposition to the conflict.\n\nBenson broke his silence in June 1918 in '','' the new pro-war incarnation of the socialist weekly ''Appeal to Reason'', with an article titled, \"What's Wrong with the Socialist Party?\"Allan L. Benson, \"What's Wrong with the Socialist Party,\" ''The New Appeal,'' whole no. 1,176 (June 15, 1918), pg. 1. In this article Benson condemned as \"anarchist\" the idea that \"the workers have no country,\" and accused  with having conducted unceasing  within the party against their opponents. In order to be respected, the Socialist Party \"must be respectable,\" Benson declared, blaming the party's ills on \"anarchists, falsely regarded as Socialists, aided and abetted by certain foreigners whose naturalization papers should be cancelled while they themselves are deported to the countries from which they came.\"\n\nHaving remained an inactive member of a party for a year, Benson formally severed his connection with the organization around the first of July 1918 in order to join a new pro-war political rival, the .\"Why Benson Resigned,\" ''The New Appeal,'' whole no. 1,179 (July 6, 1918), pg. 2. In the open letter announcing his decision, Benson declared that \"nothing worse could happen to the world than to be placed under the heel of German imperialism\" and indicated his refusal to participate further in an organization which \"places the belligerents upon a parity.\" Benson repeated his charge that the Socialist Party had come to be dominated by \"foreign-born leaders,\" assisted by an \"anarchistic,  minority.\"\n\nFollowing his switch of organizational affiliation, Benson was hired by managing editor  as a staff writer for ''The New Appeal,'' which had evolved into the semi-official organ of the Social Democratic League. Benson remained in this capacity through the end of the war.\n\nFrom January 1919 through June 1921, Benson was the publisher of a new monthly magazine called ''Reconstruction,'' subtitled \"A Herald of the New Time.\" The publication used a newsprint format similar to '''' and '''' and advanced political line slightly to the right of those journals. Frequent contributors included former Socialists  and . A substantial run of the publication is present in the collection of the .\n\nBenson's later years were spent housebound in . Several months before his death, Benson wrote a letter to cartoonist  explaining his plight:\n\n\n\"I am suffering not from pernicious  but from the injury to my nervous system that this disease did when four dumbbell doctors (who were supposed to be good) did not recognize it for what it was and let it go until I collapsed, was in bed for six months and have scarcely been able to walk across the room ever since. I have been away from the house but seven times in nine years, for an hour's motor trip each time, and have not now been out in almost two years. I am in more or less distress all the time, but I read almost constantly and thus enjoy myself pretty well considering the circumstances.\"\n\n\nBenson died in , on August 19, 1940.\n\n\n* ''Confessions of Capitalism.''

A lawyer who had served as Milwaukee City Attorney from 1910 to 1916, Hoan was a prominent figure in  politics and Milwaukee's second Socialist mayor.  His 24-year administration remains the longest continuous Socialist administration in United States history.  A panel of 69 scholars in 1993 ranked him among the ten best mayors in American history.\n\n\n\n\nHoan was born in , on March 12, 1881, to Daniel Sr. and Margaret Augusta (née Hood) Hoan. Hoan entered the  in  in the fall of 1901.Daniel W. Hoan, \"Socialism at the Wisconsin Capital,\" ''Social Democratic Herald'' [Milwaukee], vol. 5, no. 43, whole no. 246 (April 18, 1903), p. 2. He helped organize the University of Wisconsin Socialist Club in November 1901, a group which consisted of just four members during its first year. Hoan served as secretary of that organization for the 1902/03 academic year.\n\nIn 1908 Hoan passed the Wisconsin state bar exam and became a lawyer. A member of the , Hoan moved to  where he worked closely with , the editor of '''', a socialist newspaper, in trying to persuade the city to adopt radical reforms. These included  of utilities, urban renewal programs, and free legal, medical and educational services.\n\n\nOn October 9, 1909, the non-religious Hoan, a member of the , married Agnes Bernice Magner (1883–1941), a devout Catholic. She was active in her husband's political campaigns and in women's organizations including the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. They had two children:\n* Daniel Webster Hoan III (1910–1988)\n* Agnes, later Mrs. Agnes B. Steininger (1915–1993)\n\nDaniel Hoan, a widower since December 28, 1941, married Gladys Arthur Townsend (1901–1952), a divorced Indiana schoolteacher two decades his junior, on April 7, 1944, in . His second wife Gladys died in 1952, leaving him a widower once again. He did not remarry.\n\n\n\nHoan began his political career with his election to city attorney for Milwaukee in 1910. He won the election by a plurality of more than 7,300 votes out of about 59,000 votes cast over  and  opponents. This was the same year  was elected mayor of Milwaukee as the first socialist leader of a major city in the . Over the next six years, Hoan clamped down on the corruption of public officials.\n\nIn 1916 Hoan was elected as mayor of Milwaukee. He remained mayor for 24 years, the longest continuous Socialist administration in United States history. Part of the reason for Hoan's electoral success was his break with the rest of the Socialist Party on the issue of United States entry into the . The Socialist Party opposed entry; Hoan did not. Instead, as mayor, he organized the Milwaukee County Council of Defense on April 30, 1917.\n\nAs mayor, Hoan developed a reputation for honest and efficient government.Melvin G. Holli. ''The American Mayor: The Best & The Worst Big-City Leaders''. University Park, Pa.: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999, p. 75. He implemented progressive reforms, including the country's first public housing project, , started in 1923. He also led the successful drive towards municipal ownership of the stone quarry, street lighting, sewage disposal, and water purification.\n\n presented with a basket of flowers in honor of his 70th birthday by Mayor Hoan and his daughter, Agnes]]\n\nDuring Hoan's administration, Milwaukee implemented the first public bus system in the United States. This was prompted by dangerous accidents: pedestrians were run over by street trolleys that ran down the middle of the road. Among the victims of such streetcar accidents was Hoan's fellow Socialist, , who was killed in 1929.\n\nAt the May 1932 convention of the Socialist Party, Hoan ran for national chairman of the party against incumbent . In addition to , Hoan garnered the support of the young  \"militant\" faction and the radicals around , but this bloc was insufficient to unseat Hillquit, who won reelection by a vote of 105–86.\n\nHoan was president of the  in 1934 and 1935.\n\nAfter ten years on the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, Hoan pointedly had his name removed from consideration at the special party convention of 1937. Although Hoan provided no formal reason, convention participants speculated in an  story which made the front page of '''' that Hoan did not wish to be placed in the position of supporting the national organizing drive of the  (CIO) in opposition to the .Associated Press, \"Hoan Quits Office in Socialist Party: Unwilling to Endorse CIO, He Leaves Executive Committee After Ten Years,\" ''New York Times,'' vol. 86, whole no. 28,919 (March 29, 1937), p. 1.\n\n\n\nHoan was defeated in the Milwaukee mayoral campaign of 1940 and the next year left the Socialist Party and joined the . He ran unsuccessfully for governor in  and . In 1948 he was unsuccessful in his attempt to once again become mayor of Milwaukee when he was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate, . Hoan remains the last sitting mayor of Milwaukee to be defeated in a reelection bid.\n\nA highway system was started under his administration, but federal funding was scarce. The system was later expanded to include the , which was completed in 1972 but not opened to the public until 1977.\n\nToday, Hoan is remembered as one of the best mayors in Milwaukee's history. A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the  saw Hoan ranked as the eighth-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. In 1999, Holli wrote, \n\n\n\nHoan died on June 11, 1961, at 80 years old, from a heart ailment, in Milwaukee.\n\n\nHoan's mayoral papers reside with the , Milwaukee.

Dobbs met the Russian revolutionary leader  when he visited  shortly before Trotsky's death in 1940.\n\nDobbs served as mentor and advisor to a young , while Hoffa was making his rise within the Teamsters, eventually becoming its president in 1957. Dobbs primarily inspired Hoffa with his view that the capitalist system was a  struggle, where power, rather than morality, was the primary factor determining the eventual outcome.\n\nFor opposing , he and other leaders of the SWP and the Minneapolis Teamsters were convicted of violating the , which made it illegal to \"conspire to advocate the violent overthrow of the United States Government\".

Zeidler, a member of the , is the most recent  of a large American city.\n\n\nZeidler was born in  on September 20, 1912. He studied at both the  and , but was never able to  due to ill health. He became a socialist because of socialism's emphasis on peace and improving the conditions for workers. \n\nIn an interview, Zeidler said he chose the ideology of socialism in 1933 \"because of several things in its philosophy. One was the brotherhood of people all over the world. Another was its struggle for peace. Another was the equal distribution of economic goods. Another was the idea of cooperation. A fifth was the idea of democratic planning in order to achieve your goals. Those were pretty good ideas\". He distanced himself from the beliefs of , especially communism linked in any way to the . Indeed, he was (and remained) an active Lutheran, a religious commitment which he saw as being fulfilled rather than contradicted by his Socialist activism.\n\nLater, however, he credited his adoption of socialism to reading  literature, with the majority being written by  and  during the .\n\nZeidler became an active member of the  (YPSL), the  of the , he later became the leader of the Milwaukee branch of the  during the 1930s.\n\n\n\nZeidler was elected   in 1938 on the  ballot line (the Socialist Party and Progressives were in coalition in Milwaukee at that time).\n\nHe was elected to a six-year term on the  (a non-partisan office) in 1941, just after his brother  was elected Mayor of Milwaukee in 1940. In 1942, Frank Zeidler was the Socialist nominee for , receiving 1.41% of the vote in a six-way race. He was re-elected to the Milwaukee School Board in 1947.\n\nAfter two years in office, Carl Zeidler enlisted in the Navy at the height of World War II. Carl was killed at sea when his ship was lost and became a local hero, helping to pave the way for his younger brother to become mayor. In 1948 Frank Zeidler ran for mayor in a crowded field of fourteen candidates and won, undoubtedly aided by the familiarity of his surname.Frank Zeidler's Milwaukee, by John McCarthy, ''Next American City'', Winter 2007 The large field of candidates was due to Mayor  declining to seek re-election in 1948. Among the candidates that year was attorney , a Democrat who later went on to win election to Congress in 1954. Zeidler was re-elected in 1952 and 1956, but declined to seek another term in 1960, citing health reasons.\n\nZeidler was Milwaukee's third Socialist mayor (after  [1910-12] and  [1916-40]), making Milwaukee the largest American city to elect three Socialists to its highest office (a fact that singer  pointed out in the 1992 film '''').\n\n\nDuring Frank Zeidler's administration, Milwaukee grew industrially and never had to borrow money to repay loans. During this period, Milwaukee nearly doubled its size with an aggressive campaign of municipal annexations: large parts of the  and most of the  were annexed to the city. The park system was upgraded. Zeidler spearheaded planning and construction of the beginning of Milwaukee's freeway system, and turned it over to  in 1954. A transportation advocate claims that Zeidler always maintained that the projected Milwaukee freeway system should have been built and that the city's competitiveness had been compromised by the failure to complete the planned system.\n\nZeidler's plans for the city were only a partial success. Milwaukee doubled in area through annexation and it experienced very little decline in population during a period of American urban decline starting in the 1960s and lasting until about 1990. Suburban residents and governments fiercely resisted annexation and the politics of regional Milwaukee became highly factional. An attorney who sued to block annexation claimed Zeidler planted listening devices in his office. Zeidler, angry about the resistance to his plans, said in 1958: \"The city consults with suburban governments, but we do not believe they have reason for existing.\"\n\nZeidler faced the vexing issue of race relations as Milwaukee's  population tripled during the 1950s. Zeidler was a vocal supporter of the civil rights movement and his opponents tried to exploit this to their advantage. Zeidler's political enemies spread false rumors that Zeidler had put billboards in the South asking blacks to come north. Many workers in Milwaukee were threatened for supporting Zeidler. One manufacturer even threatened to fire employees who voted for Zeidler. Zeidler cited bad personal health and the race issue as reasons for not running for re-election in 1960.\n\nA 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the  ranked Zeidler as the twenty-first-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.\n\n\nAfter leaving office, Frank Zeidler worked as a , as  for , and served in the administration of  . As a leader of the Public Enterprise Committee, Zeidler was a frequent and severe critic of his successor, . He supported a number of unsuccessful attempts to defeat Maier in subsequent elections.\n\nZeidler was instrumental in re-forming the  in 1973, and served as its National Chair for many years. He was the party's presidential nominee in 1976, getting on ten state ballots. The party had 400-600 members nationwide at the time. Zeidler agreed to run when other leading members of the SPUSA declined to do so. He and his running mate, , received 6,038 votes, including approximately 2,500 in .\n\nOn July 26, 2004, Zeidler appeared at the  in Milwaukee to welcome delegates to the convention.\n\nHe died on July 7, 2006, aged 93, and was interred at  in Milwaukee. His mayoral and personal papers are archived at . Several additional boxes of his papers are archived at the  of the .\n\n\nZeidler wrote several books, including not only treatises on , , socialism, and , but , renditions of four of 's plays into present-day English, and . His 1961 memoir of his time as mayor, ''A Liberal in City Government'', was published in 2005 by Milwaukee Publishers LLC, a local company formed for the purpose.\n\nOn June 13, 1958, Zeidler was the first person to receive an honorary doctorate from the , which now sponsors the Frank P.

He was also frequently a member of the party's Political Committee, which handled day-to-day operations of the organization.\n\nIn 1940, Breitman married Dorothea Katz (1914–2004).\n\nHe was four times the SWP's candidate for the  for , running in , , , and .\n\nFollowing the departure of  and his political associates to form a new , Breitman was named editor of the SWP's weekly paper, ''.'' He held that post from 1941 until 1943, when he found himself  into the U.S. Army and sent to . In March 1946 he participated in the first post-war conference of the , held in . He was arrested at this meeting along with other participants but quickly released, owing to his American citizenship.\n\nAfter the war, Breitman was once again named editor of ''The Militant,'' handling primary editorial duties from 1946 to 1954. During this time, he wrote copiously, publishing over 500 articles in ''The Militant'' from 1947 to 1955.\n\nIn 1954, the Breitmans moved to , where for the next 13 years they served as District Organizers for the SWP. There George and Dorothea Breitman helped to organize the \"Friday Night Socialist Forum\" (later called the \"Militant Labor Forum\"), a weekly lecture series that attracted participants a broad range of activists from labor, radical, and black liberation groups. To pay the bills, Breitman worked as a printer and proofreader for the ''.'' As such, he was a member of the .\n\nBreitman returned from Detroit to New York in the late 1960s to take over management of  the SWP's publishing arm, . In that capacity, he served as editor of a 14-volume collection entitled '''', which was published from 1969 to 1979. During his time at the helm of Pathfinder, Breitman was instrumental in the publication of various collections of writings by SWP leading light  and a pioneering selection of writings by , entitled ''Malcolm X Speaks'' (1965).\n\nAlthough politically a child of the 1930s, Brietman was deeply influenced by the radical movements of the 1960s and 70s seeing them as a harbinger of a coming social revolution which he prophesied would have a \"combined character\" being both a socialist revolution of the working class against capitalism merged with the struggles and demands of \"specially oppressed\" people: Blacks, Latinos and other nationally oppressed people; women, gays and others, groups Brietman pointed that were, like the American population in general, overwhelmingly working class.  Brietman described the radical movements of that period as constituting a \"New Radicalization\"\nthat was deeper and broader than the ones he described as occurring before the Civil War among abolitionists and small farmers and later among industrial workers and socialists during the turn of the century in the era of the Bolshevik Revolution up through the 1930s.  He thus saw that it portended the prospect of a great social upheaval.  In a certain sense he adopted and translated into Old Left and orthodox Marxist terms, New Leftist ideas.  For this he was denounced as a  like revisionist by sectarian Marxists,  while others viewed his ideas as entirely correct, even visionary, which explored the issues Marcuse addressed on a deeper level, reconciling them with revolutionary Marxism, whose adherents, in the words of Lenin, must at all times be \"tribunes of the people\" responding to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression.\n\nIn the late 1970s Breitman opposed what he saw as a growing fixation of the SWP's top leadership on the  leadership of the , and  became involved in a factional opposition group in the SWP beginning in 1981. This disagreement over the direction ultimately led to Breitman's expulsion from the SWP in 1984.\n\nDespite ill health, Breitman played a leading role in the foundation of the , which sought to unify U.S. supporters of the Fourth International. Continuing his editorial activities, he was a contributing editor of the group's journal, ''.''Lubitz and Lubitz, \"George Breitman,\" p. 3.\n\nBreitman used several pseudonyms over the course of his life, including most famously \"Albert Parker,\" but also \"\"Philip Blake,\" \"Drake,\" \"Chester Hofla,\" \"Anthony Massini,\" \"John F.

Brisben took part in the Mississippi  of 1964where he was briefly jailedand in several -sponsored activities in Alabama from 1965 to 1967.

Zeidler's vice presidential running mate in 1976 for the Socialist Party USA. The  reported that Brisben traveled via  across the country speaking to small groups of socialists. On the trail, he was described as speaking with \"an unpretentious charm which combines a down-home practicality and a simple humor.\" Only on a handful of state ballots because of the difficulty and expense of the process, Zeidler/Brisben received 6,038 votes. That election was the first time the Socialist Party had run a presidential candidate since the 1956.\n\n\nBrisben and his running mate Bill Edwards were nominated at the 1991  convention.

An ardent , she was a longtime  who became a  and switched to the  in 1985. After serving as 's foreign policy adviser in his , she became the first woman to serve as .\n\nShe was known for the \"\", which advocated supporting  regimes around the world if they went along with Washington's aims. She believed that they could be led into democracy by example. She wrote, \"traditional authoritarian governments are less repressive than revolutionary autocracies.\" She sympathized with the  during the , while Reagan took the other side in support of British prime minister .\n\nKirkpatrick served in Reagan's cabinet on the , Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Defense Policy Review Board, and chaired the  Commission on Fail Safe and Risk reduction of the Nuclear Command and Control System. She wrote a syndicated newspaper column after leaving government service in 1985, specializing in analysis of United Nations activities.\n\n\nKirkpatrick was born in , on November 19, 1926, the daughter of an oilfield , Welcher F. Jordan, and his wife, Leona (née Kile). She attended Emerson Elementary School in Duncan, and was known to her classmates as \"Duane Jordan.\" She had a younger sibling, Jerry. At 12, her father moved the family to , where she graduated from Mt. Vernon Township High School. In 1948, she graduated from  of  after receiving her associate degree from  in , which was then only a two-year institution. \n\nIn 1968, Kirkpatrick earned a  in  from Columbia University.\n\nShe spent a year of postgraduate study at  at the , which helped her learn . She was fluent in .\n\nWhile she ultimately became a , as a college freshman in 1945 she joined the , the youth wing of the , influenced by her grandfather who was a founder of the  and  parties in . At Columbia University, her principal adviser was , a . As Kirkpatrick recalled at a symposium in 2002:\n\nIt wasn't easy to find the YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of activities in Columbia, Missouri. We had an  rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it was likely to be in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.\n\n\n\nIn 1967, she joined the faculty of  and became a full professor of government in 1973. She became active in politics as a  in the 1970s, and was involved in the later campaigns of former  and Democratic  . In addition to Humphrey, she was close to , who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in  and . Like many in Jackson's circle she became identified with . \n\nOpposed to the candidacy of  in 1972, she joined with  and others in co-founding the , which sought to warn Americans of 's growing military power and the dangers that the organization believe were represented to the United States in the  treaty. She also served on the Platform Committee for the Democratic Party in 1976.\n\nKirkpatrick published articles in political science journals reflecting her disillusionment with the Democratic Party with specific criticism of the  of Democratic President . Her most well known essay, \"\", was published in '''' magazine in November 1979. In the essay, Kirkpatrick mentioned what she saw as a difference between authoritarian regimes and the totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union; sometimes, it was necessary to work with authoritarian regimes if it suited American purposes: \"No idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated Americans than the belief that it is possible to  governments, anytime and anywhere, under any circumstances&nbsp;... Decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits. In Britain, the road [to democratic government] took seven centuries to traverse&nbsp;... The speed with which armies collapse, bureaucracies abdicate, and social structures dissolve once the autocrat is removed frequently surprises American policymakers.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe piece came to the attention of Ronald Reagan through his National Security Adviser . Kirkpatrick then became a foreign policy adviser throughout Reagan's  and presidency and, after his election to the presidency, Ambassador to the United Nations, which she held for four years. '''' writes that until then, \"she had never spent time with a Republican before.\"\n\nOn the way to her first meeting with Reagan, she told Allen, \"Listen, Dick, I am an  Democrat and I am quite concerned that my meeting Ronald Reagan on any basis will be misunderstood.\" She asked Reagan if he minded having a lifelong Democrat on his team; he replied that he himself had been a Democrat until he was 51, and in any event, he liked her way of thinking about American foreign policy.\n\nKirkpatrick was a vocal advocate of US support for the military regime in El Salvador during the early years of the Reagan Administration. When four US churchwomen were murdered by Salvadorean soldiers in 1980, Kirkpatrick declared her 'unequivocal' belief that the Salvadorean army was not responsible, adding that 'the nuns were not just nuns. They were political activists. We ought to be a little more clear about this than we actually are.' After the release of declassified documents in the 1990s, New Jersey congressman  stated that it was 'now clear that while the Reagan Administration was certifying human rights progress in El Salvador they knew the terrible truth that the Salvadoran military was engaged in a widespread campaign of terror and torture'.\n\nShe was one of the strongest supporters of 's military dictatorship following the March 1982 Argentine invasion of the 's , which triggered the . Kirkpatrick had a \"soft spot\" for Argentina's General  and favored neutrality rather than the pro-British policy favored by Secretary of State . Kirkpatrick, who, according to British UN Ambassador Sir , was very mixed up with Latin American policy, even went as far as supporting the Argentinian dictatorship by urging the Reagan Administration to act as outlined as in the  of 1947, which stated that an attack against one state in the hemisphere should be considered an attack against them all.\n\nBritish ambassador  allegedly characterized her in a  as \"more fool than fascist&nbsp;... she appears to be one of America's own-goal scorers, tactless, wrong-headed, ineffective, and a dubious tribute to the academic profession to which she [expresses] her allegiance.\" The  ultimately decided to declare support for the British, making her vote for .\n\nAt the , she delivered the \"Blame America First\" keynote speech, which renominated Reagan by praising his administration's foreign policy while excoriating the leadership of what she called the \" Democrats\" (the Democrats had just held their convention in San Francisco) for the party's shift away from the policies of  and  to a more strident antiwar position for which the left-wing of the Democratic Party had pushed since the . It was the first time since the 1952 speech from  that a non-party member had delivered the Republican Convention's keynote address.\n\nKirkpatrick, a member of the National Security Council, did not get along with either Secretary of State Haig or his successor, . She disagreed with Shultz, most notably on the  in which she supported skimming money off arms sales to fund the n  while Shultz told Kirkpatrick that it would be an \"impeachable offense\" to do so because of the massacres perpetrated by that group. Shultz threatened to resign if Kirkpatrick was appointed National Security Adviser. Kirkpatrick was more closely allied with Secretary of Defense  and head of the CIA  on the issue.\n\n, for example, referred to her as the \"Chief sadist-in-residence of the Reagan Administration\" and went on to criticize what he called the hypocrisy of supporting brutal military regimes that showed no respect for human rights or democracy while claiming to be protecting the region from communism. Author Lars Schoultz has argued that her policy was based on her belief that \"Latin Americans are pathologically violent\" and goes on to criticize that as a prejudice with no factual basis.\n\n\n.]]\nKirkpatrick said, \"What takes place in the  more closely resembles a mugging than either a political debate or an effort at problem-solving.\" Still, she finished her term with a certain respect for the normative power of the United Nations as the \"institution whose majorities claim the right to decidefor the worldwhat is legitimate and what is illegitimate.\" She noted that the United States had increasingly ignored that significance and became increasingly isolated. That was problematic, because \"relative isolation in a body like the United Nations ''is'' a sign of impotence,\" especially given its ability to shape international attitudes. She was ambassador to the UN during the September 1, 1983, Soviet shooting down of , near . It had carried 269 passengers and crew including a sitting congressman,  (D-GA). She played before the Security Council the audio of the electronic intercept of the interceptor pilot during the attack, and the Soviet Union could no longer deny its responsibility for the shootdown. \n\nKirkpatrick was a board member of the American Foundation for Resistance International and the National Council to Support the Democracy Movements, intended to help bring down Soviet and East European Communism. Along with Vladimir Bukovsky, Martin Colman and Richard Perle, she worked to organize democratic revolutions against communism. \n\nAccording to , on a visit with American dignitaries, Soviet human rights activist  said, \"Kirkpatski, Kirkpatski, which of you is Kirkpatski?\" When others pointed to Kirkpatrick, he said, \"Your name is known in every cell in the \" because she had named Soviet political prisoners on the floor of the UN. Kirkpatrick had said she would serve only one term at the UN and stepped down in April 1985.\n\n\nKirkpatrick was a staunch supporter of . During her ambassadorship at the United Nations, she considered its frequent criticism and condemnation of the  as holding Israel to a double standard, which she attributed to hostility and regarded as politically motivated. In 1989, Mohammed Wahby, press director of 's Information Bureau, wrote to the '''', \"Jeane Kirkpatrick has, somehow, consistently opposed any attempt to resolve the \". However, in a 1989 , Kirkpatrick warned Secretary of State  and Bush not to get involved in the conflict because any intervention would fail.\n\nKirkpatrick frequently expressed disdain for what she perceived to be disproportionate attention towards Israel's at the expense of others' conflicts. Despite this, during her tenure as UN Ambassador, she supported several resolutions condemning Israel.\n\n President  issued a press release upon her death: \"She will be fondly remembered for her unwavering and valiant support of the State of Israel and her unequivocal opposition to , especially during her tenure at the United Nations. She was always a true friend of the .\"\n\n\nComparing  and  regimes, she said:\n* \"Authoritarian regimes really typically don't have complete . Authoritarian regimes typically have some kind of traditional economy with some . The  left ownership in private hands, but the state assumed control of the economy. Control was separated from ownership but it was really a command economy because it was controlled by the state. A command economy is an attribute of a totalitarian state.\"\n\nExplaining her disillusionment with international organizations, especially the , she stated:\n* \"As I watched the behavior of the nations of the U.N. (including our own), I found no reasonable ground to expect any one of those governments to transcend permanently their own national interests for those of another country.\"\n* \"I conclude that it is a fundamental mistake to think that salvation, justice, or virtue come through merely human institutions.\"\n* \"Democracy not only requires equality but also an unshakable conviction in the value of each person, who is then equal. Cross cultural experience teaches us not simply that people have different beliefs, but that people seek meaning and understand themselves in some sense as members of a cosmos ruled by God.\"\n\nRegarding , she said:\n* \"As I read the utopian socialists, the scientific socialists, the German Social Democrats and revolutionary socialistswhatever I could in either English or FrenchI came to the conclusion that almost all of them, including my grandfather, were engaged in an effort to change human nature. The more I thought about it, the more I thought this was not likely to be a successful effort. So I turned my attention more and more to political philosophy and less and less to socialist activism of any kind.\"\n\n\nIn April 1985, Kirkpatrick became a Republican, a move which '''' called her \"only recourse\" after her speech at the . She returned to teaching at Georgetown University and became a fellow at the , a  , and a contributor to the ''''. In 1993, she cofounded , a public-policy organization. She was also on the advisory board of the , a group that works against what it regards as a  bias in , with its emphasis on  , and .\n\nKirkpatrick briefly considered running for president in 1988 against , because she believed he was not tough enough on Communism. Kirkpatrick endorsed Senator  of , who was the runner-up to Bush. Despite a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses, Dole's campaign quickly faded after he lost the New Hampshire primary in February 1988. Kirkpatrick was an active surrogate campaigner for Dole even as he was losing, as was her old foe, , who endorsed Dole after ending his own 1988 campaign several days before the New Hampshire primary. \n\nAlong with  co-directors  and , she called on the  to issue a formal declaration of war against the \"entire fundamentalist  network\" the day after the  on the . In 2003, she headed the US delegation to the . Kirkpatrick was appointed to the Board of Directors of  in 2004. It was revealed after her death that in 2003, she was sent as a US envoy, to meet an Arab delegation and attempt to convince them to support the ; she was supposed to argue that pre-emptive war was justifiable, but she knew that it would not work and instead argued that  had consistently gone against the UN. However she described  as \"a bit too interventionist for my taste\" and felt that what she described as \"moral imperialism\" was not \"taken seriously anywhere outside a few places in Washington, D.C.\"\n\n\nAccording to a spokesperson at the , Kirkpatrick was a Presbyterian. On February 20, 1955, she married Evron Maurice Kirkpatrick, who was a scholar and a former member of the  (the World War II–era predecessor of the ). Her husband died in 1995. They had three sons: Douglas Jordan (1956–2006), John Evron, and Stuart Alan.\n\nShe had been diagnosed with heart disease and had been in failing health for several years.

His running mate on the ticket is .\n\nWhite's political program calls for the expropriation and nationalization of all major banks and corporations, the end to all US wars abroad, including the Israeli war with the Palestinians and the US-NATO proxy war in Ukraine, a new democratic system of worker control over companies, and the establishment of social rights of the working class. \n\nWhite's call for social rights include the right to: a livable income, a safe working environment, clean water and air, food, safe and affordable housing, high quality education, transportation, healthcare, culture, retirement, and full democratic rights.\n\n\nJerome White was raised in a working-class family in .

He has been active in the party’s interventions in the working class since the 1980s, providing on-the-spot reporting of strikes at Greyhound Bus, Hormel, Eastern Airlines, Pittston Coal, Caterpillar, Verizon, UPS, public schools in Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, West Virginia and Oklahoma, the oil refineries and many others.  \n\nWhite authored a book, published in 1990, entitled ''Death on the Picket Line: The Story of John McCoy''. The book, an , treats the killing of a militant , McCoy, as well as the history of the  (UMW) in . He has written extensively on the history of the American working class, including the 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain, the 1934 Minneapolis Teamsters strike and Flint Sit-downs in 1936-37. \n\nWhite has served as the labor editor of the  since its founding in 1998. As a WSWS reporter, White has written extensively on the , and has interviewed autoworkers in , , , and . \n\nWhite is also the Editor of the ''World Socialist Web Site Autoworkers Newsletter''. White announced the creation of the ''WSWS Autoworker Newsletter'' in July 2015, as a means to oppose \"UAW Nationalism\", pension cuts, poverty wages, and unemployment, and to call for the abolishment of the two-tier wage system, and develop international unity among autoworkers. The Autoworkers Newsletter played a substantial role in the \"No vote\" carried out by Fiat Chrysler workers and Nexteer workers in 2015 against the proposed contract.\n\nThe newsletter and the WSWS played a role in rallying support for GM workers in Silao, Mexico who were fired in 2019 for refusing to work overtime during strike by GM workers in the US and encouraging workers to shut down the auto industry protect autoworkers from the spread of COVID-19 in March 2020. The Autoworker Newsletter supported Mack Trucks worker Will Lehman who ran as a socialist candidate for United Auto Workers president in 2022 and Lehman’s lawsuit opposing the disenfranchisement of UAW members. \n\nIn 2023, White interviewed autoworkers and commented extensively on UAW President Shawn Fain’s “stand up strike” and the UAW labor agreements, which have opened the door for massive job cuts in the global auto industry. White denounced Fain’s endorsement of US President Biden, writing a comment titled, “The UAW apparatus backed the war criminal in the White House.”   \n\nDuring his early years in the Workers League, White also served as editor of its youth newspaper, the Young Socialist, and interviewed  in  in Louisiana in 1985. In 1974, the 16-year-old black youth was arrested and falsely accused of murder in a state conspiracy backed by Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

White was also active in Detroit's Committee Against Utility Shutoffs (CAUS) and organized hearings on fires in low-income neighborhoods.  CAUS, 23 March 2010. \n\nIn October 2013, White participated in the Socialist Equality Party’s protest against the threatened sale of artwork at the Detroit Institute of Arts and gave introductory report to the Workers Inquiry into the Bankruptcy of Detroit and the Attack on the DIA & Pensions on February 15, 2014.\n\nOn January 24, 2021, White was invited to speak on the Jimmy Dore Show to discuss the strike by Hunts Point produce workers in New York City. The YouTube personality brought White on without informing him that Dore’s previous guest was a member of the Boogaloo Boys, an armed far-right militia group that actively participated in ’s  and the . \n\nWhite began by saying the Socialist Equality Party opposes Dore’s strategy and “the idea that somehow there can be unity of left and right.” He continued, “There is a historical precedent. The Nazis called themselves ‘revolutionists’ and opponents of the international Jewish capitalist conspiracy. This has nothing to do with left politics. My movement, the Socialist Equality Party, is seeking to build a genuine movement of the working class. We are above all internationalists. The right wing promotes nationalism.”\n\n\nIn February 2024, White was selected to be the vice presidential candidate of the Socialist Equality Party (SEP) in the . During his campaign he visited various picket lines, anti-genocide protests, and funerals for workers killed in industrial workplaces.\n\nIn May 2024, White visited the site of the Francis Scott Key Bridge disaster in Baltimore, where 6 migrant workers died.\n\nAlso in May 2024, White attended the funeral of Tywaun Long, an autoworker at Michigan’s Dearborn Truck Assembly plant, who collapsed at work and later died of a heart attack.\n\nWhite gave a speech at a vigil for Gaza organized by the holocaust survivor Rene Lichtman. In his remarks, White stated, \"this genocide would not be possible without the military, political and financial support of the Biden administration and both parties in Washington.\"\n\nWhite also spoke at the July 24 demonstration held by the Socialist Equality Party in Washington D.C. against Netanyahu.\n\n\nIn 1996, White ran as the first presidential candidate for the newly-formed  (SEP) with vice-presidential candidate Fred Mazelis., Marxists.org., Michigan Daily, 6 September 1996.\n\nIn 2006, White ran for 's 12th  district seat as an SEP candidate. , Portland Independent Media Center, 14 May 2006.\n\nIn 2008, White ran as the SEP presidential candidate with vice-presidential candidate ., World Socialist Web Site, 3 November 2008. , Tribe, 19 September 2008., Ballot Access News, 29 October 2008. The write-in campaign was accompanied by a redesign of the Socialist Equality Party's website, which would rehost articles written by both candidates for the ., Independent Political Report, 18 September 2008., Michigan Daily, 24 September 2008.\n\nReporting on a campaign speech by White at the University of Michigan, the student newspaper wrote, “White said he is running to provide a political alternative to Obama and McCain, both of whom support the bailout. ‘Both of them are preparing to issue a joint statement urging the passage of what would be the greatest theft of public assets in the history of the country, to bail out financial speculators at the direct expense of working people,’ he said. ‘We’re running in order to make the case for a socialist alternative. If the resources of the country have to be mobilized to avert a financial catastrophe, then the great financial institutions should be put under the public and democratic ownership of the working people.’”\n\nIn 2012, White ran as the SEP presidential candidate with vice-presidential candidate Phyllis Scherrer. The campaign was announced from the Cooper Tire factories in , where workers were locked out for contesting contract negotiations. The White-Scherrer ticket was on the ballot in , , and had  status for . White visited , ,  and  to campaign for socialism and an international working-class movement.\n\nWhite's 2012 presidential campaign kept five core components: , ,  rejection of austerity, opposition to   and the assault on , and opposition to the political subordination of the  to the  and . White's campaign indicted the  that arose from the  as evidence of the failure of capitalism to organize society in a productive manner, and called for the building of an independent socialist movement and called for social rights to , , , and .\n\nIn 2016, White ran as the SEP presidential candidate with vice-presidential candidate Niles Niemuth. In an interview with , White explained, “For years social opposition has been channeled back into the Democratic Party, which has presented itself as a “people’s party,” pointing to role of the leaders of the 2003 anti-war protests, the Occupy Wall Street and the Sanders campaign. “There is no national solution for American workers or Greek workers, we’re confronting huge transnational corporations that can only be fought through the international unity of the working class.” \n\nSpeaking to the Legal Reader during 2016 campaign, White was asked to explain the difference between the Socialist Equality Party and those groups the SEP refers to as the “pseudo left.” White explained that the Socialist Equality Party traces its roots back to the political struggle by Leon Trotsky for revolutionary internationalism against Stalinist bureaucracy’s nationalist and reactionary program of “socialism in a single country.” After World War II, the orthodox Trotskyists, White said, had to fight and ultimately defeat political tendencies associated with Michel Pablo and Ernest Mandel, which tried to liquidate the Fourth International into the existing Stalinist, Social Democratic, bourgeois nationalist and trade union apparatuses.“So, we call them ‘pseudo-left’ not as an epithet but to describe those organizations that present themselves as sort of anti-establishment or even in some cases socialist, but whose politics are pro-war and articulate the interests of the top ten percent, that layer of the upper middle class that does have some real concerns over how wealth is being distributed at the top and is really concerned about, you know, getting its own cut of the spoils. But they’re not looking to overthrow capitalism.”\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Prior to that, he served as national vice chair from 2011 to 2013. Soltysik also served as state chair of the  from its chartering in 2011 to 2017.\n\n\nSoltysik was born in . After high school, Soltysik became a professional musician until his mid-thirties. Speaking of that period, he said in an interview: \"I was incredibly self destructive, self absorbed, and almost entirely focused on instant gratification. By the time I reached my early 30s, I felt as if I had bottomed out. Substance abuse had taken a heavy toll on my health, both physically and mentally, and I found myself in a position where I was essentially starting from scratch.\" \n\nSoltysik then returned to higher education and graduated from  and then went on to earn an  degree at . He later said \"I came to the conclusion that, if the first half of my life was spent tearing humanity down, the second half of my life would be dedicated to making a substantive difference.\" On June 28, 2020, Soltysik died after a prolonged struggle with .\n\n\nSoltysik was elected as the male co-chair of the Socialist Party USA for the 2013–2015 term at the party's 2013 national convention. He was also the chair of the Socialist Party of California.\n\nIn , Soltysik was one of eight candidates in the primary for . Under California's  system, the top two candidates from the primary, regardless of party, advance to the general election. Soltysik finished in 7th place with 2.5% of the vote.\n\nIn October 2015, Soltysik filed a Federal lawsuit against the California Secretary of State because he had been required to list \"Party Preference: None\" on the 2014 primary ballot; the California election law allows candidates to list only a party preference of a qualified party or \"None\" on the ballot, and the Socialist Party was not a qualified party in California. Soltysik argued that restricting which parties could appear on ballots was unconstitutional. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California dismissed the case in April 2016, finding that the ballot-label restrictions were justified by California's desire to protect the integrity of their elections. Soltysik appealed and the case was heard by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In 2018, they reversed the District Court's decision and  the case. Shortly after this, Soltysik's health began to worsen and he withdrew his lawsuit.\n\nIn April 2016, Soltysik was interviewed on  regarding growing support for socialism in the United States.\n\n\n\n | status           = Announced October 17, 2015\nLost Election November 8, 2016\n | affiliation      = \n | headquarters     = 11713 Avon Way #15, Los Angeles, CA 90066\n | key_people       =\n | receipts         =\n | slogan           =\n | homepage         = \n}}\n\nOn October 17, 2015, Soltysik announced he was running for president, and the Socialist Party USA formally nominated him as their candidate, with Angela Walker as his running mate, at their November 2015 conference in . The party did not have automatic ballot access in any state, although Soltysik and Walker were on the ballot in Colorado, Michigan, and the U.S. overseas territory of Guam.\n\nSoltysik differentiated himself from other socialist candidates, in that he intended to overthrow capitalism rather than reform it, and sought to build a new system from the \"bottom up.\" He advocated for the abolition of most governmental organizations, such as the , , and . When asked how the United States would defend itself if all these organizations were eliminated, he responded that he believes every threat the US faces is created by their foreign policy. He also believes that one cannot serve as president \"without becoming a war criminal\" and suggested his first course of action upon taking office would be to \"fire ourselves on the first day.\"\n\nSoltysik made several campaign stops, including in  and , , , , , primarily focusing on meeting with and building local networks of community activists.\n\nWhile campaigning, Soltysik often spoke critically of his political opponent , telling the '''' that \"[Sanders] has had a long history of support for war, and he has also had a healthy support for Israel, which we tend to see as an  state,\" although he did acknowledge that Sanders' campaign offered \"opportunities to introduce different voices into the dialogue.\"\n\nThe Soltysik/Walker campaign received endorsements from multiple socialist and progressive organizations, including Anarcha-transfeminism, the Red Party, and \n\n\nIn June 2016, the campaign filed for ballot access in the state of . Under Illinois law, 25,000 valid signatures are required to secure ballot access for independent and non-qualified alternative parties. However, this requirement is only enforced if a petition's validity is challenged by an Illinois voter. The Soltysik-Walker campaign, which submitted one signature, was challenged by \"dissident\" Green Party member Rob Sherman, who had also challenged the Socialist Party, Constitution Party and Justice Party petitions in 2012. Because the Soltysik campaign was found to have an insufficient number of signatures, it was removed from the Illinois ballot. On July 28, 2016, the Michigan chapter of the  nominated Soltysik-Walker and gave the ticket its first ballot line in 2016. In September 2016, the campaign became the only alternative party to be listed on the ballot in .\n\n\nThe Soltysik/Walker ticket received approximately 2,700 total votes including write-ins.

Later, he was one of the founders of the , the precursor of the .\n\n\nThomas ran for office five times in quick succession on the Socialist ticketfor  in , for mayor of New York in , for  in 1926, for  in 1927, and for mayor of New York again in 1929. In , he ran for the US Senate in New York and polled almost 200,000 votes, then the second-best result for a Socialist candidate in New York state elections; only  polled more votes, almost 300,000 in  when he ran for .\n\nThomas's political activity also included attempts at the US presidency. Following 's death in 1926, there was a leadership vacuum in the Socialist Party. Neither of the party's two top political leaders,  and Hillquit, was eligible to run for president because of their foreign birth. The third main figure, , was occupied as mayor of . Down to approximately 8,000 dues-paying members, the Socialist Party's options were limited, and the little-known minister from New York with oratorial skills and a pedigree in the movement became the choice of the 1928 National Convention of the Socialist Party.\n\nThe 1928 campaign was the first of Thomas's six consecutive campaigns as the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party. As an articulate and engaging spokesman for , Thomas had considerably greater influence than the typical . Although most upper- and middle-class Americans found socialism unsavory, the well-educated Thomaswho often wore three-piece suits and looked and talked like a presidentgained grudging admiration.\n\nThomas frequently spoke on the difference between socialism, the movement he represented, and  and revolutionary . His early admiration for the  had turned into energetic . (Some revolutionaries thought him no better;  criticized Thomas on more than one occasion.)\n\nHe wrote several books, among them his passionate defense of World War I s, ''Is Conscience a Crime?'', and his statement of the 1960s  consensus, ''Socialism Re-examined''.\n\n\n\nAt the 1932 Milwaukee convention, Thomas and his radical pacifist allies in the party joined forces with  and a faction of young Marxist intellectuals called the  in backing a challenger to National Chairman Morris Hillquit. While Hillquit and his cohort retained control of the organization at this time, this action earned the lasting enmity of Hillquit's New York-based allies of the so-called . The diplomatic party peacemaker Hillquit died of tuberculosis the following year, lessening the stability of his faction.\n\nAt the 1934 National Convention of the Socialist Party, Thomas's connection with the Militants deepened when he backed a radical  authored by his longtime associate from the radical pacifist journal ''The World Tomorrow'', . The Militants swept to majority control of the party's governing National Executive Committee at this gathering, and the Old Guard retreated to their New York fortress and formalized their factional organization as the , complete with a shadow Provisional Executive Committee and an office in New York City.\n\nThomas favored work to establish a broad Farmer–Labor Party upon the model of the Canadian , but remained supportive of the Militants and their vision of an \"all-inclusive party\", which welcomed members of dissident communist organizations (including  and ) and worked together with the  in joint  activities. The party descended into a maelstrom of factionalism in the interval, with the New York Old Guard leaving to establish themselves as the , taking with them control of party property, such as the  '''', the English-language '''', the , and the party's summer camp in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1937, Thomas returned from Europe determined to restore order in the Socialist Party. He and his followers in the party teamed up with the Clarity majority of the National Executive Committee and gave the green light to the New York Right Wing to expel the Appeal faction from the organization. These expulsions led to the departure of virtually the whole of the party's youth section, who affiliated to the new Trotskyist . Demoralization set in and the Socialist Party withered, its membership level below that of 1928.\n\nIn April 1938, Thomas was the center of national controversy when he came to  to defend labor organizers' free speech and challenge the political machine of Mayor . Hague was a close ally of Franklin Roosevelt and controlled federal patronage in the state. Though denied a permit for political reasons, Thomas came anyway to speak at an outdoor rally. The police arrested him as soon as he got out of his car. As the officers prepared to expel him from the city, Thomas quipped, \"So this is Jersey justice\". People across the political spectrum, including the 1932 and 1936 Republican presidential nominees,  and , criticized Hague for his suppression of free speech and Roosevelt for his silence about the incident. Thomas and Landon became good friends as a result of the incident.\n\n\n meeting in 1937 (by ) ]]\nThomas was initially as outspoken in opposing  as he had been with regard to the First World War. Upon returning from a European tour in 1937, he formed the Keep America Out of War Congress, and spoke against war, thereby sharing a platform with the non-interventionist . In the 1940 presidential campaign he said Republican  was the candidate of \"the Wall Street war machine\" and that he \"would take us to war about as fast and about on the same terms as Mr. Roosevelt\".\n\nIn testimony to Congress in January 1941 he opposed the proposed  program of sending military supplies to Great Britain, calling it \"a bill to authorize undeclared war in the name of peace, and dictatorship in the name of defending democracy\". He said that the survival of the British Empire was not vital to the security of the United States, but added that he favored helping Britain to defend herself against aggression.\n\nAfter  on December 7, 1941, a bitter split took place in the Socialist Party regarding support for the war; Thomas reluctantly supported it, though he thought it could have been honorably avoided. His brother and many others continued their pacifist opposition to all wars. Thomas later wrote self-critically that he had \"overemphasized both the sense in which it was a continuance of World War I and the capacity of nonfascist Europe to resist the s\".\n\nThomas was one of the few public figures to oppose   following the attack on Pearl Harbor. He accused the ACLU of \"dereliction of duty\" when the organization supported the forced mass removal and incarceration. Thomas also campaigned against , environmental depletion, and anti-labor laws and practices, and in favor of opening the United States to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution in the 1930s.\n\nThomas was an early proponent of birth control. The birth-control advocate  recruited him to write \"Some Objections to Birth Control Considered\" in ''Religious and Ethical Aspects of Birth Control'', edited and published by Sanger in 1926. Thomas accused the Catholic Church of hypocritical opinions on sex, such as requiring priests to be celibate and maintaining that laypeople should have sex only to reproduce. \"This doctrine of unrestricted procreation is strangely inconsistent on the lips of men who practice celibacy and preach continence.\"\n\nThomas also deplored the secular objection to birth control because it originated from \"racial and national\" group-think. \"The white race, we are told, our own nationwhatever that nation may beis endangered by practicing birth control. Birth control is something like disarmamenta good thing if effected by international agreement, but otherwise dangerous to us in both a military and economic sense. If we are not to be overwhelmed by the 'rising tide of color' we must breed against the world. If our nation is to survive, it must have more cannon and more babies as prospective food for the cannon.\"\n\nThomas was also very critical of  and of  in the postwar years (especially after the ) and often collaborated with the .\n\n\nAfter 1945, Thomas sought to make the  the leader of social reform, in collaboration with labor leaders like . In 1961, he released an album, ''The Minority Party in America: Featuring an Interview with Norman Thomas'', on , which focused on the role of the third party.\n\nThomas actively campaigned for  in the 1964 presidential election. He was critical of Johnson's foreign policy, but praised his work on civil rights and poverty. Thomas called Johnson's opponent  a \"personable man with good stands on domestic issues\" but also described him as \"the greatest evil\" due to his views on foreign policy.\n\nThomas's 80th birthday in 1964 was marked by a well-publicized gala at the  in Manhattan. At the event Thomas called for a cease-fire in Vietnam and read birthday telegrams from , , and  He also received a check for $17,500 () in donations from supporters. \"It won't last long,\" he said of the check, \"because every organization I'm connected with is going bankrupt.\"\n\nIn 1966, the conservative journalist and writer  chose Thomas to be the third guest on Buckley's new television interview show, ''''. In 1968, Thomas signed the \"\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the .\n\nAlso in 1966, Thomas traveled to the  along with future Congressman  to observe that country's . The two were leaders of the \"Committee on free elections in the Dominican Republic\", an organization based in the U.S. that monitored the election, in which  of the , affiliated with the , was beaten closely but decisively by the conservative ex-president . Balaguer continued to govern the country on and off for the next 30 years. In the autumn of that year, Thomas received the second  for his work in promoting world peace.\n\n\nIn 1910, Thomas married Frances Violet Stewart (1881–1947), the granddaughter of , financial adviser to Presidents  and , and a trustee of Princeton for many years. Together, they had three daughters and two sons:\n* Mary \"Polly\" Thomas (1914–2010), who married Herbert C.

Pursuant to his wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered on .\n\n\nThe  (formerly known as Central Commercial High School) in  and the Norman Thomas '05 Library at 's  are named after him, as is the assembly hall at the , where he was a frequent visitor.

In the , he was selected by independent candidate  as his  running mate on a ticket which had the endorsement of the .\n\nCamejo was a three-time  gubernatorial candidate in California, most recently in , when he received 2.3 percent of the vote. Camejo also ran in the  finishing  (2.8%), and in , finishing third with 5.3%. In the  he ran for the , receiving 90,310 votes.\n\n\nCamejo was a first-generation American of n descent. At the time of his birth, his mother was residing in the  borough of . Although Camejo spent most of his early childhood in Venezuela, he was a \"natural born citizen\" of the United States and therefore constitutionally eligible for the U.S. Presidency later in life.\n\nHis parents, Elvia Guanche and , divorced when their son was seven. Camejo then resided with his mother in the United States and returned to Venezuela during summer holidays to visit family. In later youth Camejo showed talent as a , competing in 1960 for Venezuela at the  with his father in the , where they took 21st place.\n\nCamejo entered the , involving himself in  and, increasingly,  politics. Later he studied history at the , where he won election to student council. His participation in a protest of the  in 1967 led to his suspension from the university for \"using an unauthorized microphone.\" Then-governor  deemed Camejo one of California's ten most dangerous citizens due to his presence at  protests.\"Peter Camejo, 68, Dies; '04 Nader Pick\" AP, September 13, 2008, 9:46 p.m. ET, in the ''New York Times''  He also participated in one of the .\n\n\nInitially, Camejo was a member of the  (SWP), a  party. As a branch organizer, he sought to reorient the SWP towards the student movement.\n\n\nCamejo's first political campaign on behalf of the SWP came in 1967 when as a 27-year old he ran for mayor . He was the SWP's nominee for  and won 90,986 votes, or 0.1%.\n\nWhile a member of the Socialist Workers Party, Camejo wrote ''Racism, Revolution, Reaction, 1861-1877. The Rise and Fall of Radical Reconstruction,'' published by the party's publishing house, . He also met with .\n\nThe SWP's policy was to turn its members into \"proletarians\" by having them take jobs in factories and advocate for a worker-based class struggle. By 1980, Camejo came to disagree with this policy in favor of , and the SWP expelled him. He led the third dissident group of the SWP and formed North Star Network in 1983.\n\nIn 1992 Camejo committed $20,000 of his own money toward establishing the Progressive Alliance of Alameda County, an organizational effort that did not sustain itself.\n\nCamejo was quoted in 2002 as claiming that he was a watermelongreen on the outside but red on the inside.\n\nHowever, in January 2004 Camejo initiated the  which compares , to avocados. ''\"An avocado is Green on the outside and Green on the inside.\"''\n\nJust over a month after the 2004 election, Camejo was elected as one of California's delegates to the National Committee of the Green Party and established the GDI, \"Greens for Democracy and Independence,\" a cadre group within the larger Green Party of  California that ran candidates for local Green County Councils. At the 2005 Green Party National Convention, Camejo stated that he would not be a candidate for President in 2008.\n\nCamejo wrote a number of articles concerning the divisions evident in the  in the aftermath of the turbulent 2004 national convention, continuing the themes of the  in opposing attempts to \"cozy up\" to the newly formed .\n\nIn August 2008 he attended the convention of the  in order to personally endorse Nader's presidential candidacy.\n\n\n\nCamejo ran for Governor of California three times, against incumbent governors  and  in 2002 and 2006, and in the 2003 recall election in which Schwarzenegger replaced Davis as governor.\n\n\nIn , Camejo ran uncontested in the California Green Party gubernatorial primary. In the general election, he ran as part of the first full slate of Green candidates for all seven of California's partisan constitutional offices. Camejo lost the election to Governor , but he polled 393,036 votes, for 5.3% of the vote, the largest vote total for a  in the California governor's race since , when Henry R. Schmidt of the  polled 7.1%. Because the San Francisco Green Party endorsed him, Camejo earned more votes in  than  gubernatorial nominee , a rarity in third-party politics. \n\n\nIn 2003, he was the endorsed  candidate for governor (although several other Greens appeared on the ballot) in an unprecedented  election against , in which he polled , coming in fourth in a field of 135 certified candidates. In a strange preview of the divisions about to erupt on the left in the following year, Camejo first cooperated with, and then competed with, fellow recall candidate .\n\n\n\t\nIn , Camejo made his third bid for Governor of California against incumbent  and Democratic Party nominee . Camejo received 193,553 votes, or 2.3% of the popular vote.\n\n criticized Camejo for \"lending his support to the right-wing effort to depose California governor \" by recall in 2004. However, the  state convention easily voted to endorse Camejo as a recall replacement candidate.\n\n\nCamejo was submitted as a candidate in the Green Party of California's March 2, 2004, Presidential Preference Primary. Before the primary, he made it known that he was not planning to run for president and that any delegates pledged to him would not be committed to vote for him after the first round. The former gubernatorial candidate received 33,753 votes (75.9%) of the Green Party membership's support in California, and 72.7% of the votes in all Green Party primary elections.\n\nIn June 2004, Camejo campaigned for the vice-presidential spot beside two-time Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader as independents (i.e. Nader never actually joined the Green Party), running against whoever the Green Party nominee might be. They received the endorsement of the , which gave them ballot access in several states they would not otherwise have. With votes for Nader added in, the Nader/Camejo ticket had what appeared to be an insurmountable 83% of Green voters behind their candidacies going into the Green Party National Convention in Milwaukee. However many delegates were alienated by non-Green Party member Ralph Nader's wanting the party's hard-won ballot lines, and by Camejo's maneuver serving as a proxy for Nader in California. After an extremely contentious proceeding the convention nominated Green Party members  and  for the Green Party ticket instead. Rejected by the Greens, Nader and Camejo continued their campaign as independent candidates.\n\nBoth Nader and Camejo asserted the main reason they ran in the 2004 election was because there were no other national candidates demanding an immediate withdrawal of American troops from what they believe is an immoral and unconstitutionally pursued  (though minor party national candidates Green ,  ,  candidate ,  candidate  and  candidate  all strongly opposed the war). More accurately the Nader/Camejo were the only candidates who had a regular voice in the mainstream media arguing for withdrawal, since Ralph Nader was regularly invited to appear on mainstream news, and none of the other candidates received mainstream media coverage.\n\nThe Nader/Camejo ticket came in a very distant third in the election, polling approximately 460,000 votes, or 0.4% of the vote. Camejo's supporters claimed this result vindicated the Nader/Camejo team seeking the Green Party's endorsement (of them as non-Green Party candidates) since Cobb/LaMarche received less than one third that many votes with a total of 119,859 votes (0.1%).  This was a drop of 95% compared to the Green Party's 2000 national ticket of Nader and his running mate .  Camejo supporter's claimed that the difference between these outcomes was made up by Nader/Camejo having four-to-one support compared to Cobb/LaMarche within the Green Party. Camejo's experiences on the 2004 campaign are chronicled in 's book, \"What Was Ralph Nader Thinking?\"\n\nThe Nader/Camejo Campaign cooperated loosely with an effort by the Green Party Cobb/LaMarche and Libertarian Party Badnarik/Campagna campaigns to do hand recounts across the country in states where vulnerable electronic voting machines had been used and anomalous results were questioned. Nader/Camejo undertook a challenge to the results in New Hampshire.\n\n\nCamejo is the author of ''The SRI Advantage: Why Socially Responsible Investing Has Outperformed Financially.''\n\nAt the time of his death, Camejo was engaged in writing ''North Star: A Memoir,'' published in May 2010 by .\n\n\nIn the run-up to the June 6, 2006, primary elections in California, Camejo helped create a cadre group within the larger Green Party of California, the Green IDEA (later known as IDEA PAC), a California  espousing \"Independence, Democracy, Empowerment, and Accountability,\" to support candidates for county councils, the locally elected leadership bodies of the Green Party of California. The IDEA PAC was not raising or spending money as of 2010.\n\n\nCamejo died of  on September 13, 2008, at his home in . He was survived by his wife, Morella Camejo; stepdaughter Alexandra Baquero, stepson Victor Baquero, and brothers Antonio and Daniel Camejo and Danny Ratner. He last worked as the Chief Executive Officer of Progressive Asset Management, a financial investment firm that encourages socially responsible projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* , 2004.\n* , 2002\n* \n*  Catalogue entry at Special Collections Dept., University Library, University of California, Davis\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Stewart began working overtime as a stocking clerk with Safeway to support himself through school.  During this period he was married to Freda Alexander, his first wife. They had one son.\n\nHe was  in October 1976 and married for the second time.  He left Safeway in 1978 and for a brief period worked as a licensed general contractor.

The show dealt with social issues affecting Los Angeles such as s, drugs, and , interviewing government officials from all levels of government and community leaders throughout California.

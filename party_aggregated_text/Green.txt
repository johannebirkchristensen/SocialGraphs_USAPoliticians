In 1993, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of Saint Paul against . He married , a  from St. Paul, in 1995; they divorced in 2018. He was the  nominee for  in the , earning 1.5% of the vote and restoring the party's minor-party status.\n\n\nOriginally from Chicago, Dawkins came to Minnesota in the late 1960s to attend the  in St. Paul. During law school, he moved to Philadelphia to work with homeless youth, but intended to return to Minnesota. In 1978, he established a neighborhood law practice in Saint Paul's  neighborhood and set a personal goal of gaining election to the Legislature within 10 years. Before joining the Legislature, Dawkins said it was important to him that he get to know the neighborhood and its residents' concerns, so he volunteered for a number of community organizations and the .\n\nFirst elected to the House in a November 1987 special election, Dawkins filled the District 65A seat vacated by former Speaker of the House  (DFL-St. Paul) upon Norton's appointment to the state Court of Appeals.\n\nAfter leaving the legislature in 2003, Dawkins led the department of Neighborhood Housing and Property Improvement for the city of Saint Paul for several years. In 2006, he began working as an attorney at the law firm of Mansfield, Tanick, and Cohen.\n\nIn June 2014 Dawkins announced that he would run for Minnesota Attorney General under the Green Party banner.\n\nIf Dawkins had won 5 percent of the vote, it would have elevated the  to the major-party status it once held in Minnesota.\n\n\nDawkins served on several House committees during his time in the Minnesota House, including those governing capital investment, family and civil law, energy and regulated industries, environment and natural resources, financial institutions and insurance, housing, jobs and economic development, and taxes.\n\nHe also sponsored youth works legislation to provide college tuition to students volunteering in communities, much like the AmeriCorps program; the Great Northern Corridor economic development project; and a homeownership program for urban and low-income residents. Dawkins also sponsored several measures in an effort to raise awareness of drug crimes and prostitution problems in Frogtown and to study racial bias in the state court system.\n\n\n\n\nAs a DFL State Legislator for 15 years, Dawkins saw firsthand how money dictated what got done in government:\n\nI had enough seniority as a democrat to be the tax chair in the Minnesota Legislature but I was told 'Dawkins you'll never be the tax chair 'cause you pissed off the real-estate industry, you pissed off the bankers, and you tried to do the tax stuff the right way for the little guys and they’re not going to let you be the tax chair'. I was told that I'm not going to be the tax chair unless I can get these big lobbyists to support me to be the tax chair.  Minnesota's no different than Washington; big money runs our country on every level these days.\n\nWho gets to run, who gets elected, what gets enacted, who gets served by what gets enacted is all ruled by big money these days. I would get the million dollars once in a while for a little housing program or start a youth program ... but when you're talking about the hundreds of millions of dollars that's at play all the time in politics; if the insurance companies don't like your bill then it ain't gonna move, if you don't write something in so that they come out o.k. the bankers and the finance industries and the lenders will put a stop to it, it's up and down the line.\n\n\nDawkins is strongly opposed to the  and Twin Metals Minnesota LLC proposed sulfide/copper-nickel mines in northern Minnesota. Because of the threat of  to the  and the short term nature of the jobs these mines will create, Dawkins had this to say:\n\nI don't think we need to do any sort of sulfide mining, period ... the whole thing is about profit for foreign investors, and to then argue there's a few jobs in the mining industry, well, compare that to the amount of jobs we'd get if we keep doing renewables and sustainables. Until we have that debate, I'm totally against.\n\n\nDawkins supported the  (ranked choice voting) ballot initiative early on in the city of . With his Minnesota Attorney General campaign, Dawkins is endorsing the idea of a statewide adoption of ranked choice voting.\n\n\nDawkins supports legalizing \"sensible\" use of recreational marijuana.\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She has been a noted advocate for  in the United States and internationally. She is the mother of actor .\n\nShe was featured prominently in the 1997 book ''Myth of the Welfare Queen'' by -winning journalist . In 2011, Honkala was the Green Party candidate for , running on the promise of refusing to  families from their homes. She was the  nominee for  in the .\n\n\nCheri Honkala was born in , Minnesota, in 1963. Her father, Maynard Duane Honkala, was of  ancestry, and her mother self-identified as having  ancestry. She grew up watching her mother suffer from . Honkala's mother quietly endured this abuse for fear of losing her children. Honkala was removed from the household and spent most of her youth incarcerated in a total of nine .\n\nWhen Honkala was 17, her 19-year-old brother Mark, who suffered from mental health issues, died by suicide. Because he was uninsured, he could not afford to get the professional help he needed. At the time of Mark's suicide, Honkala was already a mother (with a son, Mark, named after her brother), living out of her car and going to high school. Despite her difficult upbringing, she managed to graduate.\n\nAfter living in an apartment in Minnesota, Honkala and her young son were forced to move out and live out of their white . She and her son became homeless after the Camaro was demolished by a drunk driver. Honkala could not find a shelter that would allow them to remain together that winter. To stay together and keep from freezing, Honkala decided to move into an abandoned  (HUD) home. She would later comment, \"I chose to live, and I chose to keep my son alive.\" She called a press conference, in which she said, \"This is me, this is my nine-year-old son, and we're not leaving until somebody can tell us where we can live and not freeze to death.\"\n\n\nFor the past 25 years, Honkala has been a leading advocate for the poor and homeless in America. While still living in Minnesota, she formed the Twin Cities anti-poverty groups \"Women, Work and Welfare\" and \"Up and Out of Poverty Now.\" In , she co-founded the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU) and the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign (PPEHRC). She has organized numerous protests, holding marches, demonstrations and setting up , in the course of which activities she claims to have been arrested for  violations more than 200 times. She is known internationally for her work advocating for the rights of , and has received recognition in numerous publications for her role in bringing attention to issues such as homelessness and home s and has been called \"the protester's protester.\" Currently based in Philadelphia, she has devoted most of her attention to the rise in  among lower income families.\n\n\n\nAfter moving to Philadelphia with her son in the late 1980s, in 1991 Honkala co-founded KWRU, the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, named after the  area in northern Philadelphia, where Honkala lived. She called KWRU a \"Philadelphia based interracial organization of welfare recipients and other poor people.\" In the winter of 1993, when homeless shelters were full, the organization took over an abandoned Catholic Church to use as a shelter. In late 1994, KWRU broke into and took over vacant HUD homes destined for low-income housing and subsidized rent, although all the inhabitants (which included Honkala herself) were eligible for the housing program under the rules. They chose to ignore the bureaucracy and its delays, particularly the paperwork, paying rent into an escrow account to avoid trespassing charges. This became known as the Underground Railroad Project.\n\nFrom that time, the volunteers of the organization regularly (and illegally) took over HUD homes to provide accommodations for homeless families. To provide a support system to these families, the organization set up what they called an \"'Underground Railroad,' a network of other poor people, students, social workers, doctors and lawyers.\" Said Honkala: \"Stealing slaves out of captivity was against the law ... But it was right. Sometimes the law is wrong. Sometimes you have to appeal to a higher authority.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1994, the Quaker Lace factory (a manufacturer of lace tablecloths) in the Kensington area of Philadelphia burned down, leaving an empty lot. The following summer, Honkala and KWRU constructed a large tent city on the site. Because Philadelphia authorities could not produce documentation establishing who owned the property, it was unable to evict the residents. (Eventually, they were driven out by flooding.) This very public action resulted in a substantial increase in donations to KWRU.\n\nIn September 1995, while the tent city was still standing, Honkala staged a protest by camping out for 36 hours, with others from the tent city, on  within sight of the , to make the plight of Philadelphia's homeless visible to residents and tourists next to one of the city's most famous landmarks. Although she argued that she and the others were merely exercising their right to free speech and had not hurt the , she was cited and later tried for \"residing in a park area.\" She was sentenced to six months' probation and fined $250. In July 1997, she was involved with the Liberty Bell once more, when she led a group on the \"March for Our Lives\" from the Bell to the  building in New York to protest so-called welfare reform as a violation of the human rights of the poor. This action led directly to the formation of the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign (PPEHRC).\n\nIn October 1996, Honkala, with KWRU, staged a sit-in on the floor of the rotunda of Harrisburg's capitol building.  The organization created a makeshift \"city\" that it dubbed \"Ridgeville\" after Republican Governor , who had slashed social service benefits. Part of the purpose of the protests was to point out to the homeless the opulence of Gov. Ridge's lifestyle, including the governor's mansion, supported at state expense. The protest was supported by legislators opposed to the cuts, who bought meals for the protesters.\n\nIn April 1997, Honkala was arrested on a charge of \"defiant trespassing\" for attempting to build shacks for homeless families in Philadelphia on an empty industrial lot, though at the time, the shelter system was full and people were living on the streets.\n\nThe organization's leaders maintained that \"some U.S. laws, such as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, which limits the amount of time a family can receive federal assistance, violate Articles 23, 25 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those articles guarantee, respectively, the right to work for a living wage under humane conditions; the right to adequate food, housing, medical care and social security; and the right to education.\"\n\nStarting in June 1998, KWRU led the New Freedom Bus Tour, which traveled across the country, gathering stories of human rights violations to present as a petition to the United Nations. \"Under the banner 'Freedom from Unemployment, Hunger and Homelessness,' the KWRU team collected additional evidence on the [negative] impact of [welfare reform] and held educational sessions teaching the poor about their economic rights.\" (A second such bus tour was organized by the PPEHRC in November–December 2002, which traveled to 27 cities to record human rights violations.)\n\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, Honkala started another nonprofit, the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign, of which she became National Coordinator. The PPEHRC represents \"a network of over 40 poor people's organizations from across the U.S.\" One commentator has written that the campaign \"is the only [national] movement to come out of welfare reform that has been organized by poor people, and not their advocates.\"\n\nThis organization was formed in direct response to the  (PRWORA) of 1996 (also known as the Welfare Reform Act), signed into law by Democratic President , which she and her allies claim hurts recipients of welfare. The organization's mission statement reads, \"The Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign is committed to uniting the poor across color lines as the leadership base for a broad movement to abolish poverty. We work to accomplish this through advancing economic human rights as named in the universal declaration of human rights  such as the rights to food, housing, health, education, communication and a living wage job.\"\n\nPart of the purpose of the organization is to make homelessness and the homeless visible, in order to force politicians to act. Honkala claims that the latter prefer that the homeless remain invisible, so they won't have to address the problem. In a speech, Honkala said: \"That's what [the authorities] are saying [to you]: 'Go hide! Go be under a bridge, or ... hide under a bench, and we won't arrest you, we won't do anything to you, because you will be quiet!'\" As Honkala declared, \"When you have nothing, you still have your voice.\"\n\nIn October 1999, PPEHRC organized a month-long March of the Americas, from Washington, DC, to the United Nations in New York. Participants in the march included low-income families from the US, Canada and . The group \"marched 15 miles a day for 32 days, sleeping in tent cities, churches and community centers at night, and holding press conferences and protests in local communities.\"\n\nIn July 2000, a PPEHRC march for the opening day of the  in Philadelphia drew 10,000 homeless and poor people from around the country. (Of the several protest marches during that convention, this was the only one denied a permit by city authorities.)\n\nIn November 2000, at the historic  in Manhattan in New York City, the PPEHRC held a \"Poor People's World Summit to End Poverty,\" consisting of several hundred activists from some 30 countries, to share \"experiences and [work] to build an international movement for economic human rights drawing explicitly on international treaties.\"\n\nOn July 4, 2003, Philadelphia held a celebration for the opening of the , a new facility housing the Liberty Bell. Poor and homeless families from the city held a peaceful protest to demand their economic rights. \"As the demonstrators marched toward Constitution Center single-file, carrying their own mattresses and led by children, park rangers, federal guards, and city police formed lines to prevent the families from approaching. Singing 'We Shall Not Be Moved,' the demonstrators locked arms and refused to leave the sidewalk. Protest leaders Honkala and Galen Tyler had prepared a 'Declaration of Economic Human Rights' to present at the Center. As they moved toward the Center, police moved to stop them, threw them to the ground, handcuffed them, and placed them under arrest ... Honkala was charged with one first-degree felony and four other felony counts. Police officers claimed that Honkala had struck one of them in the chest. However, a video taken at the time clearly shows Honkala carrying a mattress and being struck by the officer ... all the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the District Attorney's office.\"\n\nIn August 2004, Honkala marched with the PPEHRC in New York City (without a permit) to protest  and the  (RNC) and to publicly call for greater attention by the government to the needs of the poor and homeless.\n\n\nIn early 2011, Honkala announced her run for Sheriff of Philadelphia on a \"No Evictions\" platform, with a campaign slogan of \"Keeping families in their homes and protecting the 'hood.\" When asked why she accepted the Green Party's invitation to run, Honkala said: \"I've been involved in too many fights in my life where I thought I was separate from the machine and the corporate money, only to find out later on that I was being used as a pawn for the Democratic Party ... [The Green Party] has a strict policy of no corporate money, which I liked.\"\n\nAs a , Honkala during the campaign rode a horse down Allegheny Avenue in Philadelphia while wearing a white hat resembling a , in imitation of the image of a  sheriff. During her campaign, Honkala addressed the  encampment at  in Manhattan to express solidarity with the group's anti-foreclosure aims and to ask for help in \"occupying Philadelphia\" on election day.\n\nShe finished in third place with over 10,000 votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 11, 2012, , then the  of the Green Party for  in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, announced that she had selected Honkala as her  . Said Stein: \"My running mate has been on the front lines fighting for the American poor, taking on the banks, taking on foreclosures, standing up for children most at risk.\"\n\nStein and Honkala were officially nominated by the Green Party at its  in  on Saturday, July 14.\n\n\nOn August 1, 2012, Honkala was arrested along with Stein and three others during a  at a Philadelphia bank to protest housing foreclosures by , on behalf of several city residents struggling to keep their homes. The event began as a PPEHRC protest involving Honkala which Stein, after the former became her running mate, decided to join. The organization demanded that the mortgage company halt foreclosure proceedings against two Philadelphia residents. Fannie Mae executive Zach Oppenheimer had previously promised in writing to meet with the two women at the center of the controversy to negotiate a solution, but no such meeting ever took place. The protestors entered the Fannie Mae building and vowed to stay until Mr. Oppenheimer kept his word. Two lower-level officials met with the group, but when no resolution was obtained, most of the protesters exited the building, leaving only the core group, including Honkala, to be subject to arrest. They were charged with \"defiant trespassing\" and released the following day.\n\nJohn Nichols, a commentator for '''' magazine, compared the position of the Green Party candidates on this issue to the anti-banking rhetoric of President  during the .\n\nShe visited the PPEHRC encampment in , nicknamed \"Romneyville,\" and strongly supported its plan to protest the  in that city, beginning on the convention's opening day in August.\n\nOn October 16, 2012, Honkala and Stein were arrested after they tried to enter the site of the second presidential debate at .\n\n\nStein and Honkala ran on a platform they call the , \"an emergency four-part program of specific solutions for moving America quickly out of crisis into the secure green future.\" The program's name is inspired by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal in the  era.\n\nThe four pillars of the Green New Deal, \"the central platform of the Stein/Honkala ticket\" are: \n# '''An Economic Bill Of Rights''' – a) a Full Employment Program that will create 25 million jobs by implementing a nationally funded, but locally controlled direct employment initiative, replacing unemployment offices with local employment offices; b) defense of worker's rights including the right to a living wage, to a safe workplace, to fair trade, and to organize a union at work without fear of firing or reprisal; c) the right to quality health care which will be achieved through a single-payer Medicare-for-All program; d) the right to a tuition-free, quality, federally funded, local controlled public education system from pre-school through college, and forgiveness of current student loan debt; e) the right to decent affordable housing, including an immediate halt to all foreclosures and evictions; f) the right to accessible and affordable utilities; g) the right to fair taxation that's distributed in proportion to ability to pay. \n# '''A Green Transition''' – a) investment in green business by providing grants and low-interest loans to grow green businesses and cooperatives; b) investment in green research by redirecting research funds from fossil fuels and other dead-end industries toward research in wind, solar and geothermal; c) the creation of green jobs by enacting the Full Employment Program which will directly provide 16 million jobs in sustainable energy and energy efficiency.\n# '''Real Financial Reform''' – a) relief of the debt overhang holding back the economy by reducing homeowner and student debt burdens; b) democratization of monetary policy to bring about public control of the money supply and credit creation; c) a policy of breaking up oversized banks that are \"too big to fail\"; d) termination of taxpayer-funded bailouts for banks, insurers, and other financial companies; e) the regulation of all financial derivatives; f) the restoration of the separation of depository commercial banks from speculative investment banks, as was the case under the ; g) a 90% tax on bonuses for bailed out bankers; and h) support for the formation of federal, state, and municipal public-owned banks that function as non-profit utilities.\n# '''A Functioning Democracy''' – a) the revocation of corporate personhood by amending our Constitution to make clear that corporations are not persons and money is not speech; b) the protect of our right to vote by supporting the proposed \"Right to Vote Amendment\"; c) the enactment of the Voter Bill of Rights; d) the commissioning of a thorough review of federal preemption law; e) the creation of a Corporation for Economic Democracy, f) the strengthening of media democracy by expanding federal support for locally owned broadcast media and local print media; g) the protection of our personal liberty and freedoms by, among other things, revoking the ; h) a dramatic scaling back of the .\n\n\nThe SteinHonkala campaign set two immediate goals: to get its candidates on the ballots of as many states as possible before election day (November 6) and to make itself eligible to participate in the televised presidential debates, to take place in October. According to the rules of the  (CPD), the nonprofit organization that sponsors and produces the presidential and vice-presidential debates, to qualify for a place in the debates the Green Party's presidential slate must a) appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to make it theoretically possible for its candidates to receive enough electoral votes to win the election, and b) receive an average of 15% support from respondents in five selected national polls. The CPD's selection criteria have often been criticized as prohibitively restrictive.\n\n\nHonkala planned a novel political protest called a \"fart-in\" to be staged at the , held in Philadelphia, \"to greet the rhetorical flatulence of Hillary Clinton with the real thing\". Just prior to the protest, Honkala hosted a \"massive bean supper\" for Sanders supporters in her home.\n\n\n\nOn January 31, 2017, Honkala announced she was running for the  in the March 21 special election to replace , who was the second state representative for the  to resign on federal fraud charges. She was considered to have more name recognition than her Republican and Democratic opponents.  Honkala ran as a write-in candidate against Republican Lucinda Little; there was no Democrat on the ballot in the heavily Democratic district.\n\nHonkala was endorsed by many progressives and organizations including , , environmental activist , progressive entertainers  and , former Director Emeritus of Philaposh (a labor organization) Jim Moran, former Philadelphia Health Commissioner Walter Tsou, the PEOPLE Committee of the AFSCME District Council 47, Philadelphia Neighborhood Networks, the Philadelphia chapter of Socialist Alternative, and other local clergy and leaders.\n\nIn March 2017, Honkala lost to Democratic write-in . However, this election went under investigation by the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office and the Pennsylvania Attorney General. Honkala, alongside the Green Party of Pennsylvania, Lucinda Little (the Republican candidate), and the State and City Republican parties filed a lawsuit in United States District Court against Emilio Vazquez, the Philadelphia Democratic Committee, Philadelphia City Commissioners, PA Secretary of State Cortes, and the State's Bureau of Commissions, Elections, and Legislation. The lawsuit alleges widespread election fraud and voter intimidation on the part of Vazquez and the Philadelphia Democratic Committee, and failure to properly supervise the elections for the other defendants.\n\nClaims in the federal lawsuit include electioneering inside the polling place, money exchange between Democratic poll workers and election officials, a ballot box being at Vazquez's \"victory\" party, tables set up outside by Democratic poll works made to look like voter sign-in tables, election workers asking people who they are voting for, Democratic ward leaders handling the voting machines, Vazquez meeting with election officials on election day inside of the polling place, and other claims.  Despite the investigation, Vazquez was officially sworn in as a member of the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives on April 5, 2017.\n\n\nHonkala has been a controversial figure throughout her career as a protester and organizer. Feather O. Houstoun, a former secretary of the  under    and , said \"She has not been working, rolling up her sleeves on issues like Community Legal Services does. She has never availed herself [of] that opportunity, while other groups have.\" John Kromer, a former director of the city's office of Housing and Community Development, faxed a five-page letter to KWRU, in which he claimed that the group was actually preventing its poor followers from obtaining housing through its tactic of breaking into vacant homes, rather than utilizing established organizations. He wrote: \"No good can come of an organization-building strategy, which is based on misleading poor people or preventing them from obtaining access to available assistance and support.\" Honkala admits that the group failed to rehabilitate any of the homes illegally taken, but asserts that the group was instrumental in helping 500 formerly homeless people find housing through existing programs. Honkala added: \"I get criticized on a regular basis for not being a team player. But I have no qualms about holding a protest tomorrow at anybody's offices if they are denying anybody the basic necessities of life. You're not supposed to do that in Philadelphia.\"\n\nShe has been criticized for her confrontational tactics in dealing with the authorities. Author David Zucchino described Honkala's behavior at the first Liberty Bell protest as follows:\n\nCheri loved to make people uncomfortable ... She wanted people to squirm and recoil when they saw poor people. She was convinced that America sought desperately to keep its poor out of sight so as not to be reminded of the social policies she believed exacerbated poverty. If the country was going to turn its back on the poor, she was not going to let anyone feel ambivalent about it. She would assault people with her high-pitched nasal voicein public demonstrations, in confrontations with elected officials, in media interviews, and in front of a ragged tent on Independence Mall.\n\nDuring the church takeover incident, William Parshall, the deputy city managing director, known as the Philadelphia \"housing czar,\" was asked whether Honkala's in-your-face tactics \"made his job difficult.\" Parshall replied that he was far more concerned with such pending problems as national and state welfare cuts. He added, \"The question is, what are we going to do about it? That's the question Cheri should be asking.\"\n\nZucchino in his book details many confrontations between Honkala and the authorities, but also instances in which she reached a mutually satisfactory compromise with them. For example, during the first Liberty Bell protest, she negotiated successfully with park authorities to leave the site without the necessity of admitting guilt or of enduring mass arrests.\n\n\n\n\nHonkala and her activities on behalf of the poor have been profiled many times in various media.\n\n\nHonkala was one of two women profiled in Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Zucchino's book, ''The Myth of the Welfare Queen'' (1999). According to one review, Honkala, as depicted in the book, \"helps create a tent city to protest welfare cuts, joins the occupation of an abandoned church and the takeover by protesters of empty houses owned by HUD. She tirelessly seeks publicity for her cause, battles with bureaucrats, and rallies and comforts fellow protesters.\"\n\nShe was the subject of Chapter 6, \"Using Economic Human Rights in the Movement to End Poverty: The Kensington Welfare Rights Union and the Poor People's Economic Human Right Campaign\" by Mary Bricker-Jenkins, Carrie Young and Honkala, in the book ''Challenges in Human Rights: A Social Work Perspective'', edited by Elizabeth Reichert (2007). She was also briefly profiled in Katherine Martin's book ''Women of Courage: Inspiring Stories from the Women who Lived Them'' (1999).\n\nSince the mid-1990s Honkala has been extensively documented by photographer Harvey Finkle. A YouTube video was created consisting of many of Finkle's photos of Honkala and of other poor people.  She also wrote the introduction to Finkle's book of photographs of the urban poor, ''Urban Nomads: A Poor People's Movement'' (1997). One of the last photos taken by the late photographer  (1923–2004) was a portrait of Honkala for the series Democracy 2004, which appeared in an October 2004 issue of '''' magazine.\n\nInterviews and articles on Honkala have appeared in numerous print and online publications, including '''', '''', '''', '''' magazine, '''', ''''  and ''''.\n\n\nHonkala has been repeatedly and prominently featured in the work of documentary filmmakers  and , the latter a co-director of the award-winning film ''''. Their work with Honkala has included ''Takeover'' (1990), a film, financed by Bruce Springsteen (during the making of which they first met Honkala), \"about homeless women that was planned as the first in a series on 'heroes of the new American depression;'\" ''Poverty Outlaw'' (1997), the story of a homeless woman \"who must break the law to survive\" and which tells the story of the birth and growth of the KWRU; ''Outriders'' (1999), about the New Freedom Bus Tour; and ''The Battle for Broad'' (2000), about KWRU's and PPEHRC's march during the Republican National Convention in 2000 in Philadelphia. (''Living Broke in Broke Times'' is a compilation film condensing ''Takeover'', ''Poverty Outlaw'' and ''Outriders''.)\n\nIn the 1990s, the , as part of its \"Life\" series, broadcast on  a short documentary on Honkala and the KWRU called ''The Philadelphia Story''. In the profile, Honkala talks about gated communities and her complex feelings about the state of the country.\n\nThe independent film, ''August in the Empire State'', directed by Keefe Murren and Gabriel Rhodes, profiles several persons during the 2004 Republican National Convention, including Honkala, who is depicted leading her PPEHRC march against the RNC. In the film, Honkala discusses her commitment to the principle of .\n\nIn February 2008, on its flagship public affairs program, ,  ran a video profile of Honkala entitled \"Homeless Hero,\" depicting a campaign by the Nashville Homeless Power Project, which had invited Honkala to that city to organize \"the first major homeless action in the history of Tennessee.\" The video shows the construction of an encampment to confront Nashville's mayor, during his budget address, with the issue of homelessness. (The mayor never appeared.)\n\nOn September 7, 2012, Honkala was a guest of  for the program , \"Challenging Power, Changing Politics\", along with her Green Party Presidential running mate, , and Vermont Senator .\n\n\nHonkala has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards:\n* '''' – list of the 100 Most Powerful Philadelphians \n* ''Philadelphia Weekly'' – \"Woman of the Year\" (1997) \n*  – Woman of the Year (2001) \n* Bread and Roses Human Rights Award \n* Pennsylvania Association of Social Workers' Public Citizen of the Year\n*  (The International Foundation for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders), a -based human rights organization, named her one of the \"12 most endangered\" activists in America\n* '''' magazine – Hellraiser of the Month (April 2005)\n\nIn addition, the organization Honkala co-founded, the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, was a 1999 co-winner (with Dr. Juan Garcés) of the prestigious , given by the .\n\nIn January 2004, Honkala was invited to speak at the annual  (WSF) in , India on the subject of the \"War against the Homeless.\" In 2006, Honkala again addressed the WSF, this time in , Venezuela, to discuss poverty and , information that many of her listeners do not often receive from mainstream U.S. media sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonkala in 1990 married a Philadelphia-based union official, Bob Brown, whom she had met at a convention the previous year. They divorced not long afterwards.\n\nHonkala is the mother of the actor and director  (born 1980).

He ran a \"no money in politics\" campaign on social media, featuring the hashtag ''#FeelTheChern''.\n\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Cherney met fellow environmental activist . He was a musician, and Bari put him to work accompanying some of the protests of Earth First!, which she was leading. She wanted to emphasize non-violence in the group's protests. In earlier years, it had been known for actions that risked injury to loggers.\n\nShe was divorced and for a time, the pair had a close relationship. Later they remained good friends and colleagues in their work to protect the redwood forests and organize timber workers.\n\n\nCherney was active in the Earth First! , where he worked with its founder . On May 24, 1990, he and Bari were traveling together in her car when a pipe bomb exploded beneath her seat. They were both injured, Bari severely. The case was investigated by the Oakland police and  (FBI), which arrested the two activists. Although the FBI did not finally charge them, it suggested from its investigation that they were carrying the bomb to be used in another bombing action, and it had gone off accidentally.  \n\nBari and Cherney subsequently filed a civil rights suit in 1991 against the FBI and Oakland Police Department for violations of the United States Constitution during their investigation of the incident. They said that law enforcement, in suggesting that they were carrying a bomb they had made, was trying to destroy their reputations and damage the environmental movement working to protect redwood forests in Northern California. \n\nJournalist Stephen Talbot produced a documentary ''Who Killed Judi Bari?'' (1991) for San Francisco San Francisco public television station KQED. In the course of making it, he interviewed Cherney, Bari and her friends and associates, and many others. In the documentary he explored their contention that the bombing was the work of corporate lumber interests or the FBI trying to suppress the environmental movement in the region. He also touched on suggestions that Michael Sweeney, Bari's ex-husband, or others were involved. Bari strongly denied that publicly. \n\nTalbot reported on these events again in a 2002 article in ''Salon'' magazine, when the trial in Oakland was underway. He said that in 1991, Bari had privately told him \"in confidence\" that she suspected her ex-husband Sweeney of the bombing of her car. He kept her confidentiality as a source at the time, but believed that her death had released him from that restriction. \n\nSweeney was a former member of , a radical group in the early 1970s in the Bay Area. Bari also told Talbot in 1991 that she had suspected Sweeney of a 1980 arson and bombing incident at the Santa Rosa Airport. Afterward area activists worked to prevent the airport from being converted into a larger commercial enterprise. Ed Gehrman also published material about these issues in 2002. \n\nIn 2012, Cherney told  radio that he does not consider himself an \",\" preferring the term \".\" \n\nThat same year, Cherney produced his own documentary film, directed by Mary Liz Thomson, '''' (2012). \n\nIn addition, Cherney and his attorney gained a court order to prevent the FBI from destroying evidence it was holding from what is called the Cloverdale bombing, which occurred in 1990 about a week prior to the bombing of Bari's car. Investigators had concluded that evidence from the partially detonated bomb suggested it was made by the same person as the Bari bomb. The FBI said they never analyzed DNA from the bomb. Cherney sought to have  and other forensic evidence assessed with current techniques that might help identify the bombmaker in these cases. Cherney said in a '''' interview that he believes the FBI was guilty not only of framing him and Bari but of a  of related evidence. Cherney has stated elsewhere that “I believe the bomber is findable.”\n\n\n\n\n*''I Had To Be Born This Century'' (Churn It Up, 1987, 2004)\n*''They Sure Don't Make Hippies Like They Used To'' (Churn It Up, 1989, 2004)\n*''Timber'' (Churn It Up, 1991, 2004) - with Judi Bari & George Shook\n*''Who Bombed Judi Bari?''

Twice, in 1894 and 1914, he led \"\", a group of unemployed men who marched to Washington, D.C., to present a \"Petition in Boots\" demanding that the  allocate funds to create jobs for the unemployed. Although the marches failed, Coxey's Army was an early attempt to arouse political interest in an issue that grew in importance until the  of 1935 encouraged the establishment of state unemployment insurance programs.\n\n\n\n\nJacob Sechler Coxey was born on April 16, 1854, in , the son of the former Mary Ann Sechler and Thomas Coxey. His father worked in a sawmill at the time Jacob was born, but the family pulled up stakes to move to industrially thriving , in 1860, with Jacob's father taking a job working in an iron mill.Benjamin F. Alexander, ''Coxey's Army: Popular Protest in the Gilded Age.'' Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015; p. 5.\n\nKnown as Jake, Coxey excelled in school, attending local  and at least one additional year in a  before leaving to take his first job at the age of 16 as a water boy in the mill where his father worked.Schwantes, Carlos A. Coxey's army: an American odyssey. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1985.\n\nCoxey spent eight years at the iron mill, advancing through the ranks from water boy to machine oiler, boiler tender, and finally to stationary engineer. Coxey left the mill in 1878 to establish a business partnership with an uncle in a  scrap-iron business. In this capacity, Coxey went on a scrap iron buying trip to the town of , located 325 miles to the west, in 1881.Alexander, ''Coxey's Army'', p. 8. Coxey liked the town so much that he decided to stay, cashing out of the scrap iron business and using the proceeds to purchase a large farm and establish a quarry producing  sand for the manufacture of glass and iron.\n\nCoxey was a passionate equestrian, who bred blooded horses and raced or sold them across the nation.Donald L. McMurry, ''Coxey's Army: A Study of the Industrial Army Movement of 1894.'' Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press, 1968; p. ??? Horse racing was among the most popular spectator sports in the United States and Coxey's horse-breeding enterprise was prosperous, but he fell into gambling on racing, which contributed to the end of his first marriage in 1888, after 14 years and four children.\n\nCoxey would remarry in 1891, siring two more children, including a son named \"Legal Tender\" in honor of his father's quirky monetary obsessions.\n\n\n\nCoxey was born to parents who supported the  and he entered politics under this banner. With the coming of the economic crisis of 1877, Coxey became a partisan of the , which ascribed the nations economic woes to faulty economic principles which led to a severe contraction of the money supply in the years after the . Prosperity could be restored, Greenbackers believed, by the issuance of sufficient quantities of paper money.\n\nWhen the  emerged at the start of the 1890s, it earned the support of Coxey and most other Greenbackers and he shifted his allegiance to that political organization.\n\nCoxey had experience as a laborer and an employer; he was also aware of the agricultural situation. He was a reformer who was willing to spend time and money to promote his plans for the betterment of the social order. Coxey was regarded by many contemporary observers as convincingly earnest. One reporter wrote, \"He seems to be profoundly impressed with the suffering of mankind and with a belief that there is a deep-laid plan of monopolist to crush the poor to the earth.\"\n\nHe was often branded as a crank for challenging the economic system that made him so prosperous.\n\n\n\nIn 1893 a severe  swept the United States – a crisis remembered as the . Unemployment skyrocketed,  paralyzed the local financial system, and credit dried up, while a protracted period of  put negative pressure on wages, prompting widespread s and strikes.\n\nNever one to be short of either self-confidence or political ambition, Coxey believed that he had a cure for the nation's economic woes and began espousing a plan of , specifically road improvement, to be financed through the issuance of $500&nbsp;million in paper money, backed by government bonds.Alexander, ''Coxey's Army'', p. 3. This expenditure would in one swoop improve infrastructure, put unemployed workers to work, and loosen the strangled credit situation, Coxey believed.\n\nTo accompany his novel and controversial economic program, organized around the slogan \"Good Roads\", Coxey and his close political associate  devised a novel political strategy designed to force the United States government into action. Rather than attempt to form a conventional political organization to capture decision-making offices, Coxey decided upon a course of what would later be known as   the assembly of a mass of unemployed workers who would boldly march on Washington, D.C., to demand immediate satisfaction of their needs by Congress. This plan began to take shape early in the spring of 1894, to the point that by March the managing editor of the '''' would assign young reporter  to cover the \"queer chap down there in Massillon\" who was \"getting up an army of the unemployed to march on Washington.\"\n\nMany members of Coxey's family were opposed to his involvement in . His father refused to talk to reporters and called his son \"stiff necked\", \"cranky\", and \"pig-headed\". One of Coxey's sisters called him an embarrassment.\n\nHe was a member of the  circa 1912.\n\n\n\nCoxey lived to be 97 years old.  When asked his secret to longevity, he told reporters an array of reasons from elixirs to not resisting temptation.\n\n\n1885: Ran as the nominee of the  for a seat in the Ohio State Senate but lost in his first attempt at public office.\n\n1894: Led , a march that started in Ohio, and passed through Pittsburgh in April.\nInterest in the march dwindled in mid May. Coxey was concerned with the lack of meaningful work, and thus demanded that the federal government provide such for the unemployed. Coxey, his wife, and his son, Legal Tender Coxey, rode in a carriage ahead of some 400 protesters towards Washington D.C. He was arrested for walking on the grass and his army peacefully dispersed.

His mother, Effie (Aafje Kooiman), was born in the Netherlands; his father, John Rensenbrink, was the eldest son of Dutch immigrants.\n\nRensenbrink and his brother Henry operated the dairy farm upon their father's death in 1943. Unable to attend high school, Rensenbrink took a correspondence course conducted by the American School in Chicago. He left the farm in 1946 to attend , an evangelical college in ; his mother and siblings moved to that city the following year. Rensenbrink studied history, English and philosophy at Calvin and was editor of the college newspaper during his junior and senior years. He graduated with a BA in 1950. He then enrolled at the  wher he focused primarily on political philosophy, and received a master's degree in political science in 1951. This was followed by a  to study at the  from 1951 to 1952. Thereafter, he studied at the , concentrating on political philosophy, American politics, and constitutional law, and completed his Ph.D. in political science from that university in 1956. His Ph.D. thesis was entitled \"Technology and Utopia: the Structure of Freedom\". \n\n\nRensenbrink began teaching at  in  in 1956. After a year at Coe teaching history and international relations, he taught political philosophy and American government at  in , for four years (1957–61).  As he prepared for his first class at Williams in the summer of 1957, Rensenbrink met Carla Washburne in her father's college bookstore in Williamstown. Carla was a rising Junior at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They married in June 1959, shortly after her graduation.\n\nThey moved to Maine in 1961. Rensenbrink taught political philosophy and history at  in , for one year before taking a job in 1962 for three years as education advisor to the governments of  and , sponsored by the . He and Carla and their daughters Kathryn and Margaret, (born in Dar es Salaam), aged three and one respectively, returned to Bowdoin College in 1965. Rensenbrink was promoted to the tenured position of associate professor in 1968 and to full professor in 1974. The Rensenbrinks' third child, Elizabeth, was born in January 1968.\n\nRensenbrink spent the first six months of 1983 in , accompanied by his wife and three daughters, as a research professor at the Marie Sklodowska University in , sponsored jointly by that university and Lock Haven State University in . This was during the suppression of the . Eluding the watchful eye of the Communist regime's secret police, he researched and studied the sources and shape of social change as represented by Solidarity. He wrote his first book, based on that experience, in 1988, published by the University of Louisiana Press, \"Poland Challenges a Divided World.\"  In it he accurately predicted the non-violent overthrow of the Communist regime and the victory of the Solidarity movement, events which surprised the world in 1989 and led rapidly thereafter to the demolition of the  and the  in Russia.\n\nFollowing semi-retirement in 1989, Rensenbrink continued teaching at Bowdoin for several years, creating an interdisciplinary seminar for majors in Black, Women's, and Environmental Studies. Starting in the 1990s, Rensenbrink participated in the  (ISUD), founded by Janusz Kuczynski, head of the philosophy department at the . He presented several papers at their world Congresses, held every two years, and served as its secretary and vice president before being elected president at the Helsinki Congress in 2005. Serving as president for two years, he organized the 7th Congress of ISUD at Hiroshima in Japan in 2007. His presidential address was on cross-cultural dialogue as a major factor in the search for peace.\n\nRensenbrink delivered one of three keynote addresses to the 11th Congress of ISUD in Warsaw on July 11, 2016. It was titled, \"Co-EvolutionBasis for Inter-Active Dialogue.\"\n\n\nRensenbrink's first foray into politics was a letter-to-the-editor at the age of 14 praising Minnesota's political leader . The letter appeared in the Minneapolis Star Journal. It was the first of many letters to the editor in that newspaper during the next several years. While in college Rensenbrink participated in a popular campaign to unseat the mayor of Grand Rapids. Shortly after, at the University of Michigan in 1951–52, he joined the , but found himself disgusted with the politics of .\n\nRensenbrink left the Republican Party and became a  after listening to the speeches of , the Democratic nominee for president in 1952 and 1956. In 1968, following the assassinations of  and , and following Chicago Democratic 's police crackdown of student protestors at the national Democratic nominating convention in Chicago, Rensenbrink formed with others the Reform Democrats of Maine (1968 to 1970). The attempt was to help end the Vietnam War and to reform the Democratic Party. In 1976 and 1978, Rensenbrink ran in the Democratic primary for the Lewiston/Auburn/Topsham Senate seat of the . The district was heavily Democratic so a victory in the primary all-but ensured victory in the general election. He came up short both times, losing by only 170 votes in 1978. During the early 1980s, Rensenbrink joined with others in campaigns to close Maine's only nuclear plant. The campaigns were battles lost, by close margins, but the struggle against nuclear power was won in terms of public opinion. The nuclear plant, \"Maine Yankee,\" closed down within several years of these campaigns.\n\n\n1984 was a decisive year for Rensenbrink. While in Poland the previous year, he had heard about the German elections where the  participated. They had won  in the German Parliament. That summer, on his way back to the United States, Rensenbrink stopped off in Munich and in Frankfurt to visit friends who had joined the German Green Party and were celebrating their unexpected parliamentary success. That fall, back in Maine and Bowdoin College, Alan Philbrook, a fellow anti-nuclear activist, called to say he had been at the first meeting of the Greens in Canada and, on his return to Maine, registered the Green Party of Maine. The two then called a meeting for January 14, 1984, to consider forming a Green Party organization in Maine. This was accomplished in Augusta on that datethe first of its kind, as they later discovered, in the United States.\n\nRensenbrink quickly made plans to seek early retirement (which was accomplished in 1989) and threw himself into Green Party organizing in Maine and in the United States. A meeting in  was followed by regular monthly meetings of what was first called the Committees of Correspondence, later changed to Green Committees of Correspondence, with a Clearing House in Kansas City headed by Dee Berry. Working with the Clearing House, the annual gathering of a Green Assembly, and the Inter-Regional Committee that had formed, Rensenbrink headed a three-year project to produce a Green Policy Program, generated from the over 300 grass roots groups that had sprung up in the early years. The Program was completed and approved in September 1990, at the annual meeting of the Green Assembly in Boulder, Colorado. Thereafter, Rensenbrink, with others, formed the Green Politics Network whose aim was the eventual creation of a national Green Party of associated state Green Parties. The result was the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP), which, from 1996 to 2001 grew to include all of the state Green parties and then morphed into the  in 2001. Rensenbrink has continued to be active in the USGP's National Committee and annual Conventions and Presidential campaigns and in its International Committee, which he had founded in 1997 as part of ASGP.\n\nRensenbrink was the Maine Green Party's candidate for U.S. Senator in  against Republican  and Democrat . and received 4% of the vote. The Maine Green Party changed its name to  (MGIP) in 1998. It has grown steadily. With more than 41,000 Maine residents enrolled in the party, it has the largest per capita membership of any Green Party in the United States. It fielded a candidate for governor in each four-year election cycle from  to , getting 10% of the vote in  and 2006. Rensenbrink worked as campaign manager for two gubernatorial campaigns:  in 1994 and  in  and worked as a major advisor in the others. MGIP has run 10 or more candidates for the state legislature in most elections, placing one in the state  in 2002 and 2004. It has become the second party after the Democrats in Maine's largest city, Portland, and, for several years, has had three of its members in the Portland City Council. It has also elected several members to the School Board.\n\n\n\nRensenbrink helped found Merrymeeting Community Action (MCA) in mid-coast Maine in 1966–1967. Together with Professor Paul Hazelton of Bowdoin College's Education Department, Rensenbrink developed and wrote for MCA the first successfully funded  in Maine and served on MCA's board of directors for several years.\n\nIn 1999, Rensenbrink, together with his wife Carla and several fellow townspeople, created Topsham's Future, a citizen action group dedicated to balancing the then very rapid economic development of Topsham with the preservation and vitality of community values and neighborhood integrity. One of its major accomplishments was creation of the  Nature Preserve through extended negotiations with retirement-community developer John Wasileski. Building on their success in the negotiation, Rensenbrink and Wasileski joined together to found the Cathance River Education Alliance a program in 2000. The program provides hands-on ecological education for thousands of students and teachers in area schools. In 2019, the road leading to the CERA office was renamed \"Rensenbrink Way.\"\n\nTogether with several other concerned and influential citizens of  in 2008, Rensenbrink helped defeat at the polls a proposal to replace Topsham's Town Meeting form of government with a council form of government. Following this they persuaded the town Select Board to create a Topsham Government Improvement Committee. This committee, chaired by Rensenbrink, produced a Report recommending improvements in Topsham's Town Meeting, some of which have been instituted with others pending.\n\nRensenbrink, as part of his goal to help develop an international community of strong ecological and politically alert activists from among Greens and Green-minded people, established the Green Horizon Foundation in 2002, and continued as its president. Among its projects, it publishes Green Horizon Magazine, which got its start in 2003. Rensenbrink was its chief editor together with co-editor Steve Welzer of the . The foundation also conducts a website and does book publishing.\n\n\nRensenbrink died on July 30, 2022.\n\n\n\n* Praxis Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Role of Scholar and Activist, presented September 2, 1994, by the 's Organized Section on Transformational Politics\n* Award presented in 2004 by the Maine Green Independent Party \"For 20 years of outstanding service to the Green movement in Maine and the Maine Green Independent Party.\" \n* Award presented in 2006 by the Cathance River Education Alliance \"In appreciation for co-founding CREA.\"\n* Portrait painted by Rob Shetterly – Arranged by the Maine Green Independent Party on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the party, May 2009.

She is a former candidate for  for  in the November 2018 election and the  in the  in . She supports making significant changes to  and to the current super-majority voting rule in the Sacramento legislature. In 2002 she garnered nearly a half million votes in her run for California state controller. At the last 2010 gubernatorial debate in California, which excluded all third party candidates, Wells was arrested upon attempting to enter the building to watch the debate. \"The San Jose Mercury News\", Wednesday October 13, 2010\n\n\nLaura Wells was born and raised in . She earned her BA from  in 1969, where she was a scholarship student, majored in foreign languages, and was elected to the . Wells earned a Masters of Education at , and later worked in finance, business analysis and computer programming.\n\nWells has resided in California for more than 30 years. She has one daughter, Natalia, born in Oakland, now a musician and graduate of the . Wells is engaged to Charles Goodwin, a former probation counselor in the juvenile division.\n\n\nWells has served in numerous county and state-level leadership positions in the Green Party of California since she registered with the Green Party in 1992. She was a founding member of the Green Party County Council in Alameda County (1992–94; 2002–04) and co-founder and managing editor of the national Green Party newspaper, ''Green Focus'' (2002–2004).\n  \nIn 2006, Wells served on the executive committee of the \"IRV for Oakland\" () campaign while running for state controller. IRV is a voting system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, rather than selecting only one candidate, a method which eliminates the so-called  in elections.  Wells helped garner support for IRV from U.S. Representative  of Oakland and other local representatives of most political parties in Oakland, including Greens, Libertarians, Peace and Freedom, Republicans, and Democrats.  In November 2006, IRV achieved 69% voter approval. On January 5, 2010, the Oakland City Council voted to adopt IRV for its mayoral and council elections.\n\nIn 2002 and 2006, Wells ran campaigns for , receiving 419,873 votes in 2002, the most ever for a Green Party candidate in a statewide partisan race in California. Greenparty.org In 2009, Wells appeared on the Fox News program \"Your World\" several times to discuss tax fairness in California.\n\nWells has also participated in ten international delegations to  and  to study innovations in participatory  and new s, and has broadly worked in a range of volunteer and professional capacities for community and labor organizations, including Pesticide Action Network (North America), Women's Economic Agenda Project, and  United Healthcare Workers (West). She co-founded Green Focus, a party newspaper.\n\n\n\nIn January 2010, Laura Wells announced her candidacy for governor of California in .Chang, Jack.  \"The Sacramento Bee\" Saturday January 16, 2010  Wells won the Green Party primary on June 8, 2010 with over 78% of the votes.\n\nWells' campaign emphasized the California budget and tax issues, particularly , passed during 's tenure as governor, which she says must be changed, in part because it primarily benefits  over individuals.  In a position paper on Proposition 13, Wells wrote:\n\nProp. 13, in 1978, was promoted to California voters as a way to reduce taxes and to stop fixed-income seniors and others from losing their homes due to escalating property taxes. Since then, the bulk of the \"tax relief\" goes places the voters never intended--giant corporations. Corporate properties are rarely re-assessed since corporations don't die and seldom sell.\n\nWells also favored lowering the margin needed to pass a budget and raise taxes in the state from two-thirds to a simple . She supported increasing funding for education, and the use of a 'split-roll tax' to keep cap residential property taxes while allowing higher property taxes for businesses.  In a January 2010 interview with ''The Sacramento Bee'' discussing her views on taxes and the budget in California, Wells stated:\n\nThe two parties, the Democrat and Republican parties, do not address the root causes of the problem,\" Wells said. \"That's off the table for them. ... To get what we want and to have the revenue that pays for it we need to have a budget that makes sense.\n\nWells has also addressed the difficulty that third parties have in running candidates for state elections:\n\n... she says [the difficulty for third parties] is a result of the \"locked-down\" system the Democrats and Republicans have put in place. As a case in point, she said she had to pay $6,000 for a 300-word ballot statement when she ran for state controller in 2006, a fee she said blocks minor-party candidates from running.\n\nWells supports a  solution for California, and if given the opportunity, says that she would gladly sign SB 840 (the Single Payer bill introduced by State Senator Sheila Kuehl) into law. Wells also supports the use of clean, , local energy, including publicly owned utilities,  (CCA) and localized (distributed) electricity generation, instead of nuclear power or .  Wells also opposes government  of large corporations and banks and proposes the creation of a State Bank for California which could partner with local banks and credit unions, and potentially improve their ability to lend.  Other Green Party candidates, such as the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney, also support a State Bank proposal.\n\nWells has been endorsed by San Francisco for Democracy and numerous elected officials, described at her campaign website.\n\n\nOn October 12, 2010, Laura Wells was given a ticket to watch the California gubernatorial debate at  by a friend of hers and used it to enter the building. Wells was initially allowed in, but upon being recognized as the Green Party gubernatorial candidate, she was approached by security and asked to surrender the ticket on the grounds that it was not issued to her, but to her friend.  When she refused to surrender the ticket, she was handcuffed and taken from the building and put into a police car, and arrested for \"trespassing at a private party\". She was later released.  Wells stated:\n\nRepublicans and Democrats will go to any lengths, even arresting candidates, to keep the truth from California voters.  There are solutions, but voters aren't being allowed to hear from independent candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n election, 2018\n}}\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #3333FF; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    |  ()\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 159,751\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 99.3\n|-\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #17aa5c; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    | Laura Wells ()\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 832\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0.5\n|-\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #E81B23; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    | Jeanne Marie Solnordal ()\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 178\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0.1\n|-\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #FED105; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    | James M.

In 1958, when  was elected to the , Swainson succeeded Hart as the  under Governor . When the long-serving and popular Williams announced he would not seek re-election in 1960, Swainson decided to enter the race. He did so despite being pressured by influential  members, including Williams, not to run in deference to three-term , . Swainson won the primary against the party favorite, largely due to strong support from labor unions.\n\nOn November 8, 1960, Swainson narrowly (1.28% margin) defeated  Paul D. Bagwell, a  professor, in the . As a result, the 35-year-old Swainson became the youngest governor of Michigan in the 20th century.The \"Boy Governor\", , elected at 24 in 1835, was younger.

Swainson held since 1957.\n\nHe appointed the first African American to sit on the Michigan Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1962, Swainson was defeated by Republican , the chairman of the , who had never before held elected office. The win was attributed in part to Romney's appeal to independent voters, as well as to the increasing influence of suburban Detroit voters, who, by 1962, were more likely to vote Republican than the heavily Democratic city. (It also marks the only time in US history that a governor born in Canada was replaced by one born in Mexico.)\n\n\nOn June 23, 1963, Swainson accompanied the Reverend ,  , and approximately 125,000 people on a \"Walk for Freedom\" march down Detroit's .

Benson facilitated voter registration by allowing online registration in advance with approved identification and in-person registration on Election Day. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she initiated the distribution of  well in advance of the election and spearheaded the state's inaugural campaign to enlist and train a new generation of . Benson mailed absentee voter applications to all 7.7 million Michigan registered voters for the August primary and November general election, citing the need for equal access and health protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effort was funded by $4.5 million in federal coronavirus relief funding from the . In June, she initiated a platform enabling registered voters to apply for an absentee ballot online, using their  and last four digits of their . Voters were also allowed to submit a scanned, signed copy of their absentee ballot application via email. Benson also played a role in developing an online ballot-tracking tool for absentee ballots.\n\nBenson's administration has worked on improving voter education for students in high schools and colleges statewide, a factor in Michigan achieving the highest youth  in the 2022 election, where 18 to 29-year-olds participated at a rate of 37%, surpassing the national average of 23%, according to Tufts University's Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. In August 2019, she initiated the Collegiate Student Advisory Task Force to address challenges that could hinder the voting capabilities of young citizens.

Benson credited the achievement to prioritized voter education, enhanced accessibility and a surge in absentee voting, with 3.1 million registered voters choosing to cast their ballots by mail.

Local elections in May also achieved a \"record-breaking turnout,\" with 25% of registered voters participating, of which 99% voted by mail or in a drop boxsignificantly surpassing the 10-year average turnout of 12% in local May elections.\n\nIn preparation for the , Benson, alongside other Democratic leaders, has collaborated on the Democracy Playbook, a set of over 40 recommendations by the NewDEAL Forum aimed at enhancing election systems nationwide, with a focus on election integrity, voting access, and civic engagement. In July 2023, she confirmed that federal prosecutors interviewed her for \"several hours\" in March as part of the ongoing criminal probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. While not divulging specific details, Benson highlighted the investigators' focus on the impact of misinformation on election workers' lives and threats. Benson is an advocate for stricter penalties against those who harass election workers and for increased funding to support elections. She aims both to explicitly prohibit and to enhance penalties for threatening election officials, ',' and pressuring them to violate the law. She has highlighted legislative goals that involve tightening rules on  signature gathering, holding accountable those who mislead voters, and securing more funds for municipalities to conduct elections.\n\n\nAs Trump voiced concerns about potential election fraud associated with absentee voting, his criticism particularly targeted Benson's mailing effort. He called Benson a \"rogue Secretary of State\" Bridge Michigan |url=https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-gop-lawmakers-claim-jocelyn-bensons-absentee-ballot-mailings-illegal |access-date=2023-10-16 |website=Bridge Michigan |language=en}} and initially threatened to withhold federal funds for coronavirus relief, but later retracted his threat. Court rulings affirmed Benson's legal authority to mail absentee ballot applications to all registered voters in Michigan in 2020, while the state auditor discredited Republican claims of fraudulent ballots from deceased voters, highlighting that the 2,775 problematic votes represented only 0.02% of the 11,725,897 votes cast in the eight reviewed elections, with 98.5% of these few votes being cast by electors who died within 40 days of the elections. On December 7, 2020, reportedly armed  demonstrators gathered outside her home, echoing Trump's election fraud claims. The demonstrators chanted and made threatening demands to overturn Michigan's election results, linking the incident to broader efforts by Trump and his legal team to challenge the election outcome. No arrests were made and police confirmed that there were no breaches of criminal law throughout the demonstration. Benson faced death threats for her role in overseeing the 2020 election. In January 2020, a 72-year-old man was arrested after evidence was found in his home related to violent threats he directed at Benson. In December 2022, she stated that threats from election deniers that started in 2020 had not ceased. In May 2023, she claimed in an interview that after the election, Trump suggested she be tried for treason and possibly executed, an accusation he denied. In October 2023, a 60-year-old man from Detroit was sentenced to 15 months of probation after threatening to kill Benson and Michigan Governor .\n\nBenson's efforts to modernize and expand access to elections have faced legal challenges, with GOP officials claiming the mailings are illegal and could result in fraudulent activities, although the decision was compliant with the Michigan constitution and upheld in court. Michigan GOP lawmakers, such as Benson's predecessor , criticized her for using COVID-19 relief funds to mail absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. Republicans argued that the move could compromise election security and lead to voter fraud. Despite disputes and claims of potential fraudulent activities, experts argued that the multiple verification requirements in place make a significant increase in fraud unlikely. In response to concern over applications reaching dead or relocated individuals, Benson has contended that the mass mailing aids in identifying and removing inactive or deceased voters, and emphasized the long-standing signature verification measures as safeguards against fraud.\n\nBenson has been named in multiple lawsuits. In October 2019, she was specifically named in a lawsuit filed by Priorities USA, a Democratic group, over the elimination of absentee votes due to disparities between a voter's signature and other filed documents with election officials. In November, the group targeted her in a lawsuit challenging the state's automatic registration law and alleging undue burdens on young voters' constitutional rights. In March 2021, Michigan’s Court of Claims ruled against Benson, saying that although the instructions' content did not breach election law, she had not followed the appropriate procedural measures while providing guidance to clerks on verifying signatures on absentee ballots. In September 2022, the Election Integrity Force and others sued Benson and Michigan’s governor, , in a bid to decertify the 2020 election. Controversies also arose during Benson's administration regarding the Michigan Bureau of Elections' guidance on signature matching for absentee ballots in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. The guidance, maintaining the presumption of a valid signature, faced legal scrutiny, and in March 2021, State Court of Claims Judge  ruled that such instructions should be issued as an administrative rule. The court found the process used to send the content to the clerks did not follow the state Administrative Procedures Act, prompting the Bureau to undergo the APA rulemaking process, which is now in effect.\n\nIn a September 2023 opinion piece for '''', Benson argues that secretaries of state, including herself, shouldn't unilaterally decide Trump's eligibility to serve as President under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and emphasized that the courts, particularly the , are the appropriate forums for such determinations. Benson subsequently released the list of candidates to be listed on Michigan's Presidential Primary 2024 ballot. The list included Donald Trump.\n\nIn November 2023, Trump's legal team sued to prevent Benson from excluding him in Michigan's . The lawsuit argues Benson lacks authority to disqualify him under the , seeking an injunction against barring him from the ballot. Despite Trump's request for confirmation, Benson's reported silence adds uncertainty. The dispute traces back to a Free Speech for People lawsuit, asserting Trump's Capitol riot involvement violates Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\n\n\nAiming to address the state's 2015 ranking as the lowest in the U.S. for ethics and transparency, Benson has advocated for ethics reforms and emphasized the need for transparency in the state's government in the wake of various scandals. She has aimed to enhance citizens' understanding of influence in , with financial disclosures as a starting point and the possibility of addressing  accounts.\n\nIn March 2021, Benson introduced a legislative agenda called \"From Worst to First\" to enhance , coinciding with . The proposed measures included expanding the  to cover the  and Legislature, requiring personal  from elected officials, demanding more frequent campaign disclosures, and tightening regulations to prevent secret and foreign money in Michigan elections. In 2023, she criticized inaction from legislators, describing the state's  and  laws as \"far, far behind\" other states.\n\n\nA long-distance runner, Benson averages two full s per year. She has completed twenty-three full marathons since 2005, including races in New York City, Honolulu, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Florence, Venice, Chicago and Philadelphia. She completed her 18th marathon representing Team Red White and Blue in Rome, Italy. She completed her second  in 2016, and became one of a handful of women in history to complete the Boston Marathon while more than eight months pregnant.\n\n\nBenson was among several high-profile Democratic officials viewed as potential contenders for the 2024 U.S. Senate race in Michigan to take the seat of retiring Senator . Benson announced that she would not enter the race in March 2023 and said she would instead be focused on protecting democracy and elections in Michigan in her role as Secretary of State. She is considering a run for the open Michigan Governor's seat in 2026.\n\n\n'''' named her one of Michigan's \"Most Influential Women\" in 2016 and in October 2015, she became one of the youngest women in the state's history to be inducted into the , second only to .

She is a member of the .\n\n\nKaren McDonald was born on July 11, 1970, in , Michigan, alongside her fraternal twin sister , to parents Bob and Kathy McDonald. Shortly after she was born, McDonald’s parents moved from the Lansing area to , Michigan, where she was raised. McDonald graduated from Portland High School and earned her B.A. in English and political science from  in 1992. She became a public school English teacher and was a member of her local  union.\n\nAfter graduating cum laude from  in 1998, McDonald joined the Oakland County Prosecutor’s Office as an assistant prosecuting attorney, where she prosecuted child sexual assault cases as well as general misdemeanors and felonies and maintained a 100 percent conviction rate. In 2004, McDonald joined the Oakland County-based firm Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer & Weiss P.C., where she specialized in civil and family law, and was named partner and shareholder in 2010.\n\nIn her career, McDonald has carved out significant legal expertise in matters relating to children. Notably, she has been a member of the Foster Care Review Board Program Advisory Committee, Department of Health & Human Services Human Trafficking Protocol Revision Committee, Child Death Review Committee, Oakland County Youth Suicide Prevention Task Force, National Counsel of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, the Michigan Judges Association, the Women’s Lawyer Association of Michigan, and the Oakland County Bar Association. In 2018, she was the recipient of the Oakland County Domestic Violence Prevention Award and the Joan E. Young Champion of Children Award.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, McDonald ran for an open seat on the Oakland County Circuit Court, winning the non-partisan judicial election with nearly 60% of the vote. Taking office in January 2013, McDonald presided for over six years as a family court judge, taking a docket focused on divorce and custody, child abuse and neglect, as well as juvenile delinquency cases. In 2015, McDonald presided over the first same-sex adoption in the history of the State of Michigan, stating that the case was a great honor. McDonald was unopposed in her 2018 re-election bid, and on November 6, 2018, she was elected for a second six-year term on the 6th Circuit Court, ranking as the top vote-earner of incumbent circuit court judges.\n\n\nIn April 2019, McDonald stepped down from her judgeship, announcing her intention to run for the Democratic nomination for Oakland County Prosecuting Attorney in the 2020 election.  McDonald campaigned on a progressive, reformist platform focused on limiting incarceration for non-violent crimes, and ensuring prosecutorial decisions are informed by racial justice considerations. McDonald’s campaign was endorsed by 87 individuals and organizations, including the , ,  ,  ,  ,  Prosecutor , and numerous local  elected officials, party leaders, organizations and associations. On August 4, 2020, McDonald defeated incumbent prosecutor Jessica Cooper, claiming the Democratic nomination for Oakland County Prosecuting Attorney and advancing to the general election. On November 3, 2020, McDonald was elected Oakland County Prosecutor, and was the top vote-getter among all county-wide candidates.\n\n\nKaren McDonald took office on January 1, 2021. On her first day in office, Karen announced several key priorities for her administration, including a robust focus on juvenile justice, restoring prosecutorial fairness/fair and just prosecution, and reducing mass incarceration/dedicating resources to targeting crime drivers.\n\nWithin her first 100 days in office, Prosecutor McDonald shared the status of several important initiatives she undertook upon taking office. Within this time, her administration issued resentencing memos for nearly two dozen juvenile lifers, rolled out prosecutorial discretion to Assistant Prosecutors, established the Trafficking Unit and the Hate Crimes Unit, re-engaged the Prosecutor’s Office as an active participant in over a dozen diversion programs and treatment courts, formed a team dedicated to establishing a Conviction Integrity Unit, and re-established critical relationships with community and law enforcement partners. \n\n\nImmediately after taking office, Prosecutor McDonald formed an internal team dedicated to establishing Oakland County’s first-ever Conviction Integrity Unit. After receiving the necessary funding from the Board of Commissioners, the CIU was officially launched in February 2022. The CIU is tasked with reviewing claims of wrongful convictions and making recommendations to remedy them where appropriate. \n\n\nMichigan consistently ranks in the top states for human trafficking. To combat this, Prosecutor McDonald transformed the Narcotics Unit into a Trafficking Unit, shifting the focus from the use and possession of drugs to the trafficking of drugs and people. The Trafficking Unit has had success in prosecuting and convicting cases. Notably, in September 2023, Richard Coleman was found guilty by an Oakland County jury on all eleven charges brought against him by the Prosecutor’s Office, including Human Trafficking. The investigation revealed that over 20 women were identified as having been abused and trafficked by Coleman. \n\n\nOn November 30, 2021, a school shooter at Oxford High School took the lives of Madisyn Baldwin, Justin Shilling, Tate Myre, and Hana St. Juliana, injured several others, and terrorized an entire community. Prosecutor McDonald led the prosecution against the shooter, along with his parents who were each charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter for the gross negligence that led to the horrific shooting. The shooter pled guilty to all 24 counts against him as charged on October 4, 2022  After a Miller hearing in fall 2023, the shooter was sentenced to Life Without Parole on December 8, 2023, by Judge Kwamé Rowe \n\nJennifer Crumbley was convicted on February 6, 2024  James Crumbley was convicted on March 14, 2024  Both James and Jennifer were sentenced on April 9, 2024, by Judge Cheryl Matthews and each received a term of 10-15 years imprisonment, above the guidelines \n\n\nFollowing the school shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the first school shooting since Oxford, along with increased gun violence throughout the community, Prosecutor McDonald formed the Commission to Address Gun Violence in September 2022.  Composed of over 25 stakeholders from various disciplines across the nation, the Commission was tasked with creating and publishing a comprehensive, evidence-based model that can be offered as a protocol to schools, employers, municipalities, and community members to reduce gun violence \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Bruce and his wife, Beth, have two children, Mark and Kevin. Beth Caswell currently serves as the Adams Township Clerk.\n\n\nCaswell came under fire from Michigan Public Radio  for a 2011 proposal to issue the Michigan state $80 clothing allowance for children that receive state welfare assistance  as an $80 gift card redeemable at secondhand clothing stores, such as  and , rather than just adding another $80 credit to the Bridge Card account that would be untraceable in how it was actually spent.  The Michigan Radio article and a subsequent article in the Michigan Messenger incorrectly stated that this proposal would affect the clothing allowance for foster children; however, the foster care clothing allowance is a different program  and was never a part of Caswell's proposal.  Under the current system, DHS issues each year, on average, an additional $80 to a child's parents' Bridge Card for the clothing allowance.  However, once deposited on the card, the state has no way to ensure that parents actually spend the clothing allowance money on clothing for their child. In making the proposal, Caswell said, \"I never had anything new...I got all the hand-me-downs. And my dad, he did a lot of shopping at the Salvation Army, and his comment was&nbsp; and quite frankly it's true&nbsp; once you're out of the store and you walk down the street, nobody knows where you bought your clothes.\"\n\nAfter contact from a constituent, he revised the plan to also include major retailers, but the gift cards will remain only redeemable for clothes and shoes. “My sole goal in this proposal is to make sure that children receive the clothing allowance that the state has provided for them and not have it used for anything else,” said Caswell.  “I believe this solution will go a long way to achieving that objective.  If anyone else has a better idea on how we can ensure the money goes for clothing alone, I very much welcome those suggestions and urge you to share your ideas with me.  I appreciate the input I have already received that has resulted in making the proposal better.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Following his indictment, Inman has been removed from all committees.\n\n\nInman was indicted on May 14, 2019 for seeking campaign donations from unions in exchange for  \"no\" votes on repealing Michigan's prevailing wage law. Inman allegedly texted at least two union representatives opposed to the repeal to ask for campaign contributions to oppose the law, and stated \"We never had this discussion.\" The unions made no donations to Inman, and Inman ultimately voted against the union and with the majority to repeal the labor rights law. Prosecutors also claim that one union representative recorded a phone call with the representative on the same subject. Charges include extortion by using his authority as an elected representative, soliciting a bribe by corruptly soliciting a campaign contribution and knowingly making a false statement to the FBI.

Inman was acquitted of a charge of lying to the FBI on December 10, 2019, with a mistrial being declared on charges of attempted extortion and soliciting a bribe after the jury was not able to reach a unanimous verdict. At a status hearing on the case in January 2020, federal prosecutors announced intentions to proceed with a re-trial, saying the government felt \"entitled\" to a retrial and that prosecutors had been contacted by a juror from the case, who alleged potential misconduct from other jurors on the case. Jonker questioned if a second trial was \"mandated\" and wondered if the charges could have a \"chilling effect\" on other politicians who have a constitutional right to raise money for their campaigns. Jonker is expected to make a decision if there will be a new trial by the summer of 2020\n\nDespite the acquittal, when Inman returned to the legislature, he was still prohibited from using his office or staff and was not allowed back on any of his committees or to  rejoin the Republican Caucus. Inman has stated he plans to ask Chatfield to give him back his access to his office and staff, stating the office belongs to the constituents of Grand Traverse County and that he has yet to be convicted of a crime.\n\n\nIn August 2019, the Board of State Canvassers certified language allowing a group to collect signatures to potentially trigger a  to remove Inman from office.

Recalling when he was assigned the committee seat, he said that he wanted to learn more about the armed services. \"I had never served, and I thought there was a big gap in terms of my background and, frankly, felt it was a way of providing service.\"\n\nHe was a strong advocate for cost controls regarding military procurements. He has also pushed for less secrecy in government, working to declassify many documents, particularly where  are concerned.\n\nHaving believed that in order to improve the military the United States needed to shut down unneeded installations and get rid of excess infrastructure, Levin helped lead passage of the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act, which closed some military bases.\n\nLevin supported the , ensuring that all nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons from , are secured and dismantled. Levin argued that Nunn-Lugar presented \"a chance to bury the new  and  of that region before they have a chance to take root.\" After members of the  and then-Senator  (-) threatened to redirect funds from the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Levin joined a bipartisan group of senators in opposition to the 20% reduction in funding.

That commitment makes it easier for us to work with the international community.\"\n\nDuring the 2009 MDA/AIAA Annual Missile Defense Conference, Levin spoke in favor of the U.S.-Russian cooperation on missile defense: , March 23, 2009 \"Leaders in both the U.S. and Russia have recently expressed interest in exploring missile defense cooperation. Did you ever believe that some of our missile defense engineers and experts might be working together with their Russian counterparts? It could happen and if it does, it could help address a major threat. The bottom line is simple: We have a new opportunity to seek a cooperative approach with Russia on missile defense, and we should seize it. The upside potential of such an effort is huge – a geopolitical game changer. The downside is minimal.\"\n\nAs Chair of the Armed Services Committee, Levin was instrumental in the enactment of the  and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 and the legislation ending \"\" policy for gays in the military in 2010. He played a vital role in the enactment of legislation addressing the problem of sexual assault in the military in 2013 and 2014.\n\nLevin led Senate investigations into the treatment of detainees at  and .

In 2008, Levin became concerned that the United States and the international community lacked a strategy for success in Afghanistan, and that  failed to supply troops and equipment needed in emergency situations.\n\nLevin was opposed to the 2009 Afghanistan troop surge (adding 30,000 U.S. combat troops), stressing the advancement of training and expanding the ; saying that the ANA should increase to 240,000 by 2012, from the original goal of 134,000, and the number of active members of the  should expand to 160,000, from the initial goal of 96,000. Though Levin advocated a \"surge of Afghan security forces,\" he said that he wouldn't rule out temporarily expanding the number of combat forces, but stuck with his original position. He questioned top  officials including   and   during a senate hearing on the Afghanistan surge, saying that, \"Where I have questions is whether the rapid deployment of a large number of U.S. combat forces, without an adequate number of Afghan security forces for our troops to partner with, serves that mission.\" Levin opposed setting a timetable for Afghanistan, voting against Senate Amendment 4204, requiring the President to submit a safe and orderly redeployment plan for combat troops and a plan to set a date for withdrawal, saying that, \"I don't think we know enough about how these events are gonna unfold, for there to be a deadline.\" Levin supported the U.S. keeping a \"limited footprint\" in troops and in bases in Afghanistan, and said at that time he would focus the remainder of his senate tenure on the \"rapid transfer of responsibility for Afghan security to the Afghans.\"\n\n\n\n]]\n\nLevin was an early opponent of using U.S. military force in , saying in August 2002 that \"if  had , he wouldn't use them,\" and that \"he's a survivalist, not a suicide bomber\". Levin proposed the failed Multilateral Use of Force Authorization Act, as an alternative to the , pushing President  to build an international coalition in conjunction with the , so that \"Saddam will be looking down the barrel of a gun, with the world at the other end rather than just the United States.\"\n\nLevin was one of 23 Senators who voted against the Iraq Resolution, saying that \"If we are going to take on Saddam at some point, it is critical that we have the world with us, that there be a U.N. resolve that authorizes war, because the consequences are very, very severe. If we go without a declaration from the U.N. it is far better to have one, and that means that we've got to bring the world along here.\" Levin has strongly argued that the  was a diversion from the . On '''' on November 14, 2005, Levin said that \"before the war, the President was saying that you cannot distinguish between Saddam Hussein and Iraq. As a matter of fact, he said that so often that he tried to connect Saddam Hussein with the attackers on us, on , so often, so frequently and so successfully, even though it was wrong, that the American people overwhelmingly thought, because of the President's misstatements that as a matter of fact, Saddam Hussein had participated in the attack on us on 9/11. That was a deception. That was clearly misinformation. It had a huge effect on the American people.\"\n\n  hit back at senior U.S. politicians who have called for al-Maliki to be removed from office. He singled out Levin and , saying the Democratic senators were acting as if Iraq was \"their property\" and that they should \"come to their senses\" and \"respect democracy\".\n\nAfter the , with the Democratic Party taking control of the Senate and Levin being reappointed Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he was seen to have gained an influential position to oppose the 's Iraq policy, initially proposing efforts for \"phased withdrawals\". Though on January 10, 2007, after Bush announced intentions to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq, Levin said that he would support the plan if it were tied to a broader strategy of reducing the overall amount of U.S. troops; receiving opposition from his own party. In late January 2007, amid what was seen as the fiercest political battle over the Iraq strategy during the Iraq War, Levin joined a bipartisan group of senators, including then  Chairman  (-),  (-), and  (-), to oppose any further escalation in Iraq; and in voting in March 2007, in favor of setting a withdrawal date for U.S. forces in Iraq. After continued criticism over the , in August 2007, Levin and senator  (-), visited military bases in  and , saying that the surge brought \"credible and positive results,\" though it failed to bring the political reconciliation needed and urged the  to hold a \"\" on the government of Prime Minister al-Maliki. In October 2011, Levin said that President  made the \"right decision\" in withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, and not continuing a U.S. military presence.\n\n \"\n| source = – '' Carl Levin, 2011''Knickerbocker, Brad, \"Guantánamo for US citizens?

They both are members of Northridge Church in Plymouth, Michigan, and call Canton, Michigan home.\n\n\nSenator Colbeck ran for office during the  wave of the 2010 elections. As a member of the Rattle With Us Tea Party in Plymouth, Michigan, he leveraged his retirement account to fund his campaign to become the first state senator elected directly into the Michigan Senate without ever having served in public office in three decades. During his first term in the Michigan Senate, he served on the Senate Leadership Team as the Assistant Caucus Chair. He also served as the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and State Police budgets. During his second term, his outspoken opposition to , tax increases, and  standards motivated the Republican Senate Majority Leader  to make him the only returning Republican Senator to be denied any chairmanships. He later had him removed from all committees after Colbeck attended a Right to Life Dinner in the Senate Majority Leader's district.\n\nIn 2011–2012, Colbeck led the effort to make Michigan the 24th  state in the United States. Characterized as \"arguably the most vocal conservative in the Michigan Senate\", he led the effort to oppose state-based  in Michigan and . He was successful regarding the state-based exchange effort but, despite a procedural move that temporarily blocked passage, he was ultimately unsuccessful in stopping Medicaid expansion, which is now referred to as the Healthy Michigan program. He was also responsible for the passage of legislation to expand school choice and he has been a vocal opponent of the Common Core Standards Initiative.\n\nHe is a co-founder and board member for the Michigan Armed Forces Hospitality Center known as the Freedom Center. He chronicled his time in the Michigan Senate in his book ''Wrestling Gators: An Outsider's Guide to Draining the Swamp'' as well as chronicled the 2020 election in ''The 2020 Coup: What happened? What we can do?'' McHenry Press |url=https://mchenrypress.com/catalog/ |access-date=April 30, 2022 |website=mchenrypress.com}}\n\n\nColbeck was a vocal critic of government-led healthcare expansion in the state of Michigan. His ''Forbes'' articles entitled \"Free Market Healthcare Revolution: Why and How\" and \"The Case for Medicaid Block Grants\" outline his views on healthcare.\n\n\nIn 2011, Senator Colbeck co-founded the MI Freedom Center (aka Michigan Armed Forces Hospitality Center) to serve military personnel, veterans and their families. As the chair of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs budget, he implemented performance-based budgets that helped improve Michigan veteran services from among the worst in the nation to second in the nation.\n\n\nIn 2015, during the middle of an intense debate over how to fix Michigan's roads, Senator Colbeck challenged his colleagues to a debate over whether or not it was necessary to increase taxes to fix the roads. Senator Curtis Hertel accepted the challenge, and the ensuing debate was moderated by Kyle Melinn of MIRS News Service.\n\n\nColbeck has publicly stated that it is his opinion that wireless technology represents the primary environmental issue of the present day. In December 2018, he hosted a forum in  to discuss the benefits and risks of wireless technology such as , cell phones and . During his tenure, he introduced legislation which he claimed would empower consumers with increased choice as to the source of their electricity.\n\n\nHe was widely criticized in 2018 for his remarks at a public forum featuring former member of the Muslim Brotherhood  and former Department of Homeland Security affiliated counter-terrorism expert . During the forum, he referenced a document entered as evidence in the federal trial U.S. vs Holy Land Foundation called the \"Explanatory Memorandum\". The \"Explanatory Memorandum\" contains the Muslim Brotherhood's outline for what they refer to as \"civilization jihad\" in America. It cites organizations such as the Muslim Students Association as means to that end.  The  is cited in the Explanatory Memorandum as an organization affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. Colbeck made a point of highlighting that Abdul El-Sayed, one of his Democratic Party opponents, was Vice President of the Muslim Students Association at the University of Michigan. Abdul El-Sayed responded to Colbeck's remarks, calling for the GOP Field to condemn  and , and to Colbeck, \"You may not hate Muslims, but Muslims definitely hate you.\"\n\nDuring a public forum where he discussed belief in not utilizing tax increases, the Senator referred to his $72,000 salary as 'fixed income' since it remained constant throughout his eight years of public service. Critics took issue with his assertion, with some viewing the statement as insensitive to people of lower income levels. \"I often use the term 'fixed' to describe variables that are constant,\" Colbeck claimed in a statement. \"For example, I regularly refer to 'fixed' and 'variable' costs in financial discussions. Plus, I like to fix things and we have many problems in state government that can benefit from this attitude.\"\n\nColbeck called for the repeal of the Michigan business tax as a freshman state senator, claiming this and other cuts could save the state of Michigan $5.7 billion annually. When it became a House bill and it was time to vote on the repeal, he voted \"no\", citing issues with the legislation increasing taxes on seniors and property.\n\n\n\nOn May 31, 2017, Colbeck filed to run for Michigan gubernatorial office to replace the then term-limited Republican incumbent governor , whose second and final gubernatorial term expired specifically on January 1, 2019. Colbeck was widely recognized as the most conservative candidate for governor in the 2018 gubernatorial race.\n\nColbeck ran on what he called \"principled solutions\", asserting that the \"solutions to the issues we face as a state are driven by guiding principles, not the whims of powerful special interests.\" His \"principled solutions\" are: job growth, excellence in education, no state income tax, budgets driven by priorities of the citizens of the state, better roads, quality and affordable healthcare, affordable auto insurance, defending one's rights and supporting those who secure rights.\n\nIn August 2018, Colbeck lost the Republican primary to then- . He received 13% of the Republican primary vote in a four-way primary race.\n\n\nIn November 2020, Colbeck was a certified poll challenger at the TCF Center in Detroit, Michigan. He later appeared at the 2020 Wayne County Board of Canvassers and Michigan State Board of Canvassers certification meetings sharing concerns over unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. An affidavit filed by Colbeck claims that the computers used by election officials were connected to the , which \"opens the door\" to possible vote manipulation. However, chief judge Timothy Kenny found that there was \"no evidence\" to support these claims.\n\nColbeck assisted  founder  in the production of a two-hour documentary, '''', that aired on conservative media outlets and social media February 5, 2021, asserting Chinese cyber hacking was largely responsible for Joe Biden winning the presidency in 2020. '''' described the production the same day as \"a falsehood-laden film about election fraud,\" reliant upon discredited testimony and baseless speculation. Colbeck appeared on '''' February 12, 2021, as a guest of Kenneth Copeland Ministries' Victory Channel, insisting that Lindell's documentary stuck to \"100% objective facts\" and not \"conjecture\" and that Colbeck's role in ''Absolute Proof'' earned him \"no fallout,\" and that \"people are hungry for this information.\" The \"fallout\" relates to negative consequences Lindell incurred since promoting 's 2020 election grievances and conspiracies propagated since November by lawyers associated with Trump.\n\nIn June 2021, Colbeck participated in a rally at , calling for an audit of  similar to the . In the rally, Colbeck called the event a \"\" and compared the  to the persecution of  and in 2022 chronicled the 2020 election in ''The 2020 Coup: What happened.

The city was suffering a $30 million budget deficit. The city also had overall accumulated $332 million in deficit, more than $15 million in long-term liabilities. The city government's fiscal troubles persisted under Bing, with Detroit suffering increased budget deficits during much of his tenure. However, by the time he left office, the city's deficit had decreased by $7 million from where it stood when he assumed office.\n\nIn 2011, Bing proposed that the city's next budget include a $4 million decrease in funding for  staff, and fund new hires for the city's fire department. In mid-2011, Bing ed the budget passed by the City Council, claiming its cuts were excessive and could be to the detriment of the services of the city's police and fire departments. The City Council's budget made $50 million more in cuts than Bing's initial proposed budget had made. Bing's budget proposal was for $3.1 billion in spending. The City Council overrode this veto in an 8–1 vote. The city's 2012 budget made a 20% decrease to the city's fire department. This has been seen as having a detrimental effect on the city's ability to handle fires, including . In mid-2012, the fire department announced 164 layoffs. In 2013, Bing proposed a $1 billion budget, a $300 million decrease from the previous year's budget.\n\nBy the time he was reelected to a full term, Bing had dismissed more than 400 city employees and had ended 16 out of 51 contracts that the city had with s. Bing faced protests by unions during his mayoralty. By the end of his mayoralty, Bing had eliminated 1,000 positions in the city government, a 9% decrease to the municipal workforce. Additionally, many city employees faced decreased , decreased , and even s. Bing also d many roles of the city government. The city's public health department was replaced by the Institution for Population Health . The workforce-development department was replaced by Detroit Employment Solutions, a . Management of payroll and benefits for city employees was also outsourced.\n\nThe city enjoyed new private development over the course of Bing's tenure. This included both the opening of new es, an investment of $198 million by  in its Mack Avenue Engine Plant (which created 250 new jobs), and significant development in the city's downtown by businessman .\n\n\n]]\n\nBing proposed the idea of demolishing neighborhoods and decreasing city services. Bing spoke of his intention to depopulate neighborhoods, including through forcible means such as . This was controversial among city residents. Bing sought to incentivize residents to relocate from largely depopulated neighborhoods so that those neighborhoods could be demolished and the public services could be consolidated to more densely populated areas of the city. Past mayors had made pledges to demolish abandoned homes but taken little action to do so. Under Bing, the city took action to demolish abandoned homes, reporting in early 2013 to have demolished 6,700 since Bing took office. However, the city still had tens of thousands more abandoned homes. Bing's program of demolishing abandoned homes was controversial with some city residents. Aiming to repopulate certain neighborhoods, in early 2011 Bing began a program to give $150,000 in grants to assist in renovations of foreclosed homes in select neighborhoods. Hoping to encourage members of the city's police force to reside within city limits, Bing only required police officers to place a mere $1,000 in order to acquire abandoned residences and be eligible for renovation grants.\n\nBing launched the Detroit Works Project (later renamed Detroit Future City), an effort to create a 50-year outline for the city's future. The project was intended to create a community-planned vision for how the city would manage its problems. The city government underestimated how many citizens would attend community meetings. Controversy arose during the process, when Bing publicized his intention to depopulate certain neighborhoods by forcibly relocating residents to denser neighborhoods. The public anger at this threatened the project.\n\nBing sought to fix the city's broken s, which were considered a serious problem. In 2012, Bing persuaded the state legislature and governor to create the Public Lighting Authority of Detroit and dedicate utility and income tax revenue for the $185 million in bonds for this purpose. Bing appointed a lighting authority board, which then signed a contract with  to repair the city's streetlights. However, the contract did not take place until early 2013, by which time Bing had left office. Bing's successor  built upon Bing's efforts to repair the city's streetlights to significant success. It has been noted that, due to Bing being out of office when the work was carried out, he has not received much public credit for it.\n\n\nDuring Bing's tenure, there was trouble within the . This included instability in leadership, with the city cycling through four different police chiefs during Bing's less-than-5-years in office. While he gave no explicit reason for the firing, it was speculated that Bing dismissed the first police chief of his mayoralty, , both due to the  that resulted in the  and due to Bing's dissatisfaction with Warren's pursuit of media exposure through participation in  shows such as ''''. Even as crime in large cities was declining overall in the United States, Detroit saw its  rate rise to a 20-year high in 2012.\n\n\n (far left) and Secretary of the Navy  (center left) at the 2011 naming ceremony for ]]\n\nEarly into his mayoralty, Bing began pursuing a renovation of , the city's main . Renovation occurred while Bing was mayor, taking place under the management of a new cooperative governing authority for the convention center.\n\nBing established the city's Active and Safe Campaign  to raise funds for public safety initiatives, as well as raise funds for recreational programs and enhancements to the city's recreation facilities.\n\nBing made an unpopular proposal to decrease city bus service on Sundays. This never came into fruition.\n\n\nOn March 1, 2013, Governor  announced that he would appoint an emergency manager for the city of Detroit due to the city's fiscal troubles, making Detroit the United States largest city's to be placed under emergency management. Bing had, in the years prior, warned that this was a possibility, and expressed his desire for the city to avert such a situation. The placement of the city under emergency management deprived Bing of much of his mayoral authority. Bing declared that while he opposed emergency management, he was willing to work collaboratively with the emergency manager that would be appointed.  was soon after appointed to the emergency manager role. Many in the city criticized Bing for not being more resistant to emergency management.\n\nIn July 2013, before Bing left office, Detroit became the largest city in United States history to declare municipal . This was the decision of emergency manager Kevin Orr. Many criticized Bing for not doing more to fight this move by Orr.\n\n\nIn addition to losing authority to the emergency manager, Bing suffered numerous health problems, and had seen approval ratings as low as 14%. Bing announced on May 14, 2013, he would not run for reelection to another term in .\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n*  \n* \n* \n* \n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He attended, but did not graduate from , where he studied . He is also a licensed , licensed  and licensed heating contractor.\n\nHe is married to Jan Gosselin and has three children.\n\n\n\nGosselin was elected to the   in 1993. He served until 1997.\n\nIn 1998, he was elected to the  to represent the then- which included portions of  and Troy. He was re-elected to the same seat in 2000. In 2002, after his district was consolidated into Troy and , he ran for and lost a  seat against incumbent Shirley Johnson in the 13th District. In 2004, Gosselin again sat in the Michigan House, this time representing the new .\n\nIn 2006, Gosselin became a candidate for County Commissioner in the 13th District which includes the southern portion of  Rochester Hills and a northern  portion of Troy with a portion of . He unseated a moderate Republican incumbent, , in the primary. He handily won his general election bid for that seat. According to the Oakland Press:  \nHowever, with Gosselin term-limited out-of-office, the younger Knollenberg became the Republican nominee for State House in 2006, defeating Mike Bosnic in the August 2006 primary. Bosnic, who also ran in 2004 in a three-way race against Gosselin, was endorsed by Gosselin in 2006. Despite Gosselin's endorsement, Knollenberg won by 7%, or roughly 700 votes, over Bosnic.\n\n\n\nGosselin has achieved a reputation of being a conservative who appeals to the  as well as a strong  bloc of Oakland County politics. As such, he has gained the reputation of challenging establishment mainstream, , and liberal Republicans. This was the case in his 2002 bid for the State Senate as well as his 2004 House election.\n\nGosselin has traditionally supported a strong relationship between State Government and . He has sponsored various legislation to place the words \"In God We Trust\" and the  at the  in . In support of this legislation, which failed, but ultimately won by putting them in the Lansing Capital thru House Resolutions HCR 0056 of 2002 and HR 0024 of 2005. Gosselin traveled the state with fellow Republican Representative  with the 2.6-ton granite tablets involved in the . Gosselin holds the controversial belief that the  does not deliberately dictate a  and instead is a mere protection of all religious beliefs.\n\nConsistent with his conservative philosophy, Gosselin also strongly opposes . In the legislature he supported bills that would make it illegal to coerce a woman into having a legal abortion, requiring ultrasounds to be shown prior to abortions, to prohibit physicians and health facilities from accepting prepayment for abortions, and to establish a \"Choose Life Fund,\" funded with revenue from the sale of a \"Choose Life\" specialty license plate.\n\nDespite his interest in government regulation of abortion and association of government with religion, Gosselin has maintained significant support for and from libertarians. For instance, he endorsed libertarian  for City Council in Troy. This is because of his strong opposition to state and local regulations, taxation and benefits. While in the legislature, he voted against every single budget citing overspending in State Government. He was the author of a package of legislation known as \"Michigan Citizens First,\" which cut welfare benefits from illegal immigrants. He consistently favored substantial cuts to government welfare programs.\n\nHowever, with Gosselin term-limited out-of-office, the younger Knollenberg became the Republican nominee for State House in 2006, defeating Mike Bosnic in the August 2006 primary. Bosnic, who also ran in 2004 in a three-way race against Gosselin, was endorsed by Gosselin in 2006. Despite Gosselin's endorsement, Knollenberg won by 7%, or roughly 700 votes, over Bosnic.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Gosselin initially ran for the Michigan Senate against fellow State Representative . Many state political observers were anticipating a lively free-for-all between these two. This prediction was based upon the open animus between former Senator Shirley Johnson and Gosselin. Gosselin accused Johnson, who is a moderate Republican, of accepting donations from a pro-Gay group. He also attacked her position on abortion. Johnson actively worked for Marty Knollenberg's 2004 campaign against Gosselin. A joke between many observers was that if Gosselin were to win the Republican nomination, Johnson would endorse the Democrat, and one Republican insider seriously acknowledged this possibility.\n\nWhen  , son of Congressman  and nephew of  , entered the race, however, Republican leadership became concerned. Former Michigan Senator and fellow Troy State Representative  was coaxed by the  to run for the 13th District seat, as they believed he was the only one with the name recognition and fundraising ability to retain the seat in the general election. When Pappageorge entered the race, Gosselin dropped out.\n\nPappageorge defeated Taub in the primary in August 2006 by a two-to-one margin. He narrowly defeated Andy Levin in one of the closest and most controversial state senate races in November, by a margin less than that of the vote totals accumulated by the Green Party candidate.\n\n\n\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! align=left valign=top | 1998 Candidate\n! align=right | Party\n! align=right | Popular votes\n! align=right | Vote percentage\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Bob Gosselin\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|20,285\n| valign=\"top\"|68%\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Jacquelyn Moore\n| valign=\"top\"|Democrat\n| valign=\"top\"|9,712\n| valign=\"top\"|32%\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! align=left valign=top | 2000 Candidate\n! align=right | Party\n! align=right | Popular votes\n! align=right | Vote percentage\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Bob Gosselin\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|27,104\n| valign=\"top\"|67%\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Jerry Bixby\n| valign=\"top\"|Democrat\n| valign=\"top\"|13,279\n| valign=\"top\"|32%\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n\n\n\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! align=left valign=top | 2002 Candidate\n! align=right | Party\n! align=right | Popular votes\n! align=right | Vote percentage\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Shirley Johnson\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|13,412\n| valign=\"top\"|55%\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Bob Gosselin\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|11,141\n| valign=\"top\"|45%\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n\n\n\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! align=left valign=top | 2004 Candidate\n! align=right | Party\n! align=right | Popular votes\n! align=right | Vote percentage\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Bob Gosselin\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|3,754\n| valign=\"top\"|38%\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|Marty Knollenberg\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|2,851\n| valign=\"top\"|29%\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|2,734\n| valign=\"top\"|28%\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n|-\n| align=left valign=top|\n| valign=\"top\"|Republican\n| valign=\"top\"|464\n| valign=\"top\"|5%\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* .

She was formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for  at the  convention in August 2010. They campaigned around the state promoting a \"Main Street Agenda\" with emphasis on their shared backgrounds as mayors.\n\nAs with the national election results, the 2010 general election in Michigan saw strong turnout and enthusiasm by Republican voters. Political pundits attributed the losses by Democrats, in part, to voter reaction to President Obama and term-limited Democratic Governor . The Democratic gubernatorial ticket lost to Republican nominees , a businessman, and , a State Representative, 58%-40%. No statewide Democratic candidates were successful in 2010.\n\n\n\nIn late 2011, Lawrence announced she would be running in the newly redrawn . The district had previously been the 13th, represented by freshman Democrat . It was redrawn to take in a large slice of Oakland County, including Southfield. Clarke's home in Detroit was drawn into the neighboring 13th district, but he opted to follow most of his constituents into the 14th.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district, Lawrence faced incumbent representatives Clarke and , both of whom lived outside the district, and former State Representative Mary D. Waters. Peters won with 47%, to Clarke's 35%, Lawrence's 13%, and Waters's 3%.

She took the most votes in Oakland County, carrying Southfield, Pontiac and Oak Park, as well as Royal Oak Township. Although it was expected that Clarke would convincingly win the portion of Detroit within the district, where he lives and had previously held public office, Lawrence was competitive in the city and won more votes than all other candidates from voters who cast their ballot on Election Day in Detroit.\n\nAs the Democratic nominee for Congress, she faced Republican nominee Christina Conyers of Detroit in the November general election. But Conyers withdrew from the race and Christina Barr of Pontiac was chosen as the Republican nominee. The district has a history of voting heavily for Democratic candidates.

Lawrence won with 78% of the vote, Barr took 20%, Schwartz 1% and Boyle 1%.\n\n\n\n\n*\n**\n*\n**\n**\n**\n\n\n*\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* Congressional Former Mayors' Caucus\n*\n\n\nDuring the 2022 redistricting cycle, Lawrence's 14th district was eliminated as Detroit's congressional districts were radically reshuffled.

A member of the , Schor was previously a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners. He also represented the  in the , which includes most of the City of Lansing and all of Lansing Township. Schor is the first Jewish mayor of Lansing.\n\n\nSchor grew up in  New York with his mother and father. His father found employment as a diamond distributor while his mother found work in a nursing home. Schor moved to  to attend the , where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and History. During his time at the University of Michigan, Schor took a semester off to be involved with the  campaign his senior year as a paid staffer.\n\nSchor served as a board member of the Tri-County Office of Aging and the South Lansing Community Development Association.\n\n\n\n\nSchor was elected to the Ingham County  in 2002 and re-elected four times, serving through 2012.\n\nSchor was among the members of the Board to create the Ingham County Land Bank in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, as a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, Schor said that people who move out of cities to townships won’t know what they are giving up until they move. “Once they make that move, they notice what they're missing,” Schor said, referring to amenities provided by city governments like sidewalks, parks, and public safety (i.e police and fire departments). He also blamed state governments for deteriorating city services due to declining revenue sharing cuts.\n\nSchor was also critical of a 2003 Michigan Supreme Court ruling that gave school superintendents control over school construction, stripping the right from local communities to make decisions, saying “These are community, local decisions, and the only people who don't have to abide by them are the schools”. He also added that this ruling had been “frustrating for local governments everywhere”.\n\nIn 2007, Schor supported a cost increase for Ingham County Sheriffs to patrol townships stating he believed that out-county communities should pay an additional fee for road patrol services that are provided. He echoed these remarks again in 2010 by saying that since road patrol is a service only received by out-county areas, Lansing residents shouldn’t pay for it.\n\nSchor was supportive of a 2008 bill that would provide urban development areas with a 20% tax credit saying “From our perspective, anything that creates an incentive for more revitalization and redevelopment in urban areas ... is important”.\n\n\nSchor has also worked as assistant director of state affairs for the , as aide for then-State Senator  and in the administration of former Governor .  During his bid for Mayor of Lansing in 2017, Schor reflected on this time by stating he learned a lot of what he knows about running a city from his time at the Michigan Municipal League. Schor remarks that this is where he demonstrated his understanding of cities economic development needs and he successfully advocated for several laws creating municipal economic development tools.\n\n\nIn the , Schor served as Minority Vice-Chair of the House Committee on Commerce and Trade, and as a member of the House Education, House Health Policy, House Michigan Competitiveness, House Elections and Ethics, and House Regulatory Reform committees. Schor regards that his proudest moment in the State House was the 2013 passage of the Healthy Michigan initiative, which was the state's version of Medicaid expansion under . He talks about it as “the most important vote I made in my career,\" an initiative that led to more than 600,000 people signing on to the plan. Schor and state Rep. Kate Segal negotiated on behalf of the Democrats with the governor and Republicans in the House and Senate to see it passed.\n\nOn August 7, 2012, Schor won the Democratic Primary for State Representative 68th District with 3,142 votes, which was 43.19% of the vote total. On November 6, 2012, Schor won the general election against Republican candidate, Timothy Moede, who was a retired Lansing Fire Department battalion chief.

Schor received 19,602 votes (76.91% of the vote total), to Secaur’s 5,884 votes (23.09% of the vote total).\n\nIn 2016, Schor chose to run for his third term as State Representative for the 68th District. This would be his last available two-year term in the State House per Article IV § 54 of the State Constitution, that limits the amount a state representative can be elected to no more than three times. On August 2, 2016, Schor won the Democratic Primary with 6,388 votes, which was 81% of the vote total. In the general election on November 8, 2016, Schor was re-elected for his final term, receiving 28,373 votes (72.88% of the vote total). He defeated Republican nominee Randy Pilon, who had received 8,365 votes (21.49% of the vote total), and Libertarian nominee Robert Powell, who had received 2,132 votes (5.48% of the vote total).\n\n\n\nIn 2016, there were rumors that Rep. Schor was considering running against current Lansing Mayor  in the upcoming election in 2017. Due to state legislative term limits, he had to leave the state House at the end of the 2018 session. Schor responded to the rumors stating that \"If I run for mayor, it's because I want to be mayor, not because I need a job,\" he said. Schor added that he'd only want to be mayor if he concludes \"it's best for the city.\"\n\nIn February 2017, Schor announced his primary run for mayor of Lansing. Around the same time, Mayor Bernero said in a press release that he was \"prepared\" to reapply for \"my job\" for a fourth term. A few days later, Bernero announced that he would not be seeking a fourth term so he can spend more time with his family.

The newly-elected Mayor Schor, would go on to take office Jan 1, leaving his House seat vacant in 2018. Schor was elected to serve as the city's first  mayor. The mayor-elect’s comprehensive plan going into his first year had four main focus areas. It showed: \"(1) Neighborhoods will be safe, inviting, and strong with amenities for youth and families like good parks. (2) Economic and community development will address commercial corridors as well as downtown, focusing on growth and job opportunities with common sense regulations and talent retention. (3) Roads and sidewalks fixes will be prioritized neighborhood-by neighborhood, and police and fire will be a budget priority. (4) The City will work with Lansing schools to ensure and show that children can receive a great education in Lansing.\"\n\nIn 2021, Schor ran for re-election, finishing as the top candidate in the primary election.

Mayor Schor is not up for re-election until 2025, and he has not yet publicly announced if he will seek a third term.\n\n\nIn November 2017, then mayor-elect Schor announced his city hall appointments. He appointed Samantha Harkins as Chief of Staff, Jennifer LeFevre as Office Manager, Chelsea Coffey as Special Assistant to the Mayor, and Marilyn Plummer as Community Outreach Coordinator. Schor also appointed 12 members of his cabinet to oversee the city's departments, eight of whom worked for former Mayor Virg Bernero’s administration. Linda Sanchez Gazella as director of human resources, Andrew Kilpatrick as public service director, Angela Bennett remained overseer of the Finance Department, Collin Boyce remained chief information officer, Tammy Good remained treasurer, Joan Jackson-Johnson continued to head the Human Relations and Community Services Department, Brett Kaschinske continued as director of parks and recreation, Jim Smiertka continued as city attorney, Randy Talifarro continued as chief of the Lansing's Fire Department, Mike Yankowski continued to run the Lansing Police Department. Under Schor’s new plan, he split the Department of Planning and Neighborhood Development into two cabinet-level departments: one Economic Development and Planning, appointing Brian McGrain to oversee the department, the other Neighborhoods and Citizen Engagement, and appointed Andrea Crawford to run the new department.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that Schor would appoint Darlene Fancher to the Capital Area Transportation Authority Board for a term that lasted until September 30, 2022, Gillian Dawson to the Elected Officers Compensation Commission for a term lasting until October 1, 2027, Thomas Patrick Morgan to the Planning Board for a term that would expire on June 30, 2024, and Samuel Brewster to the Police Board of Commissioners for a term lasting through 2024. Additionally, he announced multiple names for the Mayor’s Racial Justice and Equity Alliance including Brenda Henderson, Dr. Farhan Bhatti, Dr. Renee Canady, Dr. Fareeha Naz, Travis Harris, and Karen Tate. All of their terms expired on August 1, 2021. Schor also announced several new appointments for his upcoming term after winning reelection including Matthew Horwitt to the Board of Water and Light, Cordelia Black to a member of the Human Relations and Community Services as well as Andrew Abood to the Police Board of Commissioners. All terms will expire on June 30, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, as a Michigan state representative, Schor introduced bills that involved the advertisement of marijuana in Michigan. This bill, House Bill 4767 and Senate Bill 463 would ban billboard advertisements for medical marijuana and dispensaries and other businesses that involve marijuana. Schor was quoted as saying that Michigan doesn’t “need massive marijuana billboard advertising the availability of medical marijuana or to find shops, and shouldn’t be advertising this to our children and others who may abuse it”.\n\n\nA proposal announced by Mayor Schor in June 2020 would change the number of marijuana retailers from 25 to 28. The changes an amendment to the city of Lansing's ordinance to add recreational marijuana to the kinds of marijuana businesses allowed in Lansing. In an interview for the  in 2018, the interviewer discusses how the city of Lansing faced an ordinance problem that limited the amount of dispensaries that were allowed to be in business. In the time before he was mayor there was an ordinance that only allowed a certain number of marijuana dispensaries within city limits.\n\n\nAs a response to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus in March 2020, Schor released an internal COVID-19 mitigation plan in order to slow the spread of the disease. This plan suspended nonessential business travel outside of Clinton, Ingham and Eaton County, employees that present any COVID symptoms are expected to remain home, as well as departments providing supplies such as gloves, hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, as well as tissues.\n\nIn March 2022, Andy Schor tested positive for Covid-19. Schor got his COVID-19 vaccination in January 2021, at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing. He was able to receive an early vaccine, and was one of two-hundred that were given early access to the vaccine.\n\n\nIn April 2020, Andy Schor created the job of Sustainability Manager for the city of Lansing. To this position, Schor appointed former environmental specialist, Lori Welch, to the newly created position. The purpose of this position is to implement sustainability plans and to create more environmentally focused strategies for the city of Lansing.\n\n\n\nIn May 2021, Schor called for an independent review of the Police Department of Lansing, asking for assessments of their use of force, de-escalation strategies, officer wellness, arrest management, as well as body cameras and police bias. This was in response to widespread public protests nationwide concerning the , in which he was found guilty in the .\n\nIn 2021, Schor released the Mayor's Report on Racial Justice and Equity. This document acted as an outline to steps to work towards a higher level of racial justice within the Lansing police department. These steps included Schor signing the “8cantwait pledge”, Obama’s Mayoral Pledge, as well as adjusting Lansing Police Departments policing policies regarding traffic stops and “no knock” searches. The “8cantwait pledge” bans certain policing procedures such as strangling and choke holding individuals.\n\nIn 2021, Lansing police counted 45 homicides, 112 non-fatal shootings and more than 1,000 gunshot reports over the last two years and city officials pointed the blame largely toward an influx of illegal firearms. At the end of the year, Mayor Schor announced a plan to hire five more officers and an additional social worker at the Police Department, and that they had launched a gun violence task force.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Rep. Schor introduced House Bill 4104 that would have closed the loophole in Michigan's gun law that allows a concealed weapons license holder to openly carry a gun in gun-free zones such as schools, churches, daycares, and more. The bill would have also added public libraries as a part of the “gun free zone” provision of the concealed pistol permit law, something that was added in response to several incidents of individuals openly carrying guns in the Capital Area District Library’s downtown branch. Schor's bill didn’t make it out of committees under the Republican House majority.\n\nRep. Schor, a gun owner himself, said \"I support all of our citizens' right to keep and bear arms, but I also ... feel strongly about ensuring that concealed and open-carry guns are not allowed in very sensitive areas.\"\n\n\nIn 2022, Schor implemented an ordinance that required owners of firearms to report stolen guns in the city to the Lansing Police Department. The failure of an owner to not report the theft of a firearm is a civil infraction and is subject to a fine of up to $500. Schor justified the ordinance by saying “Illegal guns on our streets have had a devastating effect on so many lives in our community.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a State Representative, Schor was interested in \"talent retention,\" encouraging recent graduates from state-supported colleges and universities to stay and work in the state of Michigan. In 2013, he introduced House Bill 4182, which would have provided tax credits on student loan payments for recent graduates from Michigan universities or colleges, including two-year institutions. Schor proposed House Bill 4844, which would have allowed school districts to start their school year before Labor Day, but also mandate to take Labor Day as well as the proceeding Friday off. In 2013, Schor also spearheaded House Bill 4982 that would have allowed for the transition of Michigan schools to move to a year round schedule. Schor strongly advocated for the year round schedule as he believes that vital information during the three months off of school. A quote from Schor regarding his policies:\n\n''“It is well-known and proven that students lose what they have learned in the three months that they are away from school in the summer. It takes at least a month or two (September and October) for students to regain what they lose over the summer, which means that 30 to 60 of our mandated 175 days are used for catch-up and not learning new material. Add to that the fact that at-risk children don’t have the availability or ability to attend educational camps in the summer, and that makes a recipe for failure and low-performing schools.” ''\n\nHis proposed bill would create a fund of ten million dollars, that at-risk districts that want to convert to all year system can have access to, to help them achieve this. This bill would help incentivize Michigan schools to move to the year round system. This money would help schools prepare for summer months because many schools lack proper air conditioning that is needed for summer schooling. Due to the full Republican control of the State House, State Senate, and Governors seat at the time, all three of these bills didn’t make it out of committees.\n\n\nMayor Schor's children both attend Lansing Schools, and he has been a vocal booster and supporter for the school district. As mayor, Schor has tried to draw positive attention to the schools and work on increasing attendance and support for young families moving into the city. \n\nIn response to gun violence in the city, Schor rolled out several grant-funding opportunities to help create more afterschool activities. In 2021, the city partnered with school district officials, opened up community centers and pledged more than $250,000 toward a gun violence intervention program in 2022, to combat the rise in teenage homicides in the city.\n\nIn August 2022, Mayor Schor announced a $400,000 pledge of American Rescue Plan money over the next two years to be used to help students finish high school. This investment is intended to create a stronger relationship between the Lansing School District and the City of Lansing.\n\n\nSchor has argued that the persistence of the homelessness problem in Lansing is a result of insufficient social safety nets. Schor claims that substance abuse plays a major role in this equation and that homeless shelters do not have adequate means of providing a solution for that issue. Additionally, Schor has advocated for putting the homeless in apartments and providing them with resources such as healthcare and education.\n\nIn 2019, the city accepted 's 2014 \"Mayor's Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness,\" working with federal agencies to reduce the number of homeless veterans within the city. Under the Schor administration, the city saw a 64% reduction in homelessness veterans in a year, with city services put in place to help them. Schor responded saying, \"I assure you that we are well-aware there are still homeless veterans living in our community,\" going on to say \"We also know that the systems that we put in place work.”\n\nIn December 2020, Schor endorsed the clearance of Lansing’s “Back 40” homeless encampment due to unsanitary living conditions. This was done on the condition that the city’s top priority was to “provide safe living conditions and avoid tragedy” for the individuals previously staying at the camp. The city of Lansing provided grants totaling 1.8 million dollars to four different agencies to help the homeless or near homeless find housing.\n\n\n\n\nAs a State Representative, Schor introduced a few pieces of legislation that boosted the flexibility and growth of breweries in Michigan. Schor regards that \"these bills are another attempt to create more jobs and support growth in what has become one of our state's great local industries,\" and that \"Our craft brewery industry is hugely important for economic development here in Michigan.\" One of the pieces of legislation that was signed into law, HB 4711, allows brewers to sell their beer for on-premise consumption at two brewery locations instead of one, with the intent of breweries and microbreweries having more opportunities to expand in Michigan.\n\nIn 2017, Rep. Schor introduced House Bill 4207, which aimed to incentivize the development of grocery stores in underserved cities. The bill allocated grant funding to help create new neighborhood grocery stores in underserved urban areas or to help redevelop existing neighborhood grocery stores. This bipartisan bill was signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* ''official city government site''\n* ''official campaign site''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She was the Democratic nominee for  in the , alongside former Congressman .\n\n\nBrown was born in  and graduated from  in  in 1985. She received a BS in psychology from  in 1989, and went on to earn her Juris Doctor from the  in 1993. While at law school, she served as a clerk for two law firms. Brown practiced law for several years, handling probate issues. She then worked as a realtor with Max Broock Realtors in .\n\nPrior to her election, she served on the PTA of West Hills Middle School and Pine Lake Elementary School. She is Jewish and attends Adat Shalom, a Conservative Synagogue in . She served on the region board of directors and is a life member of , a \"non-profit non-governmental organization whose mission is the advancement of Jewish and other people through training and education\". She also served on the executive board of directors of JARC.\n\n\nIn 2006, Brown began a campaign as a Democrat for Michigan's 39th State House District, which was then held by Republican incumbent David Law.  Brown was originally the underdog, especially as she had no prior electoral experience. On election day, however, she nearly scored an upset over Law, losing by only 181 votes (0.5%).\n\nIn 2008, Law decided not to run for a third term, instead unsuccessfully campaigning to become Oakland County Prosecutor.\n\nBrown announced her intention to run for this 39th District again. Democrat John Kuriakuz challenged her in the Democratic primary. Brown emerged victorious with 57% of the vote. In the general election she faced Republican Walled Lake School Board President Amy Peterman. The 39th District includes all of Commerce Township and all but a small northern portion of West Bloomfield Township. Both parties spent heavily on the race, and Peterman was endorsed by the ''''. On election day, Brown narrowly beat Peterman by a 51.6%-46.1% margin. She took office on January 1, 2009. She sat on the Education, Energy and Technology, Ethics and Elections, and Judiciary Committees. She authored a bill that banned the recreational drug .\n\nIn the November 2010 election, after an initial declaration of victory by her opponent, a review of the final tally was started. Her opponent, Lois Shulman, had declared victory before thousands of absentee ballots were counted. Ultimately, Brown prevailed by a margin of 86 votes (17,137 to 17,051).\n\nBrown was elected county clerk and register of deeds on November 6, 2012, defeating Republican Willis C. Bullard, Jr., who had been appointed clerk in 2010 by the Oakland County Commissioners to fill a remainder term. Upon taking office, Brown became a defendant in a federal lawsuit, '''', in which a lesbian couple, residents of Oakland County, are challenging Michigan's denial of adoption and marriage rights to same-sex couples. Named as a defendant because her office is responsible for issuing marriage licenses, she has supported the plaintiffs and expressed an eagerness to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples as soon as the law allows.\n\n\nIn June 2012, Michigan House Republicans prevented Brown from speaking on the floor in a debate about  legislation after she invoked her  faith as a point of debate on the subject and concluded by saying, \"Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but no means no.\" Majority Floor Leader , R-Midland, determined Brown's comments violated the decorum of the House and barred her from speaking for a one-day period. Brown was gaveled off the floor and prohibited from speaking along with Representative , who proposed a ban on vasectomies. Democrats called the incident evidence that Republicans were trampling on women's rights, with Senator  saying \"the  in Michigan is not fabricated – this is very real – and it comes at the highest levels of state government.\" On June 14, the '''' quoted Callton's take on Brown's comments. \"What she said was offensive ... It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company,\" he said. \"It's just an extremely offensive statement.\" Callton, who is also Jewish, said he consulted his  and believes Brown's interpretation of the  as it relates to abortion is incorrect.\n\nThe bill that prompted Brown's comments was passed by a vote of 70–39, with one representative not voting.\n\n\n\nBrown later stated: \"I was either banned for being Jewish and rightfully pointing out that HB 5711 was forcing contradictory religious beliefs upon me and my religion. Or is it because I used the word 'vagina,' which is an anatomically, medically correct term?\" On June 19, 2012, Representative  provided the GOP viewpoint, characterizing both of female representatives as \"kids\" who were \"throwing temper tantrums\" and in need of \"time outs.\" House Speaker  stated that by referencing vagina, and then saying 'no means no', thereby making a rape reference, is .

He represented the 3rd house district located in , which comprises the north central and eastern portions of .  After serving on the House Judiciary, Commerce, Economic Development and Trade, Insurance, and Criminal Justice committees, Olumba served on the House Appropriations Committee as the chairman of Fiscal Oversight, and as a member on Community Health, and Corrections.\n\n\nOlumba was born in Detroit and lived mostly on its east side with his mother and four sisters.  He attended Miller Middle School, a school popularized by other well known politicians in Detroit such as Coleman Young and Erma Henderson. Olumba attended high school at (Lewis) Cass Technical High School in Detroit and is a graduate of the  with dual concentrations in  and .

Following an unsuccessful first bid for the state house in 2008 and a run for the Detroit charter commission, Olumba worked as a school administrator. Olumba won on his second attempt at being a representative.\n\n\n\nJohn Olumba met Charsha Mauldin while in undergrad at the University of Michigan.  They were married in 2008 after she returned from Peace Corps service in West Africa.  They have had six children: Eliezra, Keziah, Azariah, Emmanuel, Jubilee, and Ephraim. He is also a preacher of the gospel.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014 Olumba earned the chairmanship over the house appropriations subcommittee of fiscal oversight. Perhaps historical, this marks one of the first times where a representative not in the majority party maintained a chairmanship of a committee.\n\n\nAs a representative, Olumba's notoriety increased after formally initiating a federal investigation into the offices of  Executive  and reports of backlash surfaced. Olumba said he received threatening phone calls and elected officials visited him at his home uninvited in order to coerce him into retracting his investigation. Olumba said two of his Democratic colleagues handed him a retraction letter on the floor of the House of Representatives that he eventually handed over to federal authorities. Thus far, the investigation has yielded two indictments and one conviction.\n\nToward the end of his first term, Olumba also sought an investigation by the Michigan Attorney General into Detroit Mayor  over money he said was misappropriated from two city departments.\n\n\n\nIn August 2010, Olumba won the state's most crowded primary with 16 people seeking office by a 2 to 1 margin over the closest competitor.

Although Olumba is a native of Detroit, Olumba's father migrated to Detroit from Africa as a student-activist during the  and, once elected, Olumba became the first Nigerian elected to a state office in Michigan history.\n\nOlumba caused controversy within the Michigan House Democratic Caucus when he accused the caucus of allowing the Emergency Manager Law Public Act 4 to pass with immediate effect when they could have blocked its passage by engaging in a filibuster. Olumba is also known for his introduction of a series of bills he named the Detroit Reinvestment and Restructuring Omnibus designed to revitalize the city. It is the largest bill package intended for the municipality in history.\n\nOlumba served on the House Judiciary and Commerce Committees in addition to a special subcommittee on Economic Development and Trade.\n\n\n\nIn his first term, Olumba represented the  which also included the cities of  and . Olumba was redistricted into the  and, following a contentious primary election in which Olumba defeated another incumbent, Olumba won the general with 96 percent of the vote. The 3rd district is the only entirely Detroit house district.\n\nOn February 19, 2013, Olumba began to work independently as a Democrat, citing the lack of an urban or African American agenda by the Michigan House Democrats. Olumba argued that Detroit is the highest tax entity in the state yet, there are no African Americans or Detroiters on the Tax Policy Committee and they are underrepresented on the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\n\n\n  |votes      = 11,763\n |percentage = 89.71\n  |change     = 0.0\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  |votes      = 33,938\n  |percentage = 95.56\n  |change     = 0.0\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(née Kastl; 1903–1990), a teacher and William Herman Knollenberg Jr. (1902–1975), a farmer. He was raised a Catholic and grew up on a farm along with 12 siblings. He graduated from  in 1955, where he was a member of  Fraternity.\n\nAfter graduation, he served in the  from 1955 to 1957 as a corporal in Germany, where he specialized in petroleum chemistry. He then spent more than three decades as an insurance agent. Initially working for  as an assistant manager and later for , he founded his own agency, Knollenberg Agency in the late 1980s. He served as chairman of the Oakland County Republican Party from 1978 to 1982.\n\n\nIn 1992, Knollenberg signed on as campaign manager for Congressman , who had represented most of Oakland County in Congress since 1957. However, at a meeting with Knollenberg and other advisers, Broomfield announced he would not run for a 19th term. He then asked Knollenberg to run in his place in the 11th District, which had been renumbered from the 18th District after the 1990 census.\n\nDespite being the only candidate in the three-way Republican primary not holding elected office, Knollenberg won the nomination by over 13 points. As the 11th was one of the most Republican districts in Michigan and the nation at the time, he was virtually assured of becoming only the third person to represent the district. He was reelected six times without serious difficulty, never dropping below 55 percent of the vote.\n\nKnollenberg was re-elected to his seventh term in 2004 with 58% of the vote.

The narrowness of his 2006 reelection bid, combined with his district's changing demographics led the  to target him for defeat. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee targeted Congressional Districts where Republicans garnered less than 55% of the vote.\n\nThe Democratic nominee was , the former state lottery commissioner.

Knollenberg's candidacy was likely hurt by a heavy Democratic tide in the Detroit area;  carried Oakland County by a 15-point margin, six percentage points more than Peters' margin over Knollenberg. A potential factor in Knollenberg's defeat was a series of advertisements criticizing his vote against expanding .\n\n\nKnollenberg had two sons, Stephen and Martin with his wife, Sandra \"Sandie\" Moco, whom he married in September 1962 at St Frances Cabrini Church in .

A member of the , he previously served as the  for  from 1993 to 2011.\n\nBorn in the , Hoekstra immigrated to the United States as a child. In 1992, Hoekstra ran for the U.S. House, defeating thirteen-term incumbent  in the Republican primary and  opponent John H. Miltner in the general election. Hoekstra was the chairman of the  from 2004 to 2007. He was a candidate for governor in , but came in second to  in the Republican primary. Hoekstra was also the Republican nominee for the  in 2012, losing to Democratic incumbent  in the .\n\nIn July 2017, Hoekstra was nominated to be  by President . This nomination was confirmed by the  on November 9, 2017, and Hoekstra was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador on December 11, 2017. He took office on January 10, 2018. He left office on January 17, 2021.\n\nOn January 20, 2024, Hoekstra was elected chair of the .\n\n\nHoekstra was born Cornelis Piet Hoekstra in , Netherlands. He moved to the U.S. with his parents at the age of three, and Anglicized his name to '''Peter Hoekstra.''' He graduated from  (Holland, Michigan) in 1971. He received a  in  from  in 1975 and an  from the 's  in 1977. He then joined office furniture maker  and remained there for 15 years, eventually becoming vice president of marketing.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992, Hoekstra made his first bid for public office in the 2nd District. The district, previously the 9th, had been represented for 26 years by , longtime chairman of the . Hoekstra rode his  across the district, charging that Vander Jagt had served in Congress for too long; Vander Jagt had won his first election in 1966, when Hoekstra was 13 years old. He scored a monumental upset, winning by almost six percent. Hoekstra dominated the district's more populated southern portion; Vander Jagt's margins in the northern portion, his longtime base, weren't enough to close the gap. This primary win was  in a district reckoned as Michigan's most Republican district; the GOP has held the district for all but four years since it was created in 1873. Hoekstra later defeated  John H. Miltner and  Dick Jacobs in the general election, with 63% of the vote. Hoekstra continued to ride his bicycle across the district every summer, and biked across the state for his gubernatorial campaign.\n\nWhen he was first elected, Hoekstra initially pledged to serve no more than six terms (12 years) in the House. However, in 2004, he announced he would break that pledge and seek a seventh term. In 2006, Hoekstra's Leadership PAC (the Mileage Fund) raised nearly $160,000 in Political Action Contributions from contributors including the , Michigan Credit Union League, and Little Planet Books.\n\nHoekstra faced no significant opposition in the Republican primary or in the general election (as in his previous five reelection campaigns) and went on to secure his seventh term. Shortly after the primary, he was named chairman of the Intelligence Committee, succeeding , who became .\n\n\n\nHoekstra had no primary opponent. In November he was opposed by the  candidate Kimon Kotos, who was also his 2004 opponent. Hoekstra defeated Kotos 183,518 votes to 87,361 votes.\n\n\nHoekstra ran for re-election in 2008 against Fred Johnson, associate professor of History at . He beat Johnson by 215,471 to 119,959 votes.\n\n\nHoekstra had a conservative voting record, consistent with the conservative nature of the 2nd congressional district. He opposed abortion rights, opposed expanding health care benefits for children, opposed gay adoption rights and gay marriage, and voted against paid parental leave for federal employees. However, he also opposed amending the  to prohibit .\n\n\nHoekstra consistently opposed  during his tenure, earning an A rating from the . In 2005 he voted to prohibit product lawsuits against gun manufacturers. In 1994 he voted against the .\n\n\nHoekstra was a proponent of the claim that the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), and held onto this belief even after no WMDs were found in the wake of the Iraq invasion. In 2006, Hoekstra made headlines by announcing at a press conference in the Capitol that  had been located in  in the form of 500 s. However, the weapons in question were defunct munitions, manufactured prior to the 1991 Gulf War and which had been scattered throughout Iraq. The media had already reported on these munitions when Hoekstra made his announcement that the weapons had been discovered. Hoekstra's insistence that the Hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction were disputed by both  officials, the , and the intelligence community.\n\nOn November 3, 2006, '''' reported that a website created at the request of Hoekstra and   was found to contain detailed information that could potentially be helpful to those seeking to produce s. The website was shut down on November 2 following questioning by ''The New York Times''.\n\nAs of September 17, 2007, some news outlets reported that the Congressional committee Hoekstra had overseen had created \"erroneous\" and \"misleading\" reports about Iran's nuclear capabilities. \"Among the committee's assertions is that Iran is producing weapons-grade uranium at its facility in the town of Natanz. The IAEA called that \"incorrect\", noting that weapons-grade uranium is enriched to a level of 90 percent or more. Iran has enriched uranium to 3.5 percent under IAEA monitoring.\"\n\n\nDuring the ,  were discovered by the U.S. military.  In March 2006, the U.S. government, at the urging of members of Congress, made them available online at its  website, requesting Arabic translators around the world to help in the translation.  On April 18, 2006, about a month after the first documents were made public, Hoekstra, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a news release acknowledging \"minimal risks,\" but saying the site \"will enable us to better understand information such as 's links to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and violence against the Iraqi people.\" He added: \"It will allow us to leverage the Internet to enable a mass examination as opposed to limiting it to a few exclusive elites.\"\n\nIn early November 2006, the entire set of documents was removed. Media reports stated that the website was taken offline because of security concerns regarding the posting of sophisticated diagrams and other information regarding nuclear weapon design prior to the .\n\n\nOn December 27, 2009, Hoekstra commented on reports that , who had allegedly tried to set off a  on  on December 25, 2009, had subsequently confessed to being trained and equipped in Yemen.\nHoekstra called for a halt to the repatriation of .\n\n\nHoekstra was a founding member of the Congressional House  in 2010.\n\n\n* ''''''\n** As ranking member of the full committee, Rep.

Hoekstra joined , the Oakland County Sheriff and former state senator, former  president , State Senator  and Michigan Attorney General  as 2010 Republican gubernatorial candidates. In the primary, held on August 3, 2010, Hoekstra finished second to Snyder.\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoekstra was suggested as a possible challenger for Democratic incumbent  in the , but he initially declined to run. Hoekstra later changed his mind and decided to challenge Stabenow in the election. On August 29, 2011, Hoekstra was endorsed by Republican Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, and on September 23, 2011, Hoekstra was endorsed by  .\n\nHoekstra faced Stabenow and four third-party candidates in the general election. On November 6, 2012, Hoekstra was defeated by Stabenow, receiving 38% of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoekstra targeted Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow with a television ad which ran statewide during the . The 30-second ad, created by Republican advertising consultant , opened with the sound of a gong and the image of a Chinese woman (played by 2012 Miss Napa Valley Lisa Chan) riding a bike alongside a rice . The ad sarcastically accused Stabenow of contributing to the U.S.' spending problem, with the woman thanking \"Michigan Senator Debbie Spenditnow\", in , implying Stabenow has earned China's gratitude for making the U.S. economy \"very weak\" while China's \"get very good\".\n\nThe commercial included a link to a Hoekstra campaign website with statistics about federal spending, decorated with images of Chinese flags and currency and using a stereotypical  font. In the  code on Hoekstra's site, the woman in the ad is identified as \"yellowgirl\". A statement released by the Hoekstra campaign said the  code was mistakenly shortened from \"yellowshirtgirl\".\n\nAsian-American groups called the ad \"very disturbing\", and two of Hoekstra's GOP opponents,  and Gary Glenn, questioned whether Hoekstra was the right candidate for Republicans to support. The ad was criticized by , former aide to  , a member of the , and U.S. Senator .  of '''' called it the \"most revolting ad\". The  denounced the ad as an \"unnecessary .\"\n\nThe ad proved costly for Hoekstra; several polls reported him losing ground to Stabenow in a head-to-head match-up.\n\nHoekstra initially stood by the ad, claiming it hit Stabenow \"smack dab between the eyes\" on the economy.  However, on February 10, 2012, Hoekstra shut down his controversial Chinese-themed website and phased in a new TV commercial in place of his original ad.  American Values super PAC, an Asian American group, claimed credit for the scrub shortly after the group's launch of an online viral ad condemning Hoekstra.\n\nOn February 16, Chan apologized for her involvement in the ad. In a statement on her  page, she said the role was \"not in any way representative of who I am\" and \"absolutely a mistake on my part.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Hoekstra won the Republican primary. He lost to Stabenow in the general election.\n\n\nIn February 2011, Hoekstra joined the government relations group and  law firm , and was named a visiting distinguished fellow at the conservative  , concentrating on education reform.  In 2014, Hoekstra left Dickstein Shapiro to join one of its rivals, .\n\nHoekstra joined 's Investigative Project on Terrorism in 2014 as a  Senior Fellow, specializing in national security, international relations, global terrorism and cyber security.\n\nHoekstra published his first book in October 2015, ''Architects of Disaster: The Destruction of Libya'' with Terri Blumenfeld.\n\nIn an interview with NPR's Robert Siegel on December 10, 2014, Hoekstra said he disagreed with the recently released .\n\n's KFile reported that Hoekstra in 2016 accused  of ties with the . A 2016 ''''  gave that claim \"four \". CNN also stated that Hoekstra was a frequent guest on a talk show hosted by , an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist based in Washington.\n\nOn March 11, 2017, Hoekstra said that , , and other leakers of government materials, having illegally released classified information, were traitors and should have taken their evidence to the intelligence committees of the U.S. Congress for proper investigations.\n\n\nOn July 24, 2017, President  nominated Hoekstra to be . He was confirmed by the Senate on November 9 via voice vote and sworn in by Vice President  on December 11, 2017. He took office on January 10, 2018.\n\n\n\nLater that December,  U.S. correspondent Wouter Zwart questioned Hoekstra about inaccurate claims that he had made in November 2015 at a panel titled \"Muslim Migration into Europe: Eurabia come True?\" hosted by the  that the Netherlands had \"\" and that politicians and cars were being set on fire in the country due to . Hoekstra told Zwart that he had never said such things, saying, \"we would call it . I never said that.\" Zwart then played the clip in which he made those remarks for his viewers. Later in the interview, Hoekstra denied that he denied it, saying \"I didn't call it 'fake news'. I didn't use those words today.\" On December 23, Hoekstra issued an apology on , writing that he \"made certain remarks in 2015 and regret[ted] the exchange during the '''' interview\".\n\nOn January 10, 2018, during his press conference after presenting his credentials to King , Hoekstra said that he did not want to revisit the comments made in 2015. Despite repeated questions from Dutch reporters regarding these comments, Hoekstra refused to talk about these statements and refused to answer further questions.\n\nOn January 11, 2018,   said that in 2015, Hoekstra \"made comments that should not have been made\", that \"the State Department does not agree with those statements\" and \"that is not the language we would use.\" He added that the \"comments were wrong and don't reflect the U.S. view of the Netherlands\". One day later, in an interview with Dutch newspaper '''', Hoekstra finally retracted his statement about the presence of \"no-go zones\" in the Netherlands where cars and politicians are being set on fire, saying: \"Looking back, I'm dismayed that I said it. It was an incorrect statement. It was just wrong.\" He further claimed that he could not recall how he got to the statement or what it was based on, saying: \"I've mixed up countries. I was wrong, and I don't know how that could have happened. I do know: it was wrong.\"\n\n\nIn September 2020, a group of Dutch officials demanded answers from Hoekstra in response to reports that he had hosted a fund-raising event at the U.S. embassy for the far right Dutch political party , a potential violation of international law. This is not the first time Hoekstra has been associated with the far-right party. In May 2020, Hoekstra was interviewed by party leader  on the party's video channel and he was also a guest speaker at the party's conference in November 2019.\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n*  ''IPT (Investigative Project on Terrorism)''\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n()|years=}}\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She previously served on the Eastpointe City Council from 2017 to 2019 and was the first  to serve in either office. She was unseated in the 2023 mayoral primary.\n\nHer tenure as mayor was controversial and included a lawsuit alleging that she violated residents' First Amendment rights and a criminal conviction for making false statements on a grant application for her business. Residents also objected to police reports she made against critics, her failure to file financial disclosure statements, her heated tirades against residents and other officials during meetings, and her lack of support for the LGBT community.\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Owens pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of making a false statement. The case, which was originally charged as felony false pretenses, stemmed from a COVID business relief application which stated that her business was 51 percent or more owned by veterans and had 100–249 employees. After paying $10,000 in restitution to the victim, she was sentenced to six months of probation, 100 hours of community service, and $725 in court costs.\n\n\n\nOwens started her career as a clerical employee with the  and later served as a 's deputy for 11 years. The Wayne County Sheriff's Office suspended Owens in 2010.\n\n\nOwens moved from  to Eastpointe in 2010.\n\n\nIn 2017, Owens was elected to the Eastpointe City Council, the first African-American to serve as councilperson in the city.\n\nEarlier that year, the U.S. Department of Justice had filed a lawsuit alleging that the city's election of council members at-large violated the . The lawsuit was settled after Owens was elected to council and resulted in the city using ranked-choice voting for council elections beginning in 2019.\n\n\nOwens was the only council member to vote \"no\" on the city's Pride Month resolution in 2019, saying that Eastpointe has \"always accepted everybody\". After becoming mayor, she voted against similar resolutions in both 2020 and 2021. Owens did not attend the council meeting where the 2023 Pride Month resolution was voted on.\n\nAs mayor, Owens attended a Feb. 2020 speech by  which included anti-LGBT remarks.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, incumbent mayor Suzanne Pixley did not file to run for re-election. On November 5, 2019, Owens was narrowly elected mayor with 32.5 percent of the vote in a five-way contest. She received 19 more votes than runner-up Mike Klinefelt.\n\n\nIn July 2021, Owens applied for a poverty exemption from property taxes on her home in Eastpointe. The Eastpointe Board of Review later granted the mayor a 100 percent exemption from property taxes in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Owens applied for a tax exemption again, but the Eastpointe Board of Review denied the exemption for 2022 on the grounds that her income exceeded the guidelines for a poverty exemption. Owens appealed the board's decision to the Michigan Tax Tribunal, which in February 2023 issued a judgment upholding the city's denial of the exemption. Paperwork submitted by Owens to the tribunal claimed that her annual income was less than $12,000. Judge Patricia Halm, however, noted that the testimony and evidence considered by the tribunal showed income of $43,695. Tax records reviewed by the ''Macomb Daily'' shortly after the decision showed that Owens owed $3,378 for summer and winter 2022 property taxes. On Feb. 28, 2023, Owens's 2022 property taxes were paid via two separate credit cards, according to city records.\n\nIn 2023, Owens applied for the tax exemption a third time. The board of review denied the request.\n\n\nIn 2021, Owens applied for the full-time city manager position in . In September, the city extended Owens a conditional job offer, which she accepted on September 30. Owens expressed her intent to remain mayor of Eastpointe while working as city manager of Harper Woods. The following day, the mayor of Harper Woods announced that Owens did not meet the conditions of the contract. As a result, Owens did not receive the job.\n\n\nIn October 2021, Eastpointe Community Schools board member Mary Hall-Rayford criticized Owens for her behavior at the Michigan Military Technical & Historical Society Museum. ''The Macomb Daily'' reported that Owens brought someone to tour the museum during hours when it was closed to the public and that she entered areas that were restricted to museum employees only. The museum is privately owned and operated but leases a building from the city. Museum staff also complained that Owens violated the museum's policy prohibiting beverages near the exhibits and that she refused to comply when reminded of the rule. MMTHS board member Wendy Richardson said that she filmed Owens' visit using a cell phone due to legal concerns. Owens objected to the recording and alleged that museum staff had violated her rights by filming her.\n\n\nIn Eastpointe's 2021 general election, Owens endorsed Shenita Lloyd and Michael Jones for city council. Both candidates were defeated by Cardi DeMonaco, an incumbent, and Rob Baker, who had previously served a partial term on the council.\n\nThat same day, voters also approved a city charter amendment requiring the city to hold a mayoral primary if more than two candidates run for mayor in the same election.\n\n\nThe Eastpointe City Council voted 3-1 to censure Owens at its April 5, 2022, meeting.\n\n\nOwens filed on April 15 to run for the Republican nomination for state senate in the 11th district. Four days later, she withdrew from the Republican primary and filed to run in the Democratic primary in the same district.\n\nOn June 18, Owens attended the opening ceremonies of Cruisin' Gratiot, an annual car cruise hosted by a nonprofit in Eastpointe. As the ceremonies ended, Owens approached the microphone and spoke to the crowd against the organization's wishes. Harvey Curley, an 80 year-old longtime Cruisin' Gratiot board member who is also a city councilman, then confronted Owens. She later reported the incident to police, alleging that Curley had assaulted her. The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office dismissed the case.\n\nOwens also filed for a personal protective order against Curley. On September 23, 2022, Macomb County Circuit Court Judge Rachel Rancilio denied Owens’s request, saying in her decision that no evidence was taken at the hearing that would demonstrate that Curley is dangerous.\n\n'''' endorsed Owens in the primary. '''' endorsed her opponent in the primary, citing Owens' \"oddly malleable\" values and expressing concern that she may switch her party affiliation again.\n\nOwens lost the Democratic primary election to  by a nearly two-to-one margin.\n\n\nDuring the 2022 state senate campaign, Owens claimed in a Ballotpedia candidate survey that she had a bachelor's degree in political science. The Macomb Daily, however, reported that she had a bachelor's degree in criminal justice.\n\n\nIn 2022, Owens was named as a defendant in a federal lawsuit alleging that she violated the civil rights of four constituents by interrupting or censoring their remarks during public comment time at council meetings.\n\nAt the council's September 6, 2022, meeting, Owens repeatedly interrupted and talked over residents during the public comment section of the meeting, objecting that speakers may not discuss a police matter involving Owens and another council member, Harvey Curley. The city's attorney advised the council that they may not restrict a speaker's subject matter, except for racial accusations and similar remarks. When Owens continued to interrupt subsequent speakers and raise her voice, all four council members walked out in protest, leaving Owens alone at the table and effectively ending the meeting.\n\nOn November 9, 2022, the  filed suit in the  in Detroit, naming Owens and the City of Eastpointe as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that Owens violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of four residents who attempted to speak during public comment periods at meetings by shouting them down, berating them, and otherwise preventing them from speaking. In addition to the three plaintiffs who attempted to speak during the public comment period of the September 6 meeting, a fourth plaintiff alleged similar treatment during a March 2022 meeting. The lawsuit further alleged that Owens frequently uses her authority “to suppress dissent and criticism by interrupting and shouting down members of the public who criticize her or raise subjects she finds personally embarrassing”. The lawsuit's stated purpose is to “stop Mayor Owens’s abuse of authority”.\n\nOn December 8, 2022, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, which the City agreed to, prohibiting Owens from shouting down speakers or restricting the subject matter of their remarks. The order is to remain in effect until the case is resolved or the court orders otherwise.\n\n\nOn December 13, 2022, the Eastpointe Board of Ethics voted 3-0 (with one abstention) to verify a resident's ethics complaint against Owens which alleged that she had failed to file annual financial disclosures required under the city's ethics ordinance. At the time of the complaint, Owens had not filed a disclosure form since 2017.\n\nOn January 30, 2023, the Ethics Board directed the city manager to issue a formal letter to Owens requesting that she submit her annual disclosure statements for 2021 and 2022 within 30 days. The board was unable to take action for missing disclosures prior to 2021 due to the ordinance's statute of limitations.\n\n\nOn March 9, 2023, Owens was arraigned on a felony charge of false pretenses in 41B District Court. The Macomb County Prosecutor's Office alleged that she fraudulently applied for a COVID relief grant for her business and received $10,000 from the program. Owens is accused of fraudulently stating that her business was 51 percent or more owned by veterans and had 100–249 employees. The warrant authorization request stated that Owens “has never served at any capacity in any of the armed forces, and according to state unemployment records has zero employees other than herself\".\n\nOwens waived her right to a preliminary examination and on July 17 was bound over to the 16th Judicial Circuit Court for a July 31 arraignment.\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Owens pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of making a false statement. As part of the plea agreement, she was required to pay $10,000 in restitution to the victim. Sentencing was originally scheduled for October 10 but was delayed until November 9. In response to remarks made by Owens at sentencing, Judge Jennifer Faunce questioned the defendant's remorsefulness and suggested that she was grandstanding. Owens could have received a sentence of up to one year in jail but was ultimately sentenced to six months of probation, 100 hours of community service, and $725 in court costs.\n\n\nOwens faced three challengers in her 2023 bid for reelection. She was unseated in the primary as she failed to win a place among the top two vote getters. She received 14.1% percent of the vote. Mike Klinefelt and Mary Hall-Rayford, one of the plaintiffs in the civil rights lawsuit against Owens, proceeded to the general election.\n\nIn the general election, Klinefelt defeated Hall-Rayford. Klinefelt succeeded Owens as mayor on November 13, 2023.\n\nIn her final speech as mayor, Owens compared herself to Jesus and complained of being abandoned by people who had supported her.\n\n\nMonique Owens lives in Eastpointe and has two children.\n\nOwens is a Christian. She said in a 2021 city council meeting that she does not celebrate Christmas.\n\nIn 2022, Monique Owens authored a children's book titled ''Mom, What's a Mayor?''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

James reportedly met at the  with Trump,  , and  . He was ultimately bypassed for the position. Trump announced he would appoint , the  and a former television reporter, to succeed Haley, but Nauert was never nominated and announced in February 2019 that she was withdrawing from consideration.\n\nAfter Nauert's withdrawal, Trump again considered James for the ambassadorship, but eventually nominated   for the post.\n\n\n\n\nBecause the election margin in the 2018 Senate race was smaller than expected, James became a front-runner for the Republican nomination to take on Michigan's other incumbent Democratic senator, , in the .\n\nAs well as being recruited to take on Peters, it was reported in June 2019 that the  was recruiting James to challenge freshman Democratic U.S. representative  of .\n\nOn June 6, 2019, James announced that he was seeking the Republican nomination in  to take on Peters.

He raised $2 million after the election as he sought to challenge the election results, and he unsuccessfully attempted to block certification of the results of the election, which he lost to Peters by 1.7% of the vote, which was much closer than originally projected. James conceded on November 24 over social media, congratulating Peters.\n\nDuring his campaign, James pledged to give 5% of his campaign contributions to charity. The James fundraising committee reported about $46.12 million in total contributions for the 2020 election and has given more than $2.36 million to charities following through on his pledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames won the Republican primary in the 2022 election in .

She and her husband contributed more than $1.9 million of their own money to her 2002 and 2006 Secretary of State campaigns.\n\nThe ''Grand Rapids Press'' editorial board praised Land for her technological transformation of state services, including updates to computer systems; expansion of Web services; consolidation of branch offices and \"expanded hours in new, larger locations\"; and changes that for the first time allowed Michigan customers to pay fees with credit cards and renew license plate registrations through self-service stations. The ''Press'' editorial board wrote that, over the opposition of some Republicans, Land \"advocated measures that would expand participation at the polls, including , no-reason absentee voting and early registration for young voters.\"\n\nIn 2005, Land's office announced an effort to use the  to reduce potential voter fraud by removing names of voters who had died, moved out of Michigan, or changed their names. A '''' investigation found that 33,000 people were removed from the rolls, while Land's office said 11,000 voters were removed. The  (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the removal of voter names. The ''Times'' pointed out that similar problems were seen in other states, as \"Republican and Democratic election officials ... struggled to interpret new federal laws, such as the Help America Vote Act.\" In October 2008, a federal judge ruled that the national  had been violated and six states, including Michigan, were ordered to stop removing names from voter rolls. A spokesperson for Land's office told the ''Detroit Free Press'', \"If you're eligible to vote, you will be able to cast a vote on Election Day\".\n\nIn , Land was reelected, defeating  Clerk , 56%-42%.

Her campaign said that it had mistakenly failed to disclose a joint account she had with her husband. A '''' review of financial disclosure forms showed Land and her husband had assets worth $35 million in 2014, with $1.5 million belonging to Land, and that \"candidates may typically tap liberally into joint accounts with their spouses.\"\n\nIn May 2014, Land gave a speech at the Mackinac Policy Conference, a three-day event that many of the state's top business and civic leaders attend, which she read from notes. Following her speech, Land was swarmed by reporters and, unable to articulate a response to a question, pushed their microphones away, saying, \"I can't do this.\"\n\nLand was endorsed by the entire Michigan Republican delegation, as well as former congressman , and the .\n\nHer campaign was weighed down by various missteps and her reluctance to make public campaign appearances, particularly after the event in May. Peters opened up a consistent lead in the polls beginning in September. The Republican establishment effectively gave up on Land's campaign the following month. In the November 4 general election, Land received 41.3% of the vote to Peters's 54.6%.\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, Land filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State  for allowing votes postmarked before Election Day to be counted after Election Day.\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, the Michigan Republican Party was required by law to withdraw its nomination of Diane Dunaskiss for the  Board of Governors due to Dunaskiss's failure to pay a 2018 campaign fee. In an emergency state committee session, Land replaced Dunaskiss as the party's nominee.

She was formerly the City Manager, Director of Community & Economic Development, and Director of Community and Governmental Affairs for the city of  (2013). Prior to that, she was Executive Director of Government Affairs at  Michigan from 2011-2013. From 2005-2010, she served as  State Representative in the , representing the  which covers parts of  and . During her final term ending in 2010, she served as the Majority Floor Leader of the .\n\n\n\nAngerer grew up in , and is a lifelong Monroe County resident. She graduated from St. Mary's Academy in Monroe; attended . and is a graduate of Eastern Michigan University. She has five adult children. Prior to serving as State Representative, Angerer was the Communications Director for the Dundee Community Schools, where she successfully worked with a coalition of parents, teachers, and administrators to pass a millage expanding the size of Dundee High School.\n\nAs a legislator, Representative Angerer was noted to author legislation brought to her by residents of her district. Two such examples include her legislation to fix problems with railroad crossing inspections and to expand the Michigan Promise Grant program. She also authored legislation creating a statewide Patient Safety Organization to which all state hospitals must report adverse effects for the purpose of learning from mistakes and improving patient safety. One of her biggest priorities as a State Representative was legislation requiring insurance companies to cover treatment for children with , which while unsuccessful while she was in office, she continued to be a strong leading advocate towards final passage in 2012.\n\nFor the 95th Session of the Legislature in 2009, Angerer was elected by her colleagues to be the Majority Floor Leader. She had served as the Assistant Floor leader during the previous sessions.\n\nEarly in her service, Angerer was named Legislator of the Year by the Michigan Pharmacists' Association, the Hemophilia Foundation of Michigan, the Michigan Agri-Business Association. She was named as a Public Policy Health Champion in 2008 by the Michigan Department of Community Health.  The Southwest Lake Erie Chapter of Waterfowl U.S.A. named her as Outstanding Sportsperson of the Year for 2009. In 2010, she was named Legislator of the Year by both the Michigan Association of Chiropractors and the Michigan Distributors and Vendors Association.\n\n\nAngerer was elected to the State House in 2004, beating incumbent  . The race was one of the most expensive in Michigan in 2004, with over $500,000 spent between the two candidates and parties. Pundits credited Angerer's win with a strong door-to-door campaign which began in March of that year. Milosch was criticized for making statements against the .\n\n\nAngerer was the lone  running for State Representative in the district. She once again faced Republican Matt Milosh in the general election, and she was reelected. Again, Angerer's win was attributed to aggressive campaigning. She had also developed a strong reputation for delivering good service to her constituents as she visited more than 11,000 resident's homes during the campaign \"off-season\" to become aware of their concerns and help them with any state government-related issues. Angerer bested Milosch in the general election, outspending him nearly three-to-one.\n\n\nAgain, Angerer was unchallenged in the Democratic primary. She beat Republican challenger  in the November election. Moynihan was the surprise winner of the Republican primary, who ran a rather unconventional campaign. He refused to speak directly to the media and maintained a spartan website. As such, this race was seen by pundits to be heavily one-sided and led to Angerer improving on her vote-totals for the third straight election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKathy was appointed as the Interim City Manager on July 11, 2017, in a meeting that involved much yelling and disagreement between council members. Her appointment was a point of contention on the Hamtramck Council. On August 7, 2018, in the primary election, a City Charter Amendment was adopted, changing the way the City Manager is appointed. Speculation as to whether this was written to specifically accommodate Angerer or whether it was written to open up the broader City Manager search was unsure.  Artists and residents handed out flyers encouraging voters to vote against the proposal, saying it would give the council too much power to waive eligibility requirements.\n\nOn August 28, 2018 at the regular Hamtramck City Council Meeting, a resolution was brought forth for \"Approval of Appointment of Kathleen Angerer as Hamtramck City Manager\" At 7:48pm, two council members, Andrew Perrotta and Andrea Karpinski, exited the meeting in protest, in order to break quorum. There was no action due to lack of quorum, and Kathy Angerer was not appointed as permanent City Manager.\n\nJust within the Open Meetings' Act Time Frame, public comment and the resolution to appoint Kathy Angerer were added to a Special Meeting Agenda for Friday evening August 31, 2018 at 7 p.m. This happened to be the evening of one of the largest annual festivals in Hamtramck, a holiday weekend, and during famed local \"Queen of Soul\" 's funeral,.\n\nAs summarized by the Metro Times: \"When the majority of the city council turns away from the fresh air and sunshine of public debate, concocts their plans in private, and then uses special meetings, narrowly controlled information, and lock-step voting to push an agenda, this is precisely the environment in which rumors not only flourish, they can’t be effectively quashed.\"\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, Kathy Angerer's employment contract was amended by Hamtramck City Council at a regularly scheduled meeting. The legislation proposed, Resolution 2019-110 Resolution to Amend Employment Agreement of Kathleen Angerer, was added to the agenda at the last minute. Changes to the contract include a $5,000 salary raise and severance pay equal to two years of salary (her previous contract included a severance of three months' salary). Councilmembers Karpinski and Perotta questioned why this item was added to the agenda with more than a year remaining in Kathy's previous contract. The resolution passed, with Aye votes from Councilmembers Almasmari, Miah, Musa, Al-Marsoumi, and Mayor Majewski and Nay votes from Councilmembers Perotta and Karpinski.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She ran for the 24th District, located in Northern St. Clair Shores. The 24th district, which leans Democratic, was being vacated by Democrat Peggy Kennard. Roberts defeated Republican Richard Doan by a large margin.  She served on the commission for two years before being elected to the State House of Representatives.\n\nIn January 2008, Roberts filed to run as a Democrat for the 24th State House District, which was being vacated by Republican , who was barred from running for re-election due to term limits.

In the general election, Roberts faced Republican Bryan Brandenburg, an unsuccessful candidate for Macomb County Commission and son of then-current Representative Jack Brandenburg.\n\nThe race for the 24th District was one of the most competitive in Michigan. The state Democratic Party alone invested over $220,000 in the race, an unusually high number for a state house race. The race featured a large amount of negative campaigning, including adds that raised questions about four incidents involving Brandenburg in which the police investigated but no charges were filed, including an assault accusation at a party. On election day, Roberts emerged narrowly victorious by just over 1,000 votes, or about 2%. President Obama carried the 24th District by a similarly narrow 51.5%-46.4% margin.\n\nRoberts took office on January 1, 2009.

We are paying the price in more hurricanes and tornadoes.\" She has, however, opposed regulation of greenhouse gases, enhanced fuel efficiency standards in California, and greenhouse gas emission reporting standards.\n\nStabenow voted for the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S.493). In March 2011, '''' accused her of joining \"the pro-polluter frenzy sweeping the U.S. Senate,\" saying that the legislation was: \"being used as a vehicle for senators who wish to prevent regulation of greenhouse pollution from oil refineries, coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, and other major emitters. Stabenow has added her amendment to three others intended to hamstring the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of carbon polluters.\"\n\nStabenow's proposed amendment to keep the EPA from regulating  for two years also drew criticism. The amendment would have given “coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and other industrial sources a two year exemption” from rules requiring them to report greenhouse gas emissions. She defended her position by calling her amendment: \"a common-sense approach that allows protections from carbon pollution, determined by scientists and public health experts, to continue being developed while providing businesses the support and incentives they need as they reduce pollution, generate new clean energy technologies and create jobs.\"\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and  (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Stabenow was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator  calling on the agency: \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\"\n\n\nIn 2010, Stabenow called for a total ban on drilling in the Great Lakes. Critics noted that \"a U.S. federal ban on all oil and natural gas  in the Great Lakes\" had already \"been in place since 2005\" and that Canada banned offshore oil drilling but had \"roughly 500 offshore gas wells in Lake Erie\" plus 23 \"slant wells\" that \"drill for oil on shore but extend under Lake Erie.\" In 2015, Stabenow and Gary Peters introduced the Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act \"to ban shipping of crude oil by vessel on the Great Lakes and require a comprehensive, top-to-bottom review of hazardous pipelines in the region.\"\n\nIn May 2017, Stabenow expressed support for the bipartisan effort to retain funding for The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.\n\nIn September 2016, Stabenow and Peters led an effort to link an aid package for the  to flood relief funds for .\n\n\nOn August 31, 2006, Stabenow, Senator  and Representative  announced an agreement that would completely cease 's dumping of solid waste in Michigan within four years.

In July 2006, the Senate unanimously passed a law sponsored by Stabenow requiring the payment of a $420 inspection fee for every truckload of Canadian trash brought into Michigan.\n\n\nAsked in 2009 by  whether she would support a return of the , under which the federal government enforced an ideological \"balance\" on the airwaves, Stabenow said yes: \"I absolutely think it's time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves.\" Asked whether she would push for Senate hearings on the subject, she said, \"I have already had some discussions with colleagues and, you know, I feel like that's gonna happen. Yep.\" It has been noted that Stabenow's then husband was , an executive in left-wing radio (, ), whose career would have benefited from such legislation.\n\nStabenow is probably the most prominent politician to seriously support a new Fairness Doctrine.\n\n\nStabenow, as  Chair, added an amendment to the  that prohibited state laws requiring  for foods. She has been criticized because this amendment aided  and other agribusinesses, which donated over three-quarters of a million dollars to her campaign during that election cycle. In 2016, she was again criticized for her role in the passage of a law that overruled state laws mandating GMO labeling.\n\n\nIn January 2017, Stabenow opposed Trump's nomination of  as : \"Because of his record on  and his votes against anti- legislation, I cannot support him to be our nation's highest law enforcement officer...Families in Michigan and across the country deserve an attorney general who will enforce the nation's laws fairly and equally.\"\n\nThat March, she opposed Trump's nomination of  to the : \"After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's rulings, it is clear that he has a long record of siding with special interests and institutions instead of hard-working Americans. And, therefore, in my judgment, he does not meet this standard of balance and impartiality.\"\n\nIn July 2018, citing his past rulings on presidential powers, she opposed , furthermore stating that the FBI should perform a background check regarding .\n\nShe similarly opposed Trump's 2020 , stating: \"It's very clear from her writings, multiple writings, that she will be the vote that takes away health care for millions of Americans, including 130 million people and counting with pre-existing conditions...\" She voted against the nomination while wearing a  depicting Barrett's predecessor .\n\n\nOn January 5, 2023, Stabenow announced her intention to retire from the Senate. Her announcement cited a desire to \"pass the torch\" to Michigan's next generation of leadership: \"I have always believed it's not enough to be the first unless there is a second and a third\". She also noted time with family as a motivation for her retirement. If she serves in the Senate until her term ends in January 2025, she will have held elective office for 50 years. In February 2023, Michigan Representative  launched a campaign to succeed Stabenow in the Senate.\n\n\nIn February 2023, a portrait of Stabenow by Michigan artist Joshua Adam Risner was unveiled in the .

They divorced in 2010.\n\nStabenow had a cameo appearance in the 2016 film '''' as governor of the unspecified state in which  is located.

In October 2013, the Speaker visited Detroit with state Representative , a Democrat from Michigan's 9th house district, and pledged to explore ways to fight crime, lower auto insurance rates and clean up the city. After the visit Speaker Bolger met with the  to discuss alternatives to fighting crime, as well as discussing plans about alternative sentencing options with other legislators.\n\nAlso, since that visit the Speaker has worked with local Detroit representatives to garner support for scrap metal theft legislation and education reform. Recently, the Speaker proposed a change to Michigan's auto insurance laws, which would help reduce cost for Detroit's drivers; after promoting his proposal the Speaker met with Representatives  and Santana in an effort to create bi-partisan reform.\n\n\nIn May 2014, Bolger announced the formation of a special committee, House Committee on Detroit's Recovery and Michigan's Future, to help Detroit settle the largest municipal  in history while protecting Michigan taxpayers statewide.Oosting, Jonathan, , mlive.com, May 13, 2014; accessed January 17, 2015. Bolger was quoted as saying \"we are putting a strong team in place to resolve this difficult issue today with a vision for a bright future.\" The committee introduced legislation to help Detroit avoid further bankruptcy litigation by offering a $194.8 million lump sum to the city's retirement systems. In addition to the one-time contribution, legislation was passed to create an oversight commission to aid Detroit's recovery.\n\nThe Speaker also called on unions to make contributions to help in the Detroit settlement.Egan, Paul & John Gallagher, , freep.com, April 18, 2014; accessed January 17, 2015. Bolger requested unions to make a material contribution that is reflective of other parties involved in the settlement. Bolger's request did not come without opposition, the '''' issued an editorial claiming Governor  should convince Speaker Bolger to drop his demand or go around Bolger. The '''' editorialized that the union contribution demand was too much, and the likelihood of unions contributing would be slim. Other critics wrote that Bolger's demand would imperil the settlement. Bolger did receive support from conservative columnists and was urged to continue his demand. Bolger held firm to his request, and unions - the first was The Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council - did agree to make material contributions towards health care costs to help with the Detroit bankruptcy settlement.Oosting, Jonathan (May 19, 2014) , mlive.com; accessed March 3, 2015.

Upon passage, the ''Detroit News'' called the final legislative package a \"grand piece of work\", and the '''' opined that the deal showed that lawmakers \"get it\".\n\n\n\nOn June 13, 2012, Speaker Bolger allegedly refused to recognize now former Michigan state legislator  for a full service day after she used the term \"vagina\" during a floor debate over a bill (HB 5711) to further regulate abortion in the state.Peralta, Eyder (June 14, 2012). , npr.org; accessed December 20, 2014. Initially, Brown claimed she was denied the opportunity to speak due to religious discrimination, and then later claimed she was silenced for saying \"vagina.\"\n\nA spokesman for Bolger said that Brown was not allowed to give her opinion on a school employee retirement bill because when Brown said \"Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all are so interested in my vagina, but no means no\", she had violated the rules of the House and had \"failed to maintain the decorum of the House.\"\n\n\nIn 2012, Bolger worked with then-Democratic Michigan state Rep.  to switch parties at the filing deadline.Reens, Nate (May 15, 2012).  ''Grand Rapids Press''. Schmidt expressed dissatisfaction with what he called extreme party bosses in the Democratic party. Schmidt recruited a replacement for Democrats, 22-year-old Matt Mojzak, who did not mount a campaign, thus effectively leaving the Democrats without a viable candidate. With no serious Democratic candidate, Schmidt effectively ensured his victory as a Republican.Abbey-Lambertz, Kate (July 19, 2012). , HuffingtonPost.com; accessed December 20, 2014. Schmidt reportedly offered to pay Mojzak $450 to file as the Democratic challenger. Schmidt later upped the amount to $1,000 when Mojzak announced he was going to withdraw his candidacy.\n\nBolger exchanged text messages with Schmidt, which indicated he was involved in the Mojzak affair.Reens, Nate (July 18, 2012).

He did his graduate work at  in London and , which was said to be formative for his judicial philosophy. He developed a need to decide cases based on his more holistic notions of justice, eschewing technical legal arguments. As one commentator quipped of his later Supreme Court service, he \"tempered justice with Murphy.\"\n\n\n\nMurphy was appointed and took the oath of office as the first  for the  on August 9, 1919. He was one of three assistant attorneys in the office.\n\nWhen Murphy began his career as a federal attorney, the workload of the attorney's office was increasing at a rapid rate, mainly because of the number of prosecutions resulting from the enforcement of . The government's excellent record in winning convictions in the Eastern District was partially due to Murphy's record of winning all but one of the cases he prosecuted. He practiced law privately to a limited extent while still a federal attorney, and resigned his position as a  on March 1, 1922. He had several offers to join private practices, but decided to go it alone and formed a partnership with Edward G.

In 1923, he was elected judge of the Recorder's Court on a non-partisan ticket by one of the largest majorities ever cast for a judge in Detroit, took office on January 1, 1924, and served seven years during the .\n\nWhile on Recorder's Court, he established a reputation as a trial judge. He was a presiding judge in the famous murder trials of Dr.  and his brother, Henry Sweet, in 1925 and 1926. , then one of the most prominent trial  in the country, was lead counsel for the defense.

In 1933, Murphy convened in Detroit and organized the first convention of the . They met and conferred with  , and Murphy was elected its first president. He served in that position from 1932 until 1933.\n\nMurphy was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Roosevelt and the , helping Roosevelt to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state of Michigan since   before the Republican Party was founded.\n\nA 1993 survey of historians, political scientists, and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the  saw Murphy ranked as the seventh-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. Holli wrote that Murphy was an exemplary mayor and a highly effective leader.\n\n\nBy 1933, after Murphy's second mayoral term, the reward of a big government job was waiting.

The  was a turning point in national  and labor policy. After 27 people were injured in a battle between the workers and the police, including 13 strikers with gunshot wounds, Murphy sent the  to protect the workers, failed to follow a court order that requested him to expel the strikers, and refused to order the Guard's troops to suppress the strike.\n\nHe successfully mediated an agreement and end to the confrontation, and G.M. recognized the  as a bargaining agent under the newly adopted . This recognition had a significant effect on the growth of organized labor unions. In the next year, the UAW saw its membership grow from 30,000 to 500,000 members. As later noted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), this strike was \"the strike heard round the world.\"\n\nIn 1938, Murphy was defeated by his predecessor, Fitzgerald, who became the only governor of Michigan to precede, and then succeed, the same person.\n\n\nIn 1939, Roosevelt appointed Murphy the 56th .

He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 16, and sworn in on February 5, 1940. The timing of the appointment put Murphy on the cusp of the  and the  courts. On the death of  Stone, Murphy served in the court led by , who was confirmed in 1946. During  he served in the  during three months of 1942 while the court was in recess. He served as the executive officer to the  . He retired with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nMurphy took an expansive view of individual liberties, and the limitations on government he found in the . He authored 199 opinions: 131 for the majority, 68 in dissent. One of the important opinions authored by Justice Murphy was '''' (1946), in which the Court defined the term \"investment contract\" under the , thus giving content to the most important concept of what makes something a security in American law.\n\nOpinions differ about him and his  philosophy. He has been acclaimed as a legal scholar and a champion of the common man, but Justice  disparagingly nicknamed Murphy \"the Saint\", criticizing his decisions as being rooted more in passion than reason. It has been said he was \"neither legal scholar nor craftsman\", and he was criticized \"for relying on heart over head, results over legal reasoning, clerks over hard work, and emotional solos over team play.\"\n\n\nMurphy's support of African Americans, aliens, criminals, dissenters, , , women, workers and other \"outsiders\" evoked a pun: \"tempering justice with Murphy.\" As he wrote in '''' (1944), \"The law knows no finer hour than when it cuts through formal concepts and transitory emotions to protect unpopular citizens against discrimination and persecution.\" (p.&nbsp;561)\n\nAccording to Frankfurter, Murphy was part of the more liberal \"axis\" of justices on the Court along with justices , , and ; the group would for years oppose Frankfurter's \"judicially restrained\" conservative ideology. Douglas, Murphy and then Rutledge were the first justices to agree with Black's notion that the  incorporated the Bill of Rights' protection in it; this view would later become law.\n\nMurphy is perhaps best known for his vehement dissent from the court's ruling in '''' (1944), which upheld the constitutionality of the government's  during World War II. He sharply criticized the majority ruling as \"legalization of racism.\"\n\nThis was the first time the word \"racism\" found its way into a Supreme Court opinion (Murphy had previously used the term twice in a concurring opinion in '''' (1944) issued that same day). He would use that word again in five separate opinions before the word \"racism\" disappeared from Murphy's and the High Court's other opinions for almost two decades, not reappearing until the landmark decision of '''' (1967), which struck down as unconstitutional the Virginia  statute. (See also .)\n\nAlthough Murphy was serving on the Supreme Court during World War II, he still longed to be part of the war effort and so he served at  as an infantry officer during court recesses.\n\nOn January 30, 1944, almost exactly one year before  liberation of the  on January 27, 1945, Justice Murphy unveiled the formation of the National Committee Against Nazi Persecution and Extermination of the Jews. Serving as committee chair, he declared that it was created to combat  \"breeding the germs of hatred against Jews.\" This announcement was made on the 11th anniversary of 's appointment as  of Germany. The eleven committee members included U.S. Vice President , 1940  presidential candidate  and ,  of the Protestant .\n\nMurphy was among 12 nominated at the  to serve as Roosevelt's running mate in the . He acted as chairman of the National Committee against  Persecution and Extermination of the Jews and of the Philippine War Relief Committee.

He was the subject of \"[r]umors of homosexuality [...] all his adult life\". According to ''Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v. The Supreme Court'':\n[a] gay reading of [biographies of Murphy] suggests that Murphy's homosexuality was hiding in plain sight. For more than 40 years, Edward G. Kemp was Frank Murphy's devoted, trusted companion. Like Murphy, Kemp was a lifelong bachelor. From college until Murphy's death, the pair found creative ways to work and live together. [...] When Murphy appeared to have the better future in politics, Kemp stepped into a supportive, secondary role, much as Hillary Clinton would later do for Bill Clinton.\n\nAs well as Murphy's close relationship with Kemp, Murphy's biographer, historian , found in Murphy's personal papers a letter that \"if the words mean what they say, refers to a homosexual encounter some years earlier between Murphy and the writer.\" The writer of the letter implied that he and Murphy had become lovers while Murphy was governor-general and congratulated Murphy on his appointment to the Supreme Court.\n\nMurphy did have at least two female companions of note. Ann Parker was frequently seen horseback riding with Murphy in Washington during his tenure as U.S. Attorney General, leading to speculation of a romance in the press.

He later served as president of the , becoming the first  president of the organization, which, until 1943, had barred  from membership.\n\n\nDennis Archer was born on January 1, 1942, to a working-class family living on the east side of Detroit.  His family struggled financially because Archer's father lost his arm in an automobile accident. There were few employment opportunities for disabled people in the city, so the family relocated to rural Cassopolis when Archer was five years old.\n\nArcher began working to help provide for his family at just eight years old. He worked as a golf-caddy, pinsetter at a bowling alley, and janitor at a bakery. After graduating high school, Archer financed his college education by painting homes, working at a drug store and becoming the first African-American to work in the Henry Ford Hospital medical records department. Archer began his college education at  with the intention of becoming a pharmacist. He later transferred to the  and then to Western Michigan University.\n\nAt Western Michigan University, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in education. He initially had planned to be a history teacher but later transferred to being a special education teacher at Ralph Bunche Elementary School, located just east of downtown Detroit. From 1965 to 1970, Archer taught disabled children in Detroit Public Schools. He then went on to earn his J.D. from the Detroit College of Law, now the College of Law of Michigan State University, in 1970.\n\nIn addition to practicing law in Detroit, Archer was an associate professor at the Detroit College of Law from 1972 to 1978, and an adjunct professor at  from 1984 to 1985. He was a member of the board of directors of the Detroit Bar Association and chairman of the association's Young Lawyers Section from 1973 to 1975. Archer was also president of three bar associations: The Wolverine Bar Association from 1979 to 1980, the National Bar Association from 1983 to 1984, and the State Bar of Michigan from 1984 to 1985.\n\n\nAfter a very successful 15-year career as a lawyer, Archer was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court by Governor James Blanchard.  He was only the second black man to sit on that court in Michigan's history, ending a nearly twenty-year period without African American presence. Archer served as a justice from 1986 to 1990. During his last year on Michigan Supreme Court, he was named \"most respected judge in Michigan\" by ''''.\n\n\nArcher began his campaign for mayor in 1990, running against the very liked Mayor Coleman Young, seeking reelection to serve his sixth term in office. When Mayor Young dropped out of the race due to illness, he gave his endorsement to Sharon McPhail.\n\nArcher ran on a platform of bridging the gap between the suburban and urban populations of Detroit. He also ran on a plank against casinos, a position that put him in line with most city voters and many of the religious leaders in the city. This created distrust among some in the African-American community who feared that Archer would prioritize the needs of whites over their own. Many thought that Archer “was not black enough to be mayor of a city that was about 80 percent African American”.  Archer worked to end this perception by explaining who he represents.  “I stand before you representing the children who are more concerned about surviving the school day... the homeless, the disenfranchised and the working poor who want affordable housing, and a clean and decent place to live”. He emphasized that he was interested in improving life for all city and suburban dwellers, whether they be black, white, Arabic, Jewish, or Hispanic. One of the chief campaign strategists for Archer was .\n\nIn November 1993, Archer won the election over McPhail, with votes divided 57 to 43 percent respectively.  According to exit polls Archer won 90 percent of the white vote but only 47 percent of the black vote.\n\nArcher served as mayor of Detroit from 1993 to 2001. During his tenure, he worked to repair the city's relations with the Detroit suburbs and the local business community through cooperation with suburban business leaders on their redevelopment plans for the city. One of his major economic contributions to Detroit was attracting the tech giant  to the city. During his tenure the city saw its bond rating upgraded multiple times. When he became mayor the city was still tracking most complex financial processes on file cards. Archer introduced computerization to most city departments. His administration also initiated a work force development program.\n\nIn his first term as mayor, Detroit was selected to house an  and received other federal benefits which cumulatively brought $100 million to the city. Unemployment also decreased in the city.\n\nArcher was a strong supporter of numerous construction projects in downtown Detroit, including two new stadiums, Ford Field for the Detroit Lions and  for the Detroit Tigers. Archer also became president of the National League of Cities during his last year as mayor.\n\nDespite the decrease in crime and unemployment during Archer's time as mayor, he was frequently criticized for allegedly not supporting or listening to leaders of the African-American community.  He faced strong opposition when opening three casinos within city limits and not granting any of the three casino licenses to an African American.\n\nArcher was re-elected by a large margin  but was subject to a recall campaign in his second term, launched by many of his original opponents. He declined to run for reelection .\n\n\nUpon leaving office as mayor in January 2002, Archer was appointed as chairman of Detroit-based  , and the board of directors of .\nHe is a Fellow of the Litigation Counsel of America.\n\nIn 2004, he was appointed to an eight-year term ending December 31, 2012 on the  of the  by  .

His father, Mitch Irwin, was a state senator from that area from 1979-1990. His mother, Cynthia Williams, was a labor lawyer and CEO of MESSA.  He graduated from East Lansing High School in 1995. After graduating from high school, he moved to  in 1995 to attend college at the . He graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science. Irwin lives in  and currently lives in Ward 3 with his wife, Kathryn, and their two children, Sylvia and Mackinac.\n\nPrior to becoming an elected official, Irwin worked as a legislative aide to then State Senator . He also worked for the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, organizing programs for local environmental and conservation organizations. After several years working at LCVEF, Irwin served as Executive Director for the , advocating for clean air and clean water policies and holding elected officials accountable for their voting records in the state legislature.\n\n\n\n\nElected as a Washtenaw County Commissioner at age 22 in 1999, Irwin served for 11 years in Washtenaw County Government. On the commission, he was instrumental in building a new homeless shelter, increasing funding for human services and affordable housing, instituting a living wage policy, and helping to create the Washtenaw Health Plan, which extended health insurance to uninsured workers prior to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor his work, the Michigan Jaycees, a group providing development opportunities that empower young people to create positive change, named him “Best Young Government Leader of the Year” in 2000.\n\n\nAfter 6 terms on the County Commission, Irwin ran for Michigan’s 53rd House District in 2010. He was sworn in as a State Representative in 2011 and won 3 successive terms before being prohibited from running again due to term limits. As a State Representative, Irwin primarily focused on securing additional education funding for Michigan’s students, increasing healthcare coverage, criminal justice reform, and introducing legislation to protect the environment and natural resources. Irwin helped pass Medicaid expansion, extending Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of Michiganders. He led opposition against fracking and in favor of clean energy, and introduced the first legislation to shut down Enbridge’s “Line 5”, a pipeline that runs through the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan. Irwin also led the introduction of cannabis legalization and asset forfeiture reform.\n\nIn 2012, Irwin and five of his House Democratic colleagues filed a suit against the, at the time, Michigan House Republican Speaker Jase Bolger, Floor Leader Jim Stamas and Speaker Pro Tem John Walsh. This suit was in response to the passage of controversial legislation affecting graduate research assistants and the collection of union dues by public employers, and changes to the rules about petition signatures and ballot initiatives. The suit alleged that Republicans were violating the Michigan State Constitution by not granting requests for recorded roll call votes on whether legislation should take immediate effect.\n\nThe Ingham Circuit Court initially ruled in favor of Irwin and his colleagues granting an injunction against the legislation in question. This ruling was appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals which overturned the lower court’s ruling.\n\nIn 2013, Irwin introduced a bill that would fully decriminalize marijuana,\n and sponsored legislation to legalize , recognize same-sex marriages that were licensed in other states, and reverse the state's ban on extending health benefits to domestic partners of public employees. Since introducing legislation on these topics in 2013, Michigan has legalized adult use of cannabis, dramatically reformed civil asset forfeiture, and begun the process to shutdown Line 5.\n\nIrwin was ranked as the most liberal legislator in the Michigan House in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Irwin spearheaded reducing the  (DEQ) threshold for 1,4 dioxane from 85ppm to 7.2ppm, following the discovery of a family affected by numerous health conditions, found drinking and living with well water with high levels of dioxane. He also organized a DEQ Townhall on dioxane in Ann Arbor, bringing together experts like Roger Rayle, who had been tracking the spread of dioxane in the area for decades, precipitating the EPA SuperFund application by Washtenaw County.\n\nIn 2016, Irwin's budget amendment restoring $3.2 million in funding for the “Heat and Eat” program, which leverages federal heating assistance funds (LIHEAP) to qualify food assistance recipients for increased benefits from  (SNAP). This funding helps 160,000 low-income families receive an average of $76 more a month for food benefits .\n\n\nIn October 2017, Irwin announced his candidacy for the Michigan Senate in the 18th District. Other candidates in the Democratic primary were Michelle Deatrick, Anjua Rajendra, and Matt Miller. On August 8, Irwin became the Democratic nominee for state senate in the 18th District.\n\nOn November 7, Irwin defeated Martin Church, the Republican Senate nominee, in the general election by 70,271 votes.\n\nAs a State Senator, Irwin serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary and Public Safety and Oversight Committees, as well as the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules. In the Appropriations Committee, he serves as minority Vice-Chair of the Universities and Community Colleges subcommittee and on the Health and Human Services and General Government subcommittees.\n\nIn the Senate, Irwin has introduced legislation to tighten regulations against polluters, allow more juvenile offenders to seal their records, expunge all cannabis-related offenses, ban PFAS in food packaging and dramatically expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. He was also instrumental in securing statewide funding that increased direct care workers’ wages by $2.35.\n\nDuring the 2019-2020 legislative session, five of Irwin’s bills were signed into law. Irwin’s legislation allowing juveniles to expunge traffic offenses and have certain offenses automatically expunged, and limiting the use of bench warrants for first-time failures to appear in court were both signed into law in 2021. So far, during the 2021-2022 legislative session, one of Irwin's bills has been signed into law. Irwin's legislation resolves a major issue that prevented legal Michigan residents from collecting . This issue also caused the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) to charge Michigan residents, who had lawfully collected federal pandemic unemployment assistance, with fraud.\n\nIn 2022, due to redistricting, Irwin was elected to the state senate's .\n\n\n\n\nIrwin has been an outspoken critic of public officials accepting and using corporate campaign donations. He strongly supports limiting the amount individuals can give to a political campaign and banning corporate political donations. In the House, Irwin introduced legislation to eliminate \"\" schemes by limiting the awarding of state contracts to campaign donors.\n\nFollowing a 2016 investigative report which showed that Michigan lawmakers were evading campaign finance law prohibiting the contribution of corporate funds to individual candidates through a loophole allowing the establishment of a non-profit 527 administrative account that can accept corporate donations, Irwin described these accounts as “undisclosed slush funds”, further saying that candidates “are not allowed to take corporate checks” and even though there is a loophole that “doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do.”\n\nThe report had a large corporation that received a state tax-break had donated to a 527 administrative account belonging to the at-the-time Michigan Senate Majority Leader, Arlan Meekhof.\n\n\nAs a member of the Michigan Senate, Irwin has introduced legislation that would remove pharmaceutical companies' lawsuit immunity by amending the Michigan Product Liability Act of 1995, saying that the Michigan \"legislature took away our right to sue drug manufacturers when their product hurts or kills\" consumers. The Michigan Product Liability Act of 1995 is recognized as the strictest product liability law as it grants pharmaceutical companies near absolute immunity from lawsuits. This law prevents residents of Michigan and the Michigan Attorney General from pursuing lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, like  and , for their role in the . In 2011, the Michigan Court of Appeals dismissed a lawsuit filed against  by former-Attorney General  over the arthritis pain medication Vioxx.  caused heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\nIn 2015, Irwin introduced legislation to prohibit civil asset forfeiture in Michigan unless a person is convicted of a crime. Since then, this reform has been made in Michigan law, and further reform has gained widespread support in Michigan.\n\nIn 2020, Irwin introduced legislation that would require all police officers, new and current, to receive training on implicit bias and violence de-escalation techniques, as well as take a mental health screening, as a part of their initial training and certification. It passed the Michigan Senate unanimously, but did not pass the Michigan House.\n\nIn 2014 and 2021, Irwin introduced legislation that would require parental consent before a child could be used by police as an informant\n\nIn 2021, his legislation that greatly expanded expungement for juveniles and automatically expunged certain non-violent offenses committed by juveniles was signed into law by Governor .\n\nIn 2022, Irwin led a bipartisan group of state senators to introduce legislation that would abolish juvenile life without parole in Michigan saying \"Michigan law needs to recognize that juvenile offenders deserve a chance at rehabilitation\".  If passed this legislation would bring Michigan into alignment with the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in '''', which held that sentencing juveniles to mandatory life without the possibility of parole is unconstitutional.\n\n\nIrwin believes that providing quality, free public education should be the most important priority of Michigan’s government. While serving on the Washtenaw County Board, he helped expand early childhood education. This expansion included the creation of the Eastern Washtenaw Head Start program.\n\nIn 2021, Irwin introduced legislation that would impact literacy performance in children, specifically pertaining to screening and treating aspects of dyslexia. The legislation would help identify students who are exhibiting problems with learning language and reading skills, and provide schools and educators with the necessary intervention and tiered support they need to help these students succeed. Irwin also introduced legislation that would prevent and reduce students being removed from school, while ensuring that their due process rights are protected during disciplinary actions.\n\n\nIrwin introduced legislation that would prohibit gas utilities from charging Michigan residents for natural gas that was lost and unaccounted for (LAUF). LAUF gas can occur because of pipeline leaks, variations in temperature and meter reading timings, third-party damage, meter tampering, and/or when repairs and replacements are done to natural gas pipelines. Under Michigan law, natural gas utilities can recover the costs of LAUF gas by including it in consumers' monthly energy bills.\n\nIn the Michigan House, he and a bipartisan group of House members introduced \"Energy Freedom\" legislation that would have created policies for , fair pricing, community-owned energy gardens, and energy grid improvements. This legislation would have also streamlined the process by which individuals, businesses, farmers or places of worship could offset energy costs by generating their own energy. It would have also ensured that energy producers received a fair and competitive price.\n\n\nIrwin was an early and has been an outspoken advocate for the shutdown of Enbridge’s Line 5 that runs through the Straits of Mackinac.  After Governor Gretchen Whitmer moved to shut down Line 5, Irwin thanked her for “taking bold, decisive” and that for “the last 67 years, Enbridge has continually prioritized profits over people, and put our state at risk of a catastrophic oil spill in the Great Lakes that could devastate our economy and way of life.”\n\nHe has sponsored legislation to remove Michigan’s cap on residential solar production and require polluters to be held accountable for the cleanup costs of their pollution.\n\n\nIrwin believes that everyone deserves access to medical care when they need it. [23] He is a supporter of Medicare for All.\n\nIn the Michigan House, Irwin supported the expansion of the Healthy Kids Dental program that now provides dental coverage to all Medicaid-eligible children under age 21 in Michigan, and he was instrumental in the statewide Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn 2019, Irwin introduced legislation aimed at reducing violence against nurses and healthcare workers.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Irwin successfully led efforts to increase direct care workers' wages by $2.35.\n\n\nIrwin supports policies that protect workers and wages, including paid time off, one fair wage, expanded parental leave, anti-discrimination in the workplace bills and pay equity. He has also worked against payroll fraud and the employer practice of misclassifying employees as independent contracts.\n\nIn 2012, Irwin voted against the legislation that made Michigan a “Right-to-Work” state saying that “the states that have the most dynamic, successful economies are states that respect their workers and that invest in education.”\n\nIrwin supports repealing laws that weaken protections in the Tenure Act that ensure job and retirement security for educators. He opposes requiring schools to bid out and attempt to privatize services in the schools, efforts that increase costs and decreases the quality of the services in the long-term.\n\n\nIrwin has been a longtime supporter of LGBTQ+ rights in Michigan. In 2000, Jeff Irwin was instrumental in expanding benefits for Washtenaw County employees to cover domestic partners. He supported marriage equality prior to the  decision and introduced legislation to make second-parent adoption available to same-sex partners in Michigan.\n\nIrwin has supported numerous legislative attempts to expand the housing and employment protections in the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. In a 2018 interview, Irwin said that “it should be illegal to fire somebody or to deny them housing because of their gender expression or sexual orientation”.\n\nIn 2014, Irwin publicly supported Washtenaw County Clerk, , against then-Attorney General Bill Schuette’s legal defense of Michigan’s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the Michigan Senate, Irwin continues to sponsor legislation that would expand adoption rights to all LGBT couples in Michigan and is a co-sponsor of current efforts to expand laws preventing discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations.\n\n\nIrwin is a strong supporter of  and protecting access to abortion. He has been endorsed by multiple feminist and reproductive rights groups during his time in office. In his 2010 State House primary, Irwin was endorsed by Michigan National Organization for Women. He has also been endorsed by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2018.\n\n\nIrwin has been a longtime supporter of expanding access to the right to vote and improving the system for voters. In the Michigan House, he introduced legislation to allow absentee voting for any reason and opposed efforts to institute strict voter ID laws that would have disenfranchised many elderly and poor voters.\n\nIn the Michigan Senate, he is on the Senate Oversight Committee which took testimony from individuals who falsely claimed that there was fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election. The Republican-led committee released a report showing that there was no fraud during or after the election, Irwin said he was glad that Republicans “are finally and definitely putting an end to ‘The Big Lie’ perpetuated by the former president.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She is the first woman to hold that role, as well as the youngest mayor in 130 years.\n\nBliss’s first words as mayor were in regards to George Hartwell, the previous mayor of Grand Rapids. She expressed her gratitude by saying, “I am standing on the shoulders of many great leaders who came before me.” During Bliss’s first term as mayor, she was joined on the commission by newcomers Jon O’Connor and David Allen who were both former school board members. As well as Ruth Kelly who was re-elected and library commissioners Rachel Anderson, James Botts and Sophia Brewer. |date=2015-12-18 |title=Rosalynn Bliss becomes Grand Rapids mayor |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2015/12/rosalynn_bliss_becomes_grand_r.html |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=mlive |language=en}}\n\nDuring her inaugural State of the City speech, Bliss expressed her entire to-do list. This consisted of, “Foster racial equity, Provide more affordable housing. Enliven neighborhoods, Strengthen schools. Restore the Grand River’s rapids. Solve homelessness. Grow the local economy.”\n\n\nAnother major action Bliss took in her first term as mayor was she was able to work with city workers to begin getting them implicit bias training. Bliss strongly believed this was important as she states, “We must confront a difficult issue that has grown to an unacceptable proportion in our city…It starts with how the city government looks and how we think. We learn to honestly assess our own biases, and know how those biases impact others, specifically in how they result in denying opportunities for others.”\n\n\nDuring her first term as mayor, Bliss also chose to prioritize bettering police–community relations. She refers to the police force as the “canopy that covers our neighborhoods” and highly emphasizes the fact that a community and a police force would be stronger working together.\n\n\nBliss got fellow commissioners on board to create a fund that can be donated to local neighborhoods in order to fund projects. “This would create an innovative, creative way to empower people to come together to work on projects”.\n\n\nAt the beginning of Bliss’s mayoral term, she also urged colleagues to pass an ordinance in order to hold property owners accountable for blighted vacant properties. Bliss strongly believes that these vacant properties contribute to the lack of success in a neighborhood. “We can’t allow these properties to drag down neighborhoods like a diseased tree branch that, if left untrimmed, the disease spreads.”\n\n\nBliss also created a general plan for the Grand Rapids movement towards sustainability. Some goals were to provide a city park within walking distance of all the citizens, completely make the change to renewable energy throughout the entire city by 2025, increase recycling habits, increase the tree canopy to 40% throughout the city, and pave over 100 miles of bike lanes to stray away from the use of motor vehicles.\n\n\nMayor Bliss hopes to be able to restore the aesthetic and accessibility of the Grand River in the City of Grand Rapids. “Imagine being at Riverside Park and seeing rowing on the river, canoeing or kayaking through the city, and the eventual capacity to ride your bike on a 10-mile urban trail all along the river from Riverside Park to Millenium Park and beyond.” Like all other of the policies that Bliss will be focusing on, she really is hoping to bring the Grand Rapids community closer. She then went on to say, “These are realistic dreams. The groundwork has already started to restore our namesake – Grand Rapids.”\n\n\nShe won reelection on November 5, 2019. She defeated Daniel Schutte with over 83% of the vote. Bliss received 23,717 votes compared to Schutte, who only received 4,476 votes. For Bliss’s second mayoral run, her campaign fund totaled to $87,200 going into election week.\n\nOn the ballot for Bliss’s second election, voters also had the opportunity to vote for permanent parks millage which would ultimately create a fund for the city's public parks and pools.\n\nAs mayor, Bliss joined 130 US mayors launching a ten-minute walk to a park campaign. She was appointed by Governor Snyder to serve on the Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board. She has been a proponent of  with the city, twice receiving gold certification from the Michigan Green Communities Network in the Michigan Green Communities Challenge for their work in approving a bicycle action plan, zero cities project, having a strategic plan with sustainability as a core value and converting the city's yard waste site to a composting facility. Bliss actively participated in the Living Cities Racial Equity Here initiative resulting in policy and budget process changes to incorporate a racial equity toolkit.\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Bliss made sure to keep in touch with her community. In her letter she states safety precautions that could be taken in order to protect those who could be highly affected by the pandemic. She also went on to express the fact that there were many services being offered throughout the city of Grand Rapids. She also urged citizens to stay informed on the latest updates and initial steps towards combatting the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She said that after she rejected his advances, he \"said he had insider information on the case. I don't know if he meant it to be threatening, but I took it that way.\"\n\nAt a time when the  was pushing for action against men who harassed women, some media and supporters in Detroit believed Conyers had been unfairly treated.

With Horrigan's retirement from the council, the 6th Ward was left without an  councilman. Neeley won the 6th Ward’s August 2 primary election, allowing him to move on to the , where he faced challenger Nancy DeKatch.

In the November 5th general election, Neeley won 7,082 votes to Weaver’s 6,877, and Neeley was elected as Flint's mayor.\n\nOn February 2, 2022, the ''Flint Journal'' published an article stating that Neeley had disclosed his intention to run for re-election as Flint's mayor to the paper on January 31.

Neeley's re-election campaign spending reached a total of $166,000.\n\n\n\n\nGiven Flint's strong mayoral powers, the mayor has the ability to appoint government officials, including police and fire chiefs. In November 2019 when Neeley was elected, he appointed Phil Hart as the interim police chief, who was standing in while Neeley found the right officer to fill the important position permanently. In Hart's time as police chief, he had the job of addressing Flint's rising gun violence in a way that would set up for the incoming permanent police chief. Neeley and Hart worked together to end the gun buyback program, recruiting new officers, and increasing neighborhood patrol. In September 2020, Terrance Green took over as the permanent Flint police chief. He previously served in the neighboring town of Mt. Morris as police chief, as well as commander for the drug unit of Genesee County.\n\n\nCompared to 2019 when Neeley took office, there was a 30% increase in homicides, ranking Flint the tenth highest city for violent crimes in 2020. In the light of rising homicides and shootings, Neeley asked for emergency state and federal assistance initially in July 2021, but pushed to extend the emergency help indefinitely to try to curb the street violence. Through several executive orders, the Flint Police Department partnered with community mental health professionals to offer trauma counseling and community outreach programs to help the Flint community through this violence.\n\nIn continued efforts to curb the rise of Flint gun violence, Neeley ended the gun buyback program, a program that auctions off confiscated guns back to the public, these funds then go to supporting the Flint police department. Neeley believed ending this program was an essential step towards limiting the guns that return to the streets. The Flint police department now destroyed of all guns that were collected through police work after Neeley's order, which urges that keeping guns out of neighborhoods is more important than the department funding. Neeley states he is not anti-guns but rather is against guns becoming a street currency in Flint.\n\n\nThe City of Flint began their COVID response on Tuesday, March 17, 2020, by closing City Hall. Flint was the second city in Michigan to acknowledge the pandemic as a state of emergency. However, Neeley did not implement a stay-at-home order, instead asking residents to voluntarily limit their social meetings. Flint is the only city in its area to employ a medical advisor to guide them through the pandemic. The city also implemented a program to provide water bill relief to residents during the pandemic, and was the only city in Michigan to do so.\n\n\nAs of 2019, when Neeley was elected, the Flint water crisis was still an issue in the city. The city was still working on changing its water pipes from lead as well as building a water treatment plan. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act provided $100 million dollars to fund these expenditures. As of July 2016, before Neeley took office, the lead in Flint’s water had been within state levels.\n\n\nOn March 8, 2020, Neeley announced his  of  in the .\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

McCotter himself was not suspected of wrongdoing, though several of his staffers were charged with duplicating signatures and other electoral crimes, and some convicted.

On September 22, 2011, McCotter announced the end of his campaign for the presidential nomination, and said that his exclusion from presidential debates had hindered it.

He indicated interest in running against incumbent Democrat  for the U.S. Senate seat in Michigan in 2012, but in May 2011 announced that he would not campaign for the position.\n\nAfter announcing his intention to run for reelection, McCotter was expected to win the Republican nomination easily, but on May 25, 2012,   announced that he had failed to submit enough valid petition signatures to qualify for the August 7 primary ballot. Although McCotter had submitted 2,000 signatures, the maximum permitted by Michigan law for congressional primaries, a preliminary review indicated that fewer than the required minimum of 1,000 were valid. According to a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's office, several of McCotter's petition signatures were duplicates. Michigan election law stipulates that if duplicates are found, both the original and duplicate are ruled invalid. McCotter had the option of running as a write-in candidate in the primary election or as an independent in the general election if he failed to qualify for a primary ballot spot.\n\nAt the time the apparent fraud was uncovered, McCotter was on a congressional trip to .

Numerous petition sheets appeared to have been copiedin some cases, as many as three timesand in some cases a different canvasser's name was attached to one of the copies. Michigan elections director Chris Thomas conducted his own review, and said there was evidence signatures from 2010 petitions had been cut-and-pasted onto the 2012 sheets. Thomas also said that McCotter had only turned in 1,830 signatures, and all but 244 were invalid. His office's review revealed that dozens of petition sheets appeared to have been copied in what he described as an \"unprecedented level\" of fraud.\n\nLate on May 27, the Secretary of State's office announced that it found the potential fraud egregious enough to ask   to look into the matter. In an op-ed that ran in the May 29, 2012, ''Detroit News'', McCotter announced he would mount a write-in campaign in the Republican primary for his seat. He also acknowledged that the signatures in question were indeed invalid, based on his own legal team's review. Likening himself to  in '''', McCotter said that he was running a write-in campaign to \"clean up my own mess.\"\n\nOn June 2, McCotter announced that he was ending his bid for reelection and would leave the House at the end of his term. In his statement, he said that he felt obligated to fulfill his duties in Congress and assist Schuette and Johnson in getting to the bottom of the petition fraud. These obligations, he said, made mounting a write-in bid for Congress impossible. \"One can't clean up a mess multitasking,\" he said. McCotter was the first sitting congressman since the late 1940s not to qualify for his party's primary.\n\nA month later, on July 5, ''The Detroit News'' reported that McCotter had spent much of the time since his presidential campaign failed writing a  script for a comedy/variety show starring himself, to be called ''Bumper Sticker: Made on MoTown''. It featured characters with the same nicknames he used for members of his staff and a guest appearance by conservative commentator . \"They take pot shots about McCotter's ill-fated bid for the White House while spewing banter about drinking, sex, race, flatulence, puking and women's anatomy\", the newspaper wrote.\n\n\nOn July 6, 2012, McCotter resigned from the House.

A  who migrated from New England, he was a successful  businessman turned politician.\n\nAs a businessman turned politician, Pingree was elected mayor in 1889 after a colorful campaign in which Pingree revealed his tolerance by making a circuit of saloons. Pingree added to the old stock Yankee Republican base by making large inroads into the German and Canadian elements. He was reelected in 1891, 1893 and 1895. Warning repeatedly against the dangers of monopolistic corporations, he launched nationally visible crusades against Detroit's streetcar, gas, electric, and telephone companies. He successfully forced rate reductions that won him widespread popularity. He won public approval for a citizen-owned electric light plant and became a national spokesman for municipal ownership and public regulation of utilities and street railways.\n\nWhen the nationwide Panic of 1893 caused a severe depression, Pingree gained support by opening empty lots to garden farming launching Pingree's \"Potato Patch Plan\", initially financed by Pingree, who sold his prize horse to pay for the farming tools and seeds. Pingree was a Republican, whose policies competed for support of the  voters and labor union members. He supported the gold standard in 1896, and worked to carry Michigan for  over silverite  in the intensely competitive 1896 U.S. presidential election.\n\nPingree was on the ballot too, and was elected governor of Michigan. As governor, he succeeded in forcing passage of the nation's first major statewide reappraisal of railroad and corporate property, with intent on implementing taxes. That led to a rational basis for railroad regulation and other trust busting ideas launched by the Republican Party. A survey of scholars in 1985 ranked Pingree as the third-best mayor in all of American history.\n\n\nPingree was born in , to Jasper Pingree and Adeline (Bryant) Pingree and attended the common schools in . At the age of fourteen, he moved to , where he worked at a cotton factory. Two years later, he moved to , and worked several years as a cutter in a shoe factory.\n\n\nIn 1862, Pingree enlisted in the  to serve in the  with the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery Regiment (Company F). He fought on the front line during 's  and the . The regiment he fought with was then ordered to defend Washington, D.C., until May 15, 1864, and then was sent to the front again. He fought with the Second Brigade of Tyler's Division, , which participated in battles at Fredericksburg Road (May 18), Harris Farm (May 19), and  (May 19–21).\n\nHis regiment was then assigned to the Second Corps, Third Division, in the  and fought at North Anna (May 24–25) where he and some other men were captured by a detachment of 's command. Pingree was confined in Confederate prisons at  and , and at . He was then taken to  and, while  was on his march to the sea, he was taken to , where he later escaped by pretending to be someone else during a roll call for a prisoner exchange in November 1864. Pingree rejoined his regiment, fought in many more battles, and was present at  when  surrendered on April 9, 1865. A few months later, on August 15, his regiment was mustered out.\n\n\nPingree was a cobbler by trade and, following the war, moved to Detroit and briefly worked for 's shoe company. In 1866, Pingree and his accountant, Charles H. Smith, purchased Baldwin's shoe-making machinery and formed the Pingree and Smith company.\nIn 1883, Smith retired from the firm and J. B. Howarth and Pingree's son Joe joined the partnership. By 1886, it was a $1 million company with 700 employees turning out a half-million shoes and boots a year. It was the second biggest shoe manufacturer in the U.S. In March 1887, a fire destroyed the entire plant, yet they were able to recover.\n\nIn 1872, Pingree married Frances A. Gilbert of . They had three children – Joe, Hazel, and Gertrude, who died in 1894 of tuberculosis at age 19.\n\n\nPingree had never been active in politics. As a citizen reformer he was elected  in 1889 on a platform of exposing and ending corruption in city paving contracts, sewer contracts, and the school board. He soon turned to fighting privately owned utility monopolies. He challenged the electric and gas monopolies through municipally owned competitors. His largest struggle, however, was with , president of the , over lowering streetcar fares to three cents. Pingree again attempted to create a competing municipally owned company, but was barred from creating a railway by the .Holli, 1970. When the company sought a thirty-year contract with the city, Pingree opposed it, leading a major shareholder, , to express vehement disapproval. (retrieved 24 January 2018).\n\nDuring the severe nationwide , Pingree expanded the public welfare programs, initiated public works for the unemployed, built new schools, parks, and public baths. He gained national recognition through his \"potato patch plan\", which allowed poor people to use  of vacant city land for growing food. He was also an advocate of economist 's .\n\nA 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the  saw Pingree ranked as the fourth-best mayor of a major American city to serve between the years 1820 and 1993.\n\n\n\nIn 1896 Pingree was nominated as the GOP candidate for . He campaigned on a platform of pluralism, inviting the Germans and other ethnics to join a grand coalition that would bring prosperity to everyone, unlike the false prosperity promised by the silverites. He carried the state both for himself and Republican presidential candidate .\n\nAfter taking office on January 1, 1897, he intended to also fill the last year of his term as mayor of Detroit, which would have lasted until elections in November 1897. However, his right to hold the two offices simultaneously was contested, and after the  ruled against him, Pingree resigned as mayor.\n\nDuring his four years in office, Pingree promoted the regulation of railroad rates, equal taxation, and municipal ownership of public utilities. He also supported the direct election of U.S. senators; an ; an income tax; primary elections; the power of \"referendum\", the abolition of child labor, and compulsory arbitration of labor disputes. Opposition from Democrats and business-oriented Republicans blocked most of his proposals. Pingree expressed the Progressive fear of corporate power, saying, \"I do not condemn corporations and rich men\", he said, \"but I would keep them within their proper spheres. It is not safe to entrust the government of the country to the influence of Wall Street.\"\n\n\n, Detroit.]] Pingree did not run for reelection in 1900. In 1901, Pingree arrived in London, England, while returning from an African safari with his son. He was stricken with  and was unable to return to the U.S. , Pingree's famous look alike, even sent his own physicians to London's Grand Hotel to assist in Pingree's recovery.\n\nPingree was interred at the , Detroit, Michigan, and later reinterred at the  in Detroit.

In a video interview conducted shortly after the incident, he characterized the protests as \"a peaceful demonstration where people [were] exercising their  rights\" in which demonstrators were not \"touching the building or endangering the building in any way,\" and stated that the use of pepper spray was \"not necessary.\" When asked whether the incident would prompt him to run for elected office again, Schauer deflected the question, saying only, \"I'm angry. What the legislature is doing is wrong, it's cowardly.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing the 2012 Right-to-work protests, Democratic polling firm  conducted a survey testing incumbent Republican Governor  against various Michigan Democrats. Their survey found that although Schauer was unknown by 72 percent of Michigan voters, he would lead Snyder in a hypothetical election, 44 percent to 39 percent. On February 8, 2013, Schauer was interviewed on WKAR's ''Off the Record'', where he stated that he was considering running for governor but that he wasn't \"there yet.\" He admitted some reluctance to commit to a campaign, noting that his \"two favorite words in the English language for me are 'Grandpa Schauer.'\"\n\n  , who had removed herself from consideration in January, stated in April 2013 that she expected Schauer to be nominated unopposed. In May 2013,  reported that the  had identified Schauer as a \"formidable opponent\" to Snyder, and a number of potential rivals for the Democratic nomination gave their support to a potential Schauer candidacy. Michigan Board of Education president John Austin endorsed Schauer, saying \"I look forward to helping Mark any way I can, and working with Mark to promote what's best for Michigan.\" Former U.S. Representative , who had previously been identified as a leading potential candidate, issued a statement in support of a potential Schauer campaign, saying \"[Schauer is] one of the hardest-working people I've ever met, and I know he'd make a terrific governor.\"  Mayor , the , echoed those sentiments, stating that \"Mark Schauer is the right candidate at the right time. He brings the energy and passion that Democrats will rally around, and he brings the know-how and policy expertise that Michigan needs.\"\n\nOn May 14, 2013, Schauer told the  that he was \"strongly leaning toward putting a campaign together.\" Ten days later, Senators  and  and U.S. Representatives , , , , and  issued a joint endorsement of Schauer's potential candidacy. On May 28, Schauer made it official that he is running for Michigan governor.\n\nSchauer lost to incumbent Governor Rick Snyder on November 4, 2014.\n\n\nAfter the election, Schauer became Chairman of the super PAC Advantage 2020, which aims to help Democrats retake state legislative chambers ahead of the 2020 census and subsequent redistricting, which will redraw Congressional district boundaries.\n\n\n\n\nUpon receiving the endorsement of the , Schauer stated his intention to be \"the education governor\" if elected. Appearing in an ad produced by the  in January 2014, Schauer highlighted his father's career as a high school science teacher and attacked incumbent Governor  for signing a budget that cut education spending by $1 billiona figure disputed by the Snyder campaign.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, Schauer's campaign released a document outlining his priorities for public education, including plans to universal publicly funded pre-school; establishing state standards for maximum class sizes; and eliminating the controversial  instituted under Snyder's administration. A Snyder campaign spokesperson criticized the plan for lacking specific details about funding and implementation; Schauer defended his plan and criticized Snyder for \"[running] in 2010 without telling anybody what he would do.\"\n\nFollowing a series of articles published by the  detailing a year-long investigation of  in Michigan, Schauer called for \"more accountability and transparency,\" and criticized charter schools that operate as  organizations.\n\n\nIn November 2013, Schauer proposed increasing Michigan's  from $7.40 per hour to $9.25 per hour over three years, and then indexing future minimum wage increases to . Incumbent Governor Rick Snyder indicated that such a change would not be a part of his agenda, with a spokesperson explaining that increasing the minimum wage \"hasn't been a burning issue because Michigan is already above the federal minimum.\"\n\nPublic opinion polling indicated broad support for increasing Michigan's minimum wage, with 65 percent of voters supporting a proposed ballot initiative that would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over three years. With the ballot initiative expected to boost Democratic turnout in the November 2014 elections, the majority-Republican  moved to support a minimum wage increase to just $8.15 per hour, which would preempt the $10.10 proposal and keep the initiative off the ballot in November.\n\nHowever, disagreement within the  Republican caucus meant the $8.15 proposal could not pass with Republican votes alone. On May 15, 2014, the Michigan Senate passed compromise legislation raising the minimum wage to $9.20 per hour over three years, supported by the majority of the Senate Democratic caucus and half of the Senate Republicans. Schauer appeared on the floor of the Senate arm-in-arm with Republican Majority Leader , congratulating Richardville and highlighting the similarities between his original proposal and the legislation that had just been passed. The final version of the legislation (passed on May 27, 2014, and signed by Snyder later that day) increased the minimum wage to $9.25 per hour over three years, then indexing future increases to inflationnearly identical to Schauer's November 2013 proposal.\n\n\nIn an op-ed in , Schauer criticized incumbent Governor Rick Snyder for what he characterized as \"the Snyder Senior Tax.\" Schauer cited taxes on retirement income instituted in 2012 and potential cuts in pensions as part of the settlement in the  before concluding that \"[s]eniors and retirees are paying more in taxes because of Snyder’s tax policies.\"\n\nSchauer has also objected to what he calls \"a massive $1.8 billion tax cut to businesses,\" referencing the 2011 elimination of the Michigan Business Tax. Schauer has contrasted this tax cut with cuts in education spending and tax increases on pensions, saying that \"[w]e've got to get our priorities right and we've got to get our fundamentals right.\"\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the  rulings in '''' and '''', Schauer called upon incumbent Governor  to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states and indicated that if elected, he would seek to legalize same-sex marriage in Michigan as well. When Michigan's bans on same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples were overturned in '''', Schauer issued a statement supporting the ruling and encouraged Snyder and Michigan Attorney General  to not appeal the decision. Four Michigan counties issued 323 marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the ruling but before an appeals court stayed on the decision, and Schauer has encouraged the state of Michigan to recognize those marriages.\n\nSchauer's running mate for ,   , is one of the county clerks who issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples prior to the appeal.\n\n\n*'''2010 Election for the U.S. Representative – Michigan's 7th District'''\n\n*'''2008 Election for the U.S. Representative – Michigan's 7th District'''\n\n*'''2006 Election for the Michigan State Senate – 19th District'''\n\n*'''2002 Election for the Michigan State Senate – 19th District'''\n\n*'''2000 Election for the Michigan State House – 62nd District'''\n\n*'''1998 Election for the Michigan State House – 62nd District'''\n\n*'''1996 Election for the Michigan State House – 62nd District'''\n\n\n\nSchauer lives in Battle Creek with his wife, Christine Schauer.

She previously served in the Michigan House of Representatives from the 3rd district from 2007 to 2010.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2010 Representative Scott worked to amend the Driver Responsibility Act of 2003 while serving on the Michigan House's Labor committee and Regulatory Reform committee. In her final year she proclaimed success at repealing the driver responsibility fees resulting from that act through legislation passed in 2018.\n\n\nDuring the 2018 Democratic primary for the state Senate, Scott made racist remarks towards people of Asian heritage, including to her opponent, Michigan state representative . Witnesses reported Scott calling Chang and her volunteers \"\" or \"ching chang\" and accusing one of Chang's campaign volunteers of being an \"immigrant\", saying \"you don't belong here\" and \"I want you out of my country.\" Chang's husband, an , reported hearing Scott saying that it \"disgusts [Scott] seeing black people holding signs for these Asians and not supporting their own people,\" and that he was a \"fool\" for marrying Chang.\n\nStephanie Chang commented on Scott's remarks, saying \"These comments are offensive to all Asian-Americans. It isn't about me. It's about an elected official disrespecting entire populations, whether they be Asian-American, immigrant, or residents of Sen. District 1 or [Scott's] own current house district.\"\n\nScott has since made an apology for her remarks, and did not deny the accusations. Through a representative, she released a statement saying, \"I deeply regret the comments I made that have proven hurtful to so many. Those are words I never should have said. I humbly apologize to Representative Chang, her husband, Mr. Gray, and to the broader  community for those disparaging remarks. In the divisive age we find ourselves in, I should not contribute further to that divisiveness. I have reached out to Representative Chang to meet with her so that I may apologize to her in person. I pray she and the Asian American community can find it in their hearts to forgive me.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the loss of the state Senate primary election on August 7, 2018, Scott never returned to the state House in Lansing to pursue the business of her constituents, missing 197 votes for her entire term of office (2017–18). This was despite her assertion on September 23 that she looked forward to serve her constituents. By November 2018, the Michigan House's business office had effectively ''de facto'' taken over her office's duties until the end of her term, including addressing the needs of the residents of the 2nd House district in her stead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While in private practice, she successfully represented the  in '''' (2014).\n\n\n convention]]\nIn , Nessel won the  nomination for Michigan Attorney General over former  for   She then narrowly defeated    and three other candidates in the general election. She succeeded term-limited Republican  who ran unsuccessfully for the office of Governor.\n\nNessel was sworn into office on January 1, 2019. She is the first openly LGBTQ person elected to statewide office in Michigan. She is the first Democrat to serve as attorney general since  left the office in 2003, sixteen years earlier to become the new Michigan Governor.\n\nNessel immediately withdrew Michigan from eight federal lawsuits initiated by Schuette involving the separation of church and state, LGBTQ discrimination, environmental protection, and abortion.\n\n\nAfter a rise of s in Michigan for two years in a row, Nessel launched a Hate Crimes Unit within the Criminal Division of the Department of Attorney General. Before Nessel took office, the Michigan Department of Attorney General did not have any personnel assigned solely to the investigation and prosecution of s.\n\n\nNessel launched a new Conviction Integrity Unit within the Department of Attorney General's Criminal Appellate Division. The unit investigates credible claims of innocence and rectifies wrongful convictions. To do this, officials work with county prosecutors, law enforcement officials, defense attorneys, and innocence clinic projects.\n\n\nUnder her Consumer Protection Division, Nessel launched the state's first Payroll Fraud Enforcement Unit to investigate Michigan establishments that illegally misclassify workers or  withhold wages and benefits. She also established the Department's Auto Insurance Fraud Unit, which received over 3,000 cases in four months.\n\nKeeping her promise to protect and defend consumers and ratepayers, Nessel saved utility customers $3.6 million after intervening in SEMCO Energy's gas recovery plan case. As of the end of 2019, Nessel has helped save Michigan utility ratepayers a combined $355,809,700.\n\n\nIn collaboration with the , Nessel launched the Michigan  Task Force to combat physical abuse, financial exploitation, emotional abuse, and neglect of senior citizens. Nearly 50 different organizations including law enforcement, state agencies, the , , Michigan Congressional delegation, and advocacy groups, have joined the task force. The task force initiatives include requiring professional guardians to become certified, developing statutory basic rights for families, reviewing the process of a guardian removing a ward from their home, and limiting the number of wards per guardian.\n\n\nIn March 2021, Nessel decided not to launch a criminal investigation into the impact of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's  policy of placing elderly patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in the same nursing home facilities as patients who did not contract coronavirus. At the time of Nessel's decision, an estimated 35% of all Michigan coronavirus deaths had occurred in long-term care facilities. The Michigan state government had been accused of underreporting deaths from COVID-19 that had occurred in long-term care facilities, and had denied freedom of information requests to investigate the matter. The Michigan Office of the Auditor General later reviewed the state's coronavirus data and found that the long-term care facility coronavirus death count up to July 2021 had underreported deaths in these facilities by 42%, while Governor Whitmer denies the findings in the audit. Auditor General  claimed that his office \"didn't feel the word 'underreport' was fair. We cited it as a difference.\"\n\n\nNessel started a statewide campaign to crack down on illegal robocalls targeting Michigan residents. This campaign includes initiatives to educate the public, toughen enforcement, and update state law. As of March 2020, over 2,400 caller complaints of illegal robocalls had been received by Nessel's office.\n\nAdditionally, Nessel joined a bipartisan group of state attorneys general in filing a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in ''''; the AGs argued in favor of preserving the anti-robocall provisions of the federal .\n\n\n\nOn March 2, 2023, Nessel announced that she was among several Jewish government officials targeted in antisemitic threats made on social media by a heavily armed Michigan man. Jack Eugene Carpenter III, of , was charged in  with transmitting an interstate threat, a felony. Carpenter was accused of tweeting from Texas in February 2023: \"I'm heading back to Michigan now threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is jewish in the Michigan govt if they don't leave, or confess.\" Carpenter possessed three handguns, a shotgun, two rifles, and was under investigation for stealing a handgun, according to federal prosecutors. Commenting on the threat on Twitter, Nessel stated: \"It is my sincere hope that the federal authorities take this offense just as seriously as my Hate Crimes & Domestic Terrorism Unit takes plots to murder elected officials.\"\n\n\n\nNessel took over the department's investigation into  from her predecessor, Bill Schuette. As of December 2019, the Department of Attorney General has received 641 tips on its clergy abuse hotline, identified 270 priests alleged to be abusers from dioceses in , , and , and received allegations involving 552 victims of clergy sexual abuse since the beginning of the investigation. So far, 1.5 million paper documents and 3.5 million electronic documents have been seized. The investigation team has reviewed 130 cases for potential charges, 50 of which were closed because the statute of limitations barred prosecution or the priest in question had died. Twenty-five cases have been referred back to the diocese for action because the priests were in active ministry.\n\nIn a February 2019 news conference, Nessel accused Catholic Church leadership of failing to cooperating with law enforcement, and criticized them for encouraging some victims to sign confidential settlements or s. Nessel told church officials to stop \"self-policing\" sexual abuse within the church and to encourage victims to talk with state investigators, adding \"If an investigator comes to your door and asks to speak with you, please ask to see their badge and not their .\" Some criticized Nessel for the \"rosary\" statement, viewing it as an insensitive barb against a devotional practice.\n\nIn October 2020, Nessel released interim report with results of her office's two-year investigation; the office's report accused 454 priests of sexually abusing 811 people in the state of Michigan across . Eleven priests were charged in Michigan with sex crimes from 2019 onward: several pleaded guilty, with  proceedings against others were pending. In October 2022, Nessel released a detailed report on allegations of sexual abuse in the , listing abuse allegations, dating back to 1950, against  44 priests., Dana Nessel, Attorney General (October 27, 2022). This is the first of seven diocese-by-diocese final reports that the AG's Office plans to release.\n\n\nAfter the  scandal, Nessel's office launched an investigation into  (MSU). Nessel charged two former university employees and one former university employee. Kathie Klages, the head coach for MSU's gymnastics team while Nassar was team doctor; , who was MSU president during the investigation (and remains an MSU professor); and William Strampel, former dean of the . Strampel, who as dean was a former boss of Nasser, was convicted in a  of one felony count of misconduct in office and two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty, and an appeals court upheld the convictions in 2021. Klages was convicted of  in 2018 and sentenced to 90 days in jail, but the  vacated the conviction in 2022 on a 2&ndash;1 vote. The charges against Simon were dismissed in 2020; Nessel's office appealed, but a Michigan Court of Appeals panel unanimously upheld the dismissal in 2022; in a , Judge  criticized the investigation into Simon as a \"sham\" and wrote that the former university president was a \"scapegoat\" and \"high profile target, selected to assuage public anger rather than to protect the integrity of the law.\"\n\nIn 2019, Nessel said her department is at an impasse with MSU as they continue to withhold more than 6,000 documents under the claim of attorney-client privilege. Nessel, survivors, and activists continue to call on the university to release the documents. In 2023, the MSU board of trustees voted against waiving privilege over the documents.\n\n\nIn 2018, Michigan passed legislation approved under  codifying an agreement between the state and  Energy to replace the , sitting on the lakebed underneath the  with a tunnel below the bedrock. Despite a judge's ruling upholding the law in March 2019, Nessel issued an opinion that month stating the law was unconstitutional “because its provisions go beyond the scope of what was disclosed in its title.\" After Enbridge filed a lawsuit, a Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled in favor of Enbridge and rejected Nessel's reasoning, stating, \"the argument advanced by defendants misses the mark.\"\n\nUpon appeal to the , Nessel's request to overturn the Court of Claims decision was denied and her opinion was again overruled, allowing Enbridge to continue work on the tunnel and requiring the state to process the necessary permits.\n\nIn June 2019, Nessel filed suit independently in Ingham County Circuit Court, seeking an order requiring Line 5 to shut down (permanently decommission) \"after reasonable notice\"; the suit argues that the operation of Line 5 violates the , is a common-law , and violates the Michigan Environmental Protection Act because of its likeliness to cause pollution to and destruction of the  and other natural resources. The attorneys general of Minnesota, Wisconsin and California have filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Nessel's lawsuit. In 2021, the case was  to federal court. Proceedings were delayed while the parties battled over whether the suit would be heard in state or federal court; in August 2022, a federal judge ruled that the case would be heard in federal court.\n\n\nIn January 2020, Nessel filed suit against seventeen companies, including  and , alleging the toxic  chemical manufacturers “intentionally hid” known health and environmental risks from the public and state while continuing to sell the PFAS chemicals since the 1950s. The suit seeks to hold the companies financially responsible for all past and future costs associated with the contamination at dozens of sites across the state of Michigan.\n\n\n\nWhile campaigning to become Attorney General for Michigan, Nessel made a series of statements regarding the  and its investigation leading up to the  which took place on November 6, 2018.\n\n* On April 4, 2018, then-candidate Nessel met with community members at the  and spoke with , a local television station which serves Flint and the  area. If elected, Nessel said she would not be held to corporate interests, and would protect the citizens of Flint. \"The last thing we need is to have people in government that poison their own residents, that engage in cover-ups, or who use a terrible incident like that to politicize the office of attorney general and use it for their own personal gain. We need someone who just cares about our state residents once again and that’s what I want to do,” said Nessel.\n* On October 12, 2018 Nessel told , a public radio station in , she \"did not believe that these cases have been handled correctly.” Nessel hinted at the possibility of withdrawing or dismissing charges, saying \"whether or not there are bad actors that should have been charged or not, including the governor, I think that has to be reevaluated and reexamined,” she says.\n* Nessel had told the  on October 18, 2018 she \"could see [the potential for expanded prosecutions]\" and \"did not agree with the way the prosecutions [had] unfolded.\" Nessel cited her opposition to Todd Flood, a prominent donor to then , being named as the crisis' special prosecutor who would potentially investigate Snyder.\n* That same day, Nessel had told  she was \"suspect of [the Flint] investigation quite frankly from the beginning. Nessel felt \"political expediency was being prioritized instead of justice.\" As Attorney General, she said she would \"take a second look at the investigation, make certain that all of the people who have charges pending have been charged properly and look to see if there’s anyone who should have been charged, but who hasn’t been.\"\n* In a series of three videos produced and released between September and October 2018 by her campaign, \"Dana Nessel For Michigan Attorney General,\" Nessel stood before Michigan's waterways and promised a tough stance on justice for the city of Flint along with committing to other protections regarding clean water for Michiganders.\n\n\nAfter assuming office and taking over the investigation of the Flint Water Crisis from , Nessel announced that she would be handling the settlements of the 79 Flint civil lawsuits while Solicitor General  and Wayne County Prosecutor  would handle the criminal cases.\n\nOn June 13, 2019, Michigan Attorney General Nessel's office dismissed all pending criminal cases tied to the . Under Michigan's previous attorney general, a Republican, 15 people were charged with crimes related to the water crisis. Several pleaded no contest and were convicted. Prosecutorial overreach possibly tainting the judicial process plagued the investigation from the beginning.\n\nThe dismissal effectively ended prosecutions of eight current and former officials accused of neglecting their duties and allowing Flint residents to drink tainted, dangerous water. Children of Flint drank poisoned water with dangerous quantities of lead. At least 12 people died in a Legionnaires’ outbreak that prosecutors linked to the water change. Among the officials whose charges were dropped: the former director of the , a state epidemiologist, a former Flint public works director and emergency managers who had been appointed to oversee the city. Some defendants had faced charges as serious as involuntary manslaughter. The defence lawyer for Howard Croft, the former Flint public works director who was charged with involuntary manslaughter, said the \"attorney general’s decision validated his concerns about the investigation\" and credited Nessel's \"courage\" in deciding to dismiss all criminal charges.\n\nThe decision to dismiss all charges was met with considerable outrage from Michiganders, clean water activists, and residents of Flint, the latter who felt their crisis was being forgotten. Prosecutors Fadwa Hammoud and Kym Worthy, who oversaw the case, blamed missteps by the previous prosecution team for their office's decision, citing \"immediate and grave concerns about the investigative approach and legal theories.\" Hammoud and Worthy noted they were not precluded from refiling charges against the defendants or adding new charges and defendants.\n\nNessel defended her prosecutors’ decision to drop the charges, but also sought to assuage the concerns of Flint residents, stating \"justice delayed is not always justice denied.\"\n\nNessel has since opened the first ever satellite location of the Attorney General's Office in Flint. Two victim advocates reside in the office along with the Flint Water Crisis prosecution team.\n\n\nNessel filed a lawsuit on behalf of the state of Michigan in December 2019 against opioid distributors using a law to pursue drug dealers. Nessel said that Michigan is the first state to sue drug manufacturers in this way. The companies involved in the suit are Illinois-based , Ohio-based  Inc., Texas-based , and Pennsylvania-based  Drug Corporation. According to the suit, the defendant drug companies sold opioids “in ways that facilitated and encouraged their flow into the illegal, secondary market” without proper safeguards, and they failed to monitor or report suspicious orders, including by knowingly selling pain pills to so-called pill mills. The damages against the defendants are projected to exceed $1 billion.\n\n\nShortly after taking office, Nessel changed state policy to require that contracts with adoption agencies refusing to work directly with LGBT couples be terminated; previously, such agencies had been allowed (and been required) to refer LGBT couples to different adoption agencies. The St. Vincent adoption agency, a Catholic organization, sued Nessel, asking to be allowed to continue operating under state contract as before the new policy. U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker ruled in favor of the adoption agency, writing that \"the state's new position targets St. Vincent's religious beliefs.\" Nessel requested a stay of the ruling, but Jonker denied this as well, stating, \"the state has offered nothing new and has failed to come to grips with the factual basis on the preliminary injunction record that supports the inference of  in this case.\" In March 2022, the state agreed to pay $550,000 to reimburse St. Vincent's legal fees, along with an additional $250,000 to Catholic Charities of West Michigan, also to reimburse legal fees in a similar case.\n\n\nShortly after assuming office, Nessel joined a coalition of other attorneys general in a lawsuit to support the  (PPACA). Nessel cites the “hundreds and thousands” of residents in Michigan who would lose access to healthcare, particularly those with pre-existing conditions, as her reason for joining the suit. The  upheld the PPACA in 2021.\n\n\nNessel announced in January 2022 that after a months-long inquiry into the Michigan participants in the , she had closed down the state probe and asked the U.S. Justice Department to open a criminal investigation. Deputy U.S. attorney general  confirmed days later that the Justice Department was examining the matter. Nessel announced in January 2023 that she was reopening her investigation \"because I don't know what the federal government plans to do.\"\n\nOn July 18, 2023, Nessel announced that she had charged sixteen individuals with eight felony counts each, including forgery. According to Nessel, these individuals had knowingly signed a false  claiming to be the \"duly elected and qualified electors\" for Michigan.\n\n\nNessel met her wife Alanna Maguire while they were both working on the legal case '''', which was ultimately successful in striking down Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage. Nessel proposed to Maguire in 2015 outside of the . The couple married in July 2015 with the marriage being officiated by Judge , the judge who had originally struck down Michigan's same-sex marriage ban in March 2014.\n\nNessel and Maguire have twin sons, Alex and Zach, who attend Michigan State University.

Cockrel served as a member of Detroit's Common Council, from his swearing-in in 1978 until 1982. In addition to winning major cases representing poor and working class Detroiters, Cockrel rose to political prominence as he helped organize social and political movements, including the League of Revolutionary Black Workers and other radical black,  formations.\n\n\nKenneth Vern Cockrel was born November 5, 1938, in , a poor, black community just across Detroit's northern border. His father, Sye Cockrel, worked at the Ford Highland Park plant and his mother, Cynthia Cockrel, was the first African-American graduate of Lincoln High School in Ferndale, Michigan. Both parents died when Cockrel was twelve years old and he went to live with relatives in Detroit. Cockrel attended  and s but dropped out of high school in 1955 at the age of seventeen. After dropping out, Ken joined the United States Air Force, trained as a weapons technician (with special security clearance) and was stationed in Germany as an airman second class. After his discharge in 1959, Cockrel returned to the United States and entered Wayne State University and enrolled in a special program for adults without diplomas; he graduated in 1964 with a degree in political science. Realizing that law would be at the center of the struggle for social and economic justice, Ken immediately enrolled in Wayne State's law school and received his law degree in 1967.\n\n\nKen Cockrel took a job at the  to support himself while in school. There he met  and , who were organizing black auto workers against abuses at auto plants and against racist, unresponsive, and corrupted union leadership within the . With many others, they formed the  in 1969 as an organization that united local \"Revolutionary Union Movements\"  (like ). In 1971, due to political and personal differences Cockrel resigned from the League and the Black Workers Congress. As a result, Cockrel and some  defectors formed the multi-racial Labor Defense Coalition, an organization which would prove instrumental in forcing the dismantling of , the undercover police unit hated in Detroit's black community for heinous (sometimes deadly) abuses.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, Cockrel helped found Philo, Maki, Ravitz, Pitts, Moore, Cockrel & Robb, a law firm which, under various names, provided legal representation for individuals and organizations involved in the struggle against political\nand economic repression. Over the next ten years, he and his colleagues earned reputations as crusaders for working and poor people, winning a number of high-profile cases that put the establishment on trialthe judiciary and jury selection\nprocess in the case following the New Bethel raid incident, the corporation and assembly line in the incredibly successful defense of autoworker James Johnson, the police in the defense of Hayward Brown and Madeline Fletcher. In 1973, the Detroit Branch of the NAACP awarded Cockrel the Distinguished Achievement Medal for his legal work representing members of various social justice movements facing political repression and intimidation by the police and prosecutors.\n\n\nIn 1977, Ken Cockrel was elected to a seat on the Detroit Common Council as an \"independent socialist.\" A number of the community members, volunteers, and his close political allies who worked on his Ccouncil campaign formed an organization known as the Detroit Alliance for a Rational Economy (DARE). This organizations served as a research team that helped brief Cockrel on topics like tax abatements for wealthy developers and corporations and public health. DARE also served as a mass political force that called for strong community control of the most basic urban institutions. Using this arm of his political network for support and mobilizing power, Cockrel often stood out as a lone voice pushing back against Mayor 's collaborations with wealthy developers while supporting his efforts to stamp out police brutality and corruption. His close comrade and campaign manager, , became his Chief of Staff. Ken Cockrel had become the most well-known and influential radical in the city, respected, even by his adversaries, for his intellect, rapid-fire eloquence and passionate commitment to fighting inequity and injustice. Disillusioned at his inability to use his Council position to improve conditions in the city, he decided not to run for re-election in 1981; he would serve on the Council until 1982. According to then Michigan Supreme Court Justice and eventual Mayor of Detroit, , Ken had a great deal of respect for Mayor  even though they were political adversaries on a number of economic and social issues; he states in a media appearance in May 1989 that Sheila Cockrel indicated that the week Ken died, they were having dinner with Coleman Young.\n\n\nWhile at , Cockrel met his first wife, Carol White; they married and had a son, future Detroit City Council President, and eventual Mayor, \n\nBy 1988, Cockrel had returned to the practice of law, ultimately rejoining his friend and former colleague, Justin Ravitz, at Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz, and was considering a run for mayor when he died of a heart attack on April 25, 1989.\n\nIn 1978, Ken Cockrel married his longtime political ally and campaign manager (and future City Councilwoman) . Together they had one daughter, Katherine (or Katy). Katy produced a film featured in the 2019 Detroit Free Press Film Festival titled \"Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win\", chronicling Ken's work against police brutality in Detroit, successfully helping to abolish . The film won the festival's audience choice award.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*  at the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Young was first appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court in 1999, elected in 2000 and 2002, and again won reelection in 2010 for a term ending in 2019. Justice Young announced he would be retiring from the court at the end of April 2017. Young is a self-described judicial traditionalist or . In June 2017, Young announced his intentions to run against  in the 2018 senate race, but  later dropped out saying he could not raise enough money for his campaign.\n\n\nYoung was born in , and grew up in , . Young has recounted how he was raised in a city that was operating under de facto  at the time; when he was a child, his family was one of the first to integrate northwest Detroit. He attended Detroit public elementary schools and graduated from  in 1970, with honors from  in 1974, and from  in 1977.\n\n\nIn 1978, Young joined the law firm of , where he became a partner in 1982. In 1992, he joined AAA Michigan where he served as general counsel. In 1995, Young was appointed to the , and later elevated to the  by Governor  in 1999 to replace resigning Chief Justice .\n\nAt his investiture ceremony on February 18, 1999, Judge , of the  administered the oath of office to Young. To mark the occasion, his former law partner at Dickinson Wright, Detroit Mayor  explained that Young possessed \"excellent skill, a great work ethic, and great judicial temperament.\" Attorney General and future-Governor  called Young \"a man of tremendous talent and assiduousness[,] ... an unbelievably fair person[,] ... [and] a rich, wonderful, thoughtful, and fair asset to the Supreme Court of Michigan.\" Governor  explained that Young \"is a brilliant scholar, learned in both the state and United States Constitutions.\"\n\nYoung won statewide campaigns in 2000 for the remainder of former justice 's term, and in 2002 and 2010 for full eight-year terms, the latter of which expires in 2019. During Young's tenure on the court, an op-ed appeared in '''' praising Young in particular and calling the Michigan Supreme Court \"what may be the finest court in the nation\" and \"a leader in attempting to restore a proper balance between the judiciary, the legislature and the people.\"\n\nYoung is an adjunct professor at . Known for his community involvement in the greater  area, Young currently serves as chairman of the board for Vista Maria, a Detroit-based charity for disadvantaged young women. He has previously served as a member of the advisory board of the United Community Services of Metropolitan Detroit and as a member of the board of trustees of .\n\nYoung was named the Jurist of the Year by the Police Officer's Association of Michigan in 2000 and again in 2010.\n\nYoung was named the American Justice Partnership's \"Guardian of Justice\" in 2010. The group explained that Young is a \"tireless protector of the U.S. Constitution, strong and steady defender of our nation's principles of justice, and unstinting adherent to the intentions and ideals of our nation's founders.\"\n\nYoung was elected Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court on January 5, 2011.\n\nYoung, along with fellow  Justice , was on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court justices in May 2016, though the appointment went to Judge  of the , who was confirmed by the  on April 7, 2017.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, Justice Young announced that he would retire from the Michigan Supreme Court by April 30 of that year to return to private practice. His retirement from the court became official on April 17, 2017.\n\nIn April 2017, Young confirmed he was being courted to seek the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen.  in . He officially joined the race in June 2017 but withdrew from the race in January 2018.\n\n\n\nYoung authored the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in ''Wayne County v. Hathcock'' (2004), which involved a dispute over the power of eminent domain to transfer privately owned real estate to another private entity for a commercial business and technology park. Decided one year before the landmark  decision in , Young's decision held that the  only allowed eminent domain for \"public use\" and determined that three circumstances justified condemnation through eminent domain to a private entity: \"(1) where 'public necessity of the extreme sort' requires collective action; (2) where the property remains subject to public oversight after transfer to a private entity; and (3) where the property is selected because of 'facts of independent public significance,' rather than the interests of the private entity to which the property is eventually transferred.'\"\n\n''Hathcock'' overturned the 1981 Michigan Supreme Court decision in '' Neighborhood Council v. Detroit,'' which Young criticized as a \"radical and unabashed departure from the entirety of this Court's...eminent domain jurisprudence\" because it \"concluded, for the first time in the history of our eminent domain jurisprudence, that a generalized economic benefit was sufficient under [the Michigan Constitution] to justify the transfer of condemned property to a private entity.\"\n\n\nYoung authored the Michigan Supreme Court's advisory opinion regarding whether election officials can require photo identification before voting in ''In Re Request for Advisory Opinion Regarding the Constitutionality of 2005 PA 71'' (2007). The Court upheld a requirement that voters present photo identification before voting as a \"reasonable, nondiscriminatory\" requirement to vote that has the legitimate goal of preserving the fairness of elections. The Court held that the requirement did not amount to a \"\" or present a severe burden on voters. Young explained: \"the act of reaching into one's purse or wallet and presenting photo identification before being issued a ballot\" is a reasonable requirement, and even those without identification may simply sign an affidavit in lieu of presenting identification or obtain an identification card free of charge from the Secretary of State. Young also explained that the fundamental right to vote includes the assurance that one's vote will not be cancelled out by fraudulent votes, giving the State a compelling interest to prevent voter fraud in elections.\n\n\nYoung authored the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in ''Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation v. Nestle Waters North America'' (2007). which applied Michigan's constitutional standing doctrine to the Michigan Environmental Protection Act. The doctrine of  involves the ability of a person or corporation to bring a lawsuit, and thus assert legal rights and duties in the courts. As Young's opinion explained: \"We vigilantly enforce principles of standing in order to vindicate the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers among the coordinate branches of government to which those respective powers have been committed.\" As the Court had previously articulated in ''Lee v. Macomb County Board of Comm'rs'' (2001), which applied principles of federal  doctrine, standing requires a  to have suffered \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) 'actual or imminent, not \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical\" that has a \"causal connection\" to \"the conduct complained of\" and which is \"likely\" to be \"redressed by a favorable decision\" by a court.\n\nApplying federal and state principles of standing doctrine in ''Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation'', Young's decision concluded that \"[w]here the plaintiff claims an injury related to the environment, this Court lacks the 'judicial power' to hear the claim if the plaintiff cannot aver facts that he has suffered or will imminently suffer a concrete and particularized injury in fact,\" such as \"when the defendant’s activities directly affected the plaintiff’s recreational, aesthetic, or economic interests.\"\n\n\n\nSpecial Prosecutor William Forsyth, who has been tasked with investigating the details surrounding 's crimes, has accused MSU of obstructing his probe by withholding critical information under Young's guidance.  Young's position was vindicated by the court by order dated March 19, 2019, when the court dismissed Forsyth's subpoena finding that MSU had produced all nonprivileged documents.\n\n\nYoung recently published the chapter \"‘Active Liberty’ and the Problem of Judicial Oligarchy\" in ''The Supreme Court and the Idea of Constitutionalism,'' published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 2009. His other publications include \"A Judicial Traditionalist Confronts the Common Law,\" and \"A Judicial Traditionalist Confronts Justice Brennan's School of Judicial Philosophy.\"\n\nYoung is a co-editor of Michigan Civil Procedure During Trial, 2d Ed. (Michigan Institute of Continuing Legal Education, 1989) and Michigan Civil Procedure, (Michigan Institute of Continuing Legal Education, 1999).\n\n\nYoung has been married for over 40 years; he and his wife, Dr. Linda Hotchkiss, have two adult children. They lived in  when Young was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court. Young and his wife currently live in the  area.

A member of the , Thanedar served as a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from 2021 to 2023. He was also a candidate in the Democratic primary for  in the .\n\n\nThanedar grew up in a lower-income family in , , India. When his father was forced to retire at age 55, the 14-year-old Thanedar worked odd jobs to support his family of eight. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry at 18 and then attended a master's program at . He came to the U.S. in 1979 to pursue a PhD at the , which he earned in 1982. Thanedar became a U.S. citizen in 1988.\n\n\nThanedar did post-doctoral work at the  before taking a job in 1984 as a researcher at Petrolite Corp.\n\n\nIn 1984, Thanedar started working at  in . In 1990, Thanedar took a job working nights and weekends for $15/hour at Chemir/Polytech Laboratories to learn the business. He took out a loan to buy Chemir in 1991 for $75,000. Sales in the first year were $150,000 and the business had three employees. By 2005, Chemir's revenues were $16 million and it employed 160 people, including 40 PhD chemists.\n\nThanedar borrowed $24 million from  to finance seven acquisitions, offering the bank a personal guarantee to back the debt. One acquisition, Azopharma, grew rapidly from $1 million in 2003 to $55 million in 2008. Thanedar's group of companies employed 500 people in 2008. He built a mansion in  with an in-home theater to accommodate 150 people.\n\nIn 2007, Thanedar was offered $132 million to sell Azopharma. During the , Azopharma's revenue fell by 70%, triggering  proceedings by Bank of America. Azopharma closed and its assets were sold for $2 million. During the bankruptcy proceedings, AniClin, one of Azopharma's research facilities of which Thanedar was the sole owner, abruptly closed; a 2010 '''' article claimed that laboratory animals were abandoned at the facility after the company was placed in receivership. According to later reports, employees climbed the fences to care for the animals until animal welfare organizations gained legal access and facilitated the adoption of all animals in the facility. Thanedar denied that any animals were abandoned.\n\nChemir remained profitable throughout the legal proceedings and was sold on March 31, 2011, for $23 million. That sale plus the combined assets in the firm covered Thanedar's debt to Bank of America.\n\n\nThanedar briefly retired in 2010, then came out of retirement later that year to launch Avomeen Analytical Services, an Ann Arbor-based chemical testing laboratory, with his son Neil. Avomeen was named to the INC 5000 list of fastest-growing U.S. companies in 2015 (#673) and 2016 (#1365). In 2016, Thanedar sold a majority stake in the business to private equity firm High Street Capital. He shared $1.5 million of the proceeds with his 50 employees.\n\nThanedar was named the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year for the Central Midwest Region (Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska) in 1999, 2007, and 2016., for the Central Midwest Region He maintains 40% ownership of Avomeen.\n\n\nIn November 2017, a buyer of Avomeen Holdings LLC filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Detroit, claiming Thanedar made \"fraudulent and misleading representations\" of his company's finances in order to sell the majority stake in November 2016. Thanedar denies the allegations, saying that revenues \"are anticipated to significantly exceed\" those of past periods. U.S. District Judge  dismissed the case in August 2019, citing a notice from Thanedar and Avomeen Holdings LLC that they had reached an agreement to resolve the matter out of court.\n\n\n\nThanedar entered politics when he ran in the  as a Democrat. His political platform included a $15 minimum wage, public education reform, infrastructure improvements, and increased government transparency.\n\n\n\nOn April 5, 2017, Thanedar submitted paperwork to raise funds for a potential gubernatorial campaign in Michigan. On June 8, he officially announced his candidacy for  in the . He pledged not to accept any corporate  donations. Thanedar contributed $10.6 million of his own money to his campaign. Early polling in 2017 showed him in last place at 2% to 3%. After running a statewide  in February 2018, he quickly became the best-known Democratic candidate for governor. Thanedar won statewide Democratic polls in March (21% to 18%) and April (30% to 26%) versus , the presumptive Democratic front-runner.\n\nAs Thanedar's campaign gained public traction in early 2018, reporters at  and  began investigating Thanedar's history. Thanedar had not held elective office before running for governor in 2017, so he did not have an official record as a Democrat. Campaign finance records show that he made 18 donations to Democratic campaigns and one to a Republican campaign before running for office. The Republican donation, $2,300 to , led to controversy that Thanedar might not be as progressive as he claimed. Political strategists who met with Thanedar before his 2018 campaign also claimed that he initially questioned whether he wanted to run as a Democrat or Republican in the gubernatorial race. Thanedar denied the claims, saying that these strategists were criticizing him because he did not hire their firms. He also faced allegations that laboratory animals were abandoned at one of his former research facilities after Bank of America placed that business into receivership in 2010, which he denied.\n\nThese controversies hurt Thanedar's campaign and he failed to poll over 30% again. In the primary, he won the , but finished third statewide; he received 200,645 votes (17.7%), placing him in third behind Whitmer's 588,436 votes (52.0%) and Abdul El-Sayed's 342,179 votes (30.2%). Thanedar's support was heavily concentrated in cities like Detroit, Flint, Inkster, and Pontiac with high  populations.\n\nThanedar's campaign had spent more money than any other candidate's in either the Democratic or Republican gubernatorial primary. The roughly $10.3 million his campaign spent accounted for nearly one third of the cumulative spending of all candidates in the primaries.\n\n\nIn August 2019, Thanedar submitted paperwork to run for state representative in , a portion of the upper east side of Detroit. On August 4, 2020, he won the Democratic primary for the seat. On November 3, 2020, Thanedar was elected to the state house. He assumed office on January 1, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanedar previously co-sponsored a resolution to halt aid to , describing it as an  state, in . The next year, he faced opposition from  in his run for the US House. In summer 2023, he traveled to Israel on an AIPAC affiliated trip. On return, he described the relationship between Israel and the United States as mutually beneficial.\n\nOn October 11, 2023, the ''Detroit Free Press'' reported that Thanedar had \"renounced his membership in the  (DSA), saying it hasn't adequately denounced Hamas for its '' on Israel last weekend.\" This came after the Detroit DSA had already moved to expel Thanedar after he escorted Indian Prime Minister , whose prime ministership they called \"far right, violent, [and] Islamophobic\", on a  to the US.\n\n\nIn 2023, Thanedar was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President  to remove U.S. troops from  within 180 days. The measure, which was introduced by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., was defeated by a vote of 321-103.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Thanedar gave up his state house seat and moved from  to the  neighborhood to run for . The incumbent, , had her home drawn into the 12th district and was reelected there. Thanedar won the open primary, defeating state senator  and others. Thanedar contributed $5.17 million of his own money to the campaign.

His parents divorced in 1981. Kilpatrick attended Detroit's  and graduated from  with a Bachelor of Science degree in  in 1992. While at FAMU, he played football under NFL Hall of Famer  as an  and was team captain. On September 9, 1995, he married Carlita Poles in Detroit. They have three children together, Jalil, Jonas, and Jelani. In 1999 he received a Juris Doctor from - He has a sister Ayanna and a half-sister, Diarra.\n\nKilpatrick's mother Carolyn was a career politician, representing Detroit in  from 1979 to 1996 and serving in the  for  from 1996 to 2010. She was not re-elected to office because she lost her primary election in August 2010 to State Senator .  and  both noted that throughout her re-election campaign, Carolyn was dogged by questions about Kilpatrick following his tenure as mayor of Detroit.\n\nKilpatrick's father Bernard was a semi-professional  player and politician. He was elected to the  Commission, served as head of Wayne County Health and Human Services Department from 1989 to 2002, and as  to former Wayne  . Later he operated a Detroit consulting firm called Maestro Associates.\n\nKilpatrick filed for divorce from Carlita in 2018. In July 2021 he married Laticia Maria McGee at  in Detroit.\n\n\nKilpatrick was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1996 after his mother vacated her Detroit-based seat to mount a successful bid for Congress. Kilpatrick's campaign staff consisted of high school classmates Derrick Miller and , who became his legislative aide; later, Kilpatrick had an affair with Beatty. According to Kilpatrick, the campaign was run on a budget of $10,000 and did not receive endorsements from s, s, or the Democratic establishment.\n\nKilpatrick was elected minority floor leader for the , serving in that position 1998 to 2000. He was subsequently elected as house minority leader in 2001, the first  to hold that position. , Kilpatrick ran for mayor of Detroit, hiring Berg/Muirhead Associates for his campaign. They were retained as his  firm upon his election. During the , Kilpatrick was a Michigan state co-chair of GoreNet. GoreNet was a group that supported 's  with a focus on  and  organizing as well as hosting small dollar donor events.\n\nIn 2001, Kilpatrick used his influence while in the Michigan legislature to funnel state grant money to two organizations that were vague on their project description. The groups were run by friends of Kilpatrick and both agreed to subcontract work to U.N.I.T.E., a company owned by Kilpatrick's wife Carlita. Carlita was the firm's only employee, and the firm received $175,000 from the organizations. Detroit 3D was one of the groups and the State canceled its second and final installment of $250,000 because 3D refused to divulge details on how the funds were being spent.\n\n\n  in 2005]]\n\n\nOn New Year’s Day 2002, Kilpatrick became the youngest mayor of Detroit when he took office at age 31.\n\nDuring his first term, Kilpatrick was criticized for using city funds to lease a  for use by his family and using his city-issued credit card to charge thousands of dollars' worth of spa massages, extravagant dining, and expensive wines. Kilpatrick paid back $9,000 of the $210,000 credit card charges. Meanwhile, Kilpatrick closed the century-old  and  because of the city's budget problems. The City Council overrode his funding veto for the zoo and gave it a budget of $700,000.\n\nIn 2005, '''' magazine named Kilpatrick as one of the worst mayors in America.\n\n\nSince the 1970s, a federal judge had made the mayor of Detroit the special administrator of the  because of severe pollution issues. When serious questions about water department contracts came to light in late 2005, Judge Feikens ended Kilpatrick's special administratorship in his capacity as mayor. In January 2006, '''' reported that, \"Kilpatrick used his special administrator authority to bypass the water board and City Council on three controversial contracts.\" These included a $131 million radio system for the city's police and fire departments, as well as a no-bid PR contract to a close personal aide.''Detroit News'', \"Kilpatrick out as water chief\" January 6, 2006 But Judge Feikens praised Kilpatrick's work as steward of the department, referring questions on the contracts to the  in charge of that investigation.\n\n\n, official residence of the Mayor of Detroit]]\nIn the fall of 2002, it was alleged that Kilpatrick had held a wild party involving strippers at the Manoogian Mansion, the city-owned residence of the mayor of Detroit. Former members of the Executive Protection Unit (EPU), the mayor's police security detail, alleged that Carlita Kilpatrick, Kilpatrick's wife, came home unexpectedly and physically attacked an , Tamara Greene. Officer Harold C. Nelthrope contacted the  unit of the  in April 2003 to recommend that they investigate abuses by the EPU. Kilpatrick denied any wrongdoing. An investigation by Michigan Attorney General Cox and the  found no evidence that the party took place.\n\nGreene was murdered on April 30, 2003, at around 3:40&nbsp;a.m., near the intersection of Roselawn and West Outer Drive while sitting in her car with her 32-year-old boyfriend. She was shot multiple times with a  . At the time, this was the same model and caliber firearm as those officially issued by the Detroit Police Department. The family believed the killing to have been a \"deliberate hit\".\n\nGreene's family filed a $150 million lawsuit against the city of Detroit in federal court, claiming she was murdered to prevent her testimony about the Manoogian Mansion party. In late 2011, Judge  granted summary judgment in favor of the city. Greene's children appealed the decision, but the  affirmed the district-court decision. Several affidavits were filed in the lawsuit prior to its dismissal; in his summary-judgment order, Judge Rosen wrote, \"[I]t is fair to say that the partiesand, in particular, Plaintiffswere given wide latitude to pursue any and all matters that were arguably relevant to their claims or defenses\". Many affidavits related to whether the party took place and whether Carlita and Greene had been in an altercation. Detroit Police lieutenant Alvin Bowman stated that he had suspected the shooter was a Detroit law-enforcement officer and claimed that high-ranking Detroit Police personnel, including Cummings, deliberately sabotaged his investigation, stating that he was eventually transferred out of the Homicide Division because he had asked too many questions about the Greene murder and the Manoogian Mansion party. Mayer Morganroth, the lawyer representing the city, said, \"The Bowman affidavit is a little less than idiotic and more than absurd.\"\n\n\nIn 2002, the Washington D.C. police announced that they would only offer professional courtesy protection to Kilpatrick while he was conducting official business in the nation's capital. D.C. police no longer provided after-hours police protection to Kilpatrick because of his inappropriate partying during past visits.  Tyrone Dodson of Washington D.C. explained by saying \"we arrived at this decision because we felt that the late evening partying on the part of Mayor Kilpatrick would leave our officers stretched too thin and might result in an incident at one of the clubs.\"  The Kilpatrick administration alleged that the statements and actions of the Washington D.C. police were part of a political conspiracy to \"ruin\" the mayor.\n\n\n\nAt a campaign rally in May 2005, Kilpatrick's father Bernard adamantly argued that allegations that the Mayor had held a party at the  were a lie, likening such statements to the false ing of Jewish people by the s. Bernard later apologized. In October 2005, a third-party group supporting Kilpatrick, named The Citizens for Honest Government, generated controversy by its print advertisement that compared media criticism of the mayor to .\n\nKilpatrick and his opponent , both Democrats, each initially claimed victory. However, as the votes were tallied, it became clear that Kilpatrick had come back from his stretch of unpopularity to win a second term in office. Three months previously, most commentators declared his political career over after he was the first incumbent mayor of Detroit to come in second in a . Pre-election opinion polls predicted a large win for Hendrix; however, Kilpatrick won with 53% of the vote.\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2006, Kilpatrick was hospitalized and diagnosed with  while in , . His personal physician indicated that Kilpatrick's condition may have been caused by a high-protein weight-loss diet. That month, Detroit's City Council had voted unanimously to approve Kilpatrick's tax plan, with which he intended to offer homeowners some relief from the city's high property s. The cuts ranged from 18% to 35%, depending on the property's value.\n\n\nThe city of Detroit was fourteen months late in filing its 2005–2006 . In March 2008, officials estimated the audit would cost an additional $2.4&nbsp;million because of new auditing requirements that were not addressed by the city. The 2006–2007 fiscal year audit due on December 31, 2007, was expected to be eleven months late.\n\nThe state treasury chose to withhold $35&nbsp;million of its monthly revenue sharing to the city and required Detroit to receive approval before selling  to raise money. Kilpatrick told the City Council that he would take partial blame for the late audits because he laid off too many s, but he also blamed the firm hired to replace them. \n\n\nIt was revealed on July 15, 2008, by  reporter Steve Wilson that, in 2005, Kilpatrick, Christine Beatty, and the chief of police Ella Bully-Cummings allegedly used their positions to help an influential Baptist minister arrested for soliciting a prostitute get his case dismissed. The arresting officer, Antoinette Bostic, was told by her supervisors that Mangedwa Nyathi was a minister (Assistant Pastor at Hartford Memorial Baptist Church on Detroit's west side), and that the mayor and police chief were calling to persuade Bostic not to show up to court, in which case the judge would be forced to dismiss the case against Nyathi. Bostic ignored her supervisors and appeared in court.\n\nThe defense lawyer, Charles Hammons, had the case postponed a couple of times and stated in court that \"The mayor told me yesterday that this case is not gonna go forward.\" Hammons admitted to Wilson that this was the fact and that this was how many cases for people who know the mayor in Detroit are handled. Bully-Cummings angrily denied that she had ever asked her officers to perform such acts of impropriety. Kilpatrick stated that Wilson of WXYZ \"was just making up stories again.\"\n\n\nA 2008 ''Detroit Free Press'' article revealed that at any given time there were about 100 appointees of Kilpatrick employed with the city. ''The '' examined city records and found that  within the various city departments. This hiring practice came to be known as 'the friends and family plan'. Some appointees had little to no experience, while others, among them Kilpatrick's uncle Ray Cheeks and cousin Nneka Cheeks, falsified their résumés. Kilpatrick's cousin Patricia Peoples was appointed to the deputy director of human resources, giving her the ability to hire more of Kilpatrick's friends and family without such hirings being viewed as mayoral appointments. Although political appointments are not illegal, the sheer volume of Kilpatrick's appointments compared to all the appointments made by Detroit mayors since 1970, along with Kilpatrick's cutting of thousands of city jobs, made his appointments controversial.\n\nThe jobs held by friends and family ranged from secretarial positions to department heads. The appointees had an average salary increase of 36% compared with a 2% raise in 2003 and 2% raise in 2004 for fellow city workers. Some of the biggest salary increases were for April Edgar, half-sister of Christine Beatty, whose pay increase was 86% over 5 years. One of Kilpatrick's cousins, Ajene Evans, had a 77% increase in his salary during this 5-year period. The biggest salary increase among the 29 appointees was that of LaTonya Wallace-Hardiman who went from $32,500 staff secretary, to an executive assistant making $85,501163% in five years.\n\n\nOn July 24, 2008, at approximately 4 p.m., Wayne County Sheriff's Detective Brian White and Joanne Kinney, an investigator from Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy's office, went to the home of Kilpatrick's sister in an attempt to serve a subpoena. While on the front porch of the home, Kilpatrick came out of the house with his bodyguards and pushed the sheriff's deputy, as Sheriff Warren Evans said, \"with significant force to make [the deputy] bounce into the prosecutor's investigator\". The mayor yelled at Kinney \"How can a black woman be riding in a car with a man named White?\"\n\nEvans went on to say \"There were armed executive protection officers. My officers were there armed. And all of them had the consummate good sense not to let it escalate\"... and \"the two officers 'wisely' left the property and returned to their office to report on the incident.\"\n\nSheriff Evans stated that due to the \"politically charged nature\" of the incident, the case had been transferred to the Michigan State Police to investigate. Evans's daughter, who was on Kilpatrick's staff, resigned shortly after this incident.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2003, a civil lawsuit was filed against Kilpatrick by ex-bodyguard Harold Nelthrope and former Deputy Police Chief Gary Brown, who claimed they were fired in retaliation for an internal-affairs investigation. Brown had led the investigation, and Nelthrope had told investigators about the aforementioned rumors of a party that occurred at the Mayor's mansion. Both claimed that Kilpatrick was motivated, in part, by his concern that the probe would uncover his extramarital affairs. The trial began in August 2007. Kilpatrick and his chief of staff, Christine Beatty, both testified under oath that they were not involved in an . In September 2007, after three hours of deliberation, the jury found in favor of Nelthrope and Brown, awarding $6.5&nbsp;million in damages. After the verdict was read, Kilpatrick said that the racial composition of the jurywhich was mostly white and suburbanhad played a role in the outcome and vowed an appeal.\n]]\n\nIn October, plaintiffs' attorney Mike Stefani received thousands of text messages he had been endeavoring to obtain via subpoenathe messages indicated an affair between Kilpatrick and Beatty.  A day after he presented the files to the city's attorneys, Kilpatrick announced that he had agreed to settle the case, and the city counsel approved the $8.4&nbsp;million deal, which included a proviso that Stefani would turn the files over to the mayor. After the ''Detroit Free Press'' filed a  (FOIA) request, the proviso was removed from the main settlement document and put into a confidential supplement. But the ''Detroit Free Press'' and ''The Detroit News'' filed a FOIA suit, seeking all settlement-related documents, and, in February 2008, the Michigan Supreme Court ordered the settlement documents be turned over to the plaintiffs. The bulk of the text messages were released in late October 2008 by Circuit Court Judge Timothy Kenny, who instructed that some portions be redacted.\n\n began an inquiry that led to the removal of Kilpatrick from office.]]\n\nBeatty resigned from her position as Kilpatrick's chief of staff. The City Council requested that Kilpatrick resign as mayor and that Governor Granholm use her authority to remove him from office. Granholm said the inquiry was like a trial and that her role would be \"functioning in a manner similar to that of a judicial officer.\" Kilpatrick said he had paid back the $8.4&nbsp;million through \"hard work for the city\" and dismissed any intentions of removing himself from office as \"political rhetoric\".\n\n\nIn March 2008, Kilpatrick delivered his seventh \"State of the City\" address to the city of Detroit. The speech marked a turning point in his career. The majority of the 70-minute speech focused on positive changes occurring throughout Detroit and future plans. Kilpatrick specifically noted increased police surveillance, new policing technologies, and initiatives to rebuild blighted neighborhoods. He received repeated s from the invitation-only audience.\n\nToward the end of the speech, Kilpatrick deviated from the transcript given to the media and posted on his official website to address the scandals and controversies surrounding his years in office, saying that the media had focused on those controversies only to increase their viewership, and that their focus had led to racist attacks against him and his family.\n\nKilpatrick's comments generated many negative responses.  and fellow Democrat  issued a statement in which she condemned the use of the  in any context.   stated on   that he thought that using the N-word was \"reprehensible\", saying, \"I thought his statements were  on par with  and , all to save his political career. I'm not a Detroiter, but last night crossed the line ... those statements not only hurt Detroit, [but] as long as the mayor is there, he will be a drag on the whole region.\" Cox said that whether Kilpatrick is criminally charged or not, he should resign as mayor. Former Kilpatrick political adviser Sam Riddle labeled the address a race-baiting speech. \"It's an act of desperation to use the N-word,\" said Riddle. \"He's attempting to regain his base of support by playing the . He's gone to that well one too many times.\"\n\n\nThe Wayne County Election Committee approved a  petition to remove Kilpatrick as mayor based, in part, on the accusation that Kilpatrick misled the City Council into approving the settlement. The recall petition was filed by Douglas Johnson, a city council candidate. Kilpatrick appealed to the commission to reconsider its decision on the grounds that Johnson was not a resident of Detroit. Johnson also requested that Jennifer Granholm use her power as Governor to remove Kilpatrick from office.\n\nOn March 12, 2008, at the request of the Mayor's office, Wayne County Election Commission rescinded its earlier approval for the recall. The Mayor's office argued that there was not any evidence that the organizer, Douglas Johnson, actually resided within the city limits of Detroit. Johnson stated that his group would refile using another person whose residency would not be an issue. On March 27, 2008, a second recall petition was filed against Kilpatrick by Angelo Brown. Brown stated in his filing that Kilpatrick is too preoccupied with his legal problems to be effective. Kilpatrick's spokesman James Canning again dismissed this latest recall by saying: \"It's Mr. Brown's right to file a petition, but it's just another effort by a political hopeful to grab headlines.\"\n\nOn May 14 the  voted to request that the governor of Michigan, , remove Kilpatrick from office.\n\n\n\n}}\n\nOn March 24, 2008, Wayne County Prosecutor  announced a twelve-count criminal indictment against Kilpatrick and Beatty, charging Kilpatrick with eight  and Beatty with seven. Charges for both included perjury, misconduct in office, and obstruction of justice. Worthy suggested that others in the Kilpatrick administration could also be charged.\nThe preliminary examination scheduled for September 22, 2008, was waived by both defendants, thereby allowing the case to proceed directly to trial.\n\nIn July 2008, Kilpatrick violated the terms of his bail by briefly traveling to , where he met with Windsor mayor  concerning a deal to have the city of Windsor take over operational control of the  in exchange for a $75 million loan. As a result, on August 7, 2008, Kilpatrick was remanded to spend a night in the Wayne County Jail. It was the first time in history that a sitting Detroit mayor had been ordered to jail. In issuing the order, Chief Judge  stated that he could not treat the mayor differently from \".\" On August 8, 2008, after arguments on Kilpatrick's behalf by attorneys  and Jim Thomas, Judge Thomas Jackson reversed the remand order and permitted Kilpatrick to be released on posting a $50,000 cash bond and the further condition that the mayor not travel, and wear an electronic tracking device.\n\nThe same day Kilpatrick was released under the second bail agreement, Michigan Attorney General  announced that two new felony counts had been filed against the mayor for assaulting or interfering with a law officer. The new charges arose out of allegations that Kilpatrick on July 24, 2008, shoved two Wayne County Sheriff's Deputies who were attempting to  a  on Bobby Ferguson, a Kilpatrick ally, and a potential witness in the mayor's then-upcoming perjury trial.\n\nOn September 4, 2008, Kilpatrick announced his resignation as mayor, effective September 18, and pleaded guilty to two felony counts of obstruction of justice and pleaded no contest to assaulting the deputy. Kilpatrick had agreed to resign as part of the plea agreement, in which he also agreed to serve four months in the Wayne County Jail, pay one million dollars of restitution to the city of Detroit, surrender his license to practice law, submit to five years probation and not run for public office during his probation period, and surrender his state pension from his six years' service in the Michigan House of Representatives before being elected mayor. In an  given as part of his plea, Kilpatrick admitted that he lied under oath several times.\n\nIn the separate assault case, he pleaded  to one felony count of assaulting and obstructing a police officer in exchange for a second assault charge being dropped. This deal also required his resignation and 120 days in jail, to be served concurrently with his jail time for the perjury counts. Kilpatrick was sentenced on October 28, 2008. The judge ordered that Kilpatrick not be given an opportunity for early release, but instead serve the entire 120 days in jail.\n\nDetroit City Council President  replaced Kilpatrick as mayor at 12:01&nbsp;a.m. September 19, 2008.\n\n\nJudge David Groner sentenced Kilpatrick to four months in jail on October 28, 2008, calling him \"arrogant and defiant\" and questioning the sincerity of a guilty plea that ended his career at City Hall. The punishment was part of a plea agreement worked out a month earlier. \"When someone gets 120 days in jail, they should get 120 days in jail,\" Groner said. Kilpatrick also was given a 120-day concurrent sentence for assaulting a sheriff's officer who was trying to deliver a subpoena in July. He was seen smirking, laughing, and even calling the sentencing a \"joke\".\n\nWayne County Sheriff Warren Evans said that they take 40,000 prisoners into the prison annually, but that Kilpatrick would be kept separate from the general population and \"won't be treated any worse or any better than other prisoners.\"\nHe was housed in a secured, 15 feet by 10 feet cell with a bed, chair, toilet and a shower, spending approximately 23 hours a day there. At 12:35&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, February 3, 2009, Kilpatrick left jail after serving 99 days. He boarded a privately chartered Lear jet and landed in Texas that evening. He was supposed to join his family in a $3,000 per month rental house in Southlake, Texas.\n\nWithin a couple of weeks, Kilpatrick was hired by Covisint, a Texas subsidiary of , headquartered in Detroit. CEO of Compuware  was one of the parties who loaned large sums of money to Kilpatrick in late 2008. Kilpatrick was let go from Compuware in May 2010 after being sentenced to prison.\n\n\nKilpatrick claimed poverty to Judge David Groner. He said he only had $3,000 per month (later lowered to $6) for the restitution payments.\n\nJudge Groner requested detailed financial records for Kilpatrick, his wife, their children, etc. By November 2009, Kilpatrick was on the stand in Detroit to explain his apparent poverty. He claimed to have no knowledge about who paid for his million-dollar home, s, and other lavish expenses. The former mayor also denied any knowledge of his wife's finances, or even whether she was employed. During this hearing, it was revealed that ,  and other business leaders had provided substantial monies to the Kilpatricks to convince the mayor to resign his office and plead guilty. On January 20, 2010, Judge Groner ruled that Kilpatrick pay the sum of $300,000 to the city of Detroit within 90 days.\n\n\n of Kilpatrick]]\n\nOn February 19, 2010, Kilpatrick missed a required restitution payment of $79,000. The court received only $14,000 on February 19 and then only another $21,175 on February 22. On February 23, Judge Groner approved a warrant for Kilpatrick and ruled in April that he had violated the terms of his probation. On May 25, 2010, Kilpatrick was sentenced to one and a half to five years with the  (with credit for 120 days previously served) for violation of probation, and was afterwards taken back into correctional custody. He was housed for fourteen days in the hospital unit of the state prisoner reception center. Kilpatrick was later housed in the .\n\nAfter he was indicted in federal court for additional crimes related to alleged misuse of his campaign funds, Kilpatrick lobbied for a transfer from the Oaks Correctional Facility. On July 11, 2010, he was transferred into the  (BOP). Kilpatrick was incarcerated in the  near . He was released from federal custody on April 6, 2011. During his final 118 days of state imprisonment, Kilpatrick resided in the Cotton Correctional Facility. Kilpatrick was released on parole on August 2, 2011. In August 2011 the court ordered Kilpatrick to pay for his incarceration costs.\n\n\nOn December 14, 2010, Kilpatrick was again indicted on new corruption charges, in what a federal prosecutor called a \"pattern of extortion, bribery and fraud\" by some of the city's most prominent officials. His father, Bernard Kilpatrick, was also indicted, as was contractor Bobby Ferguson; Kilpatrick's aide, Derrick Miller; and Detroit water department chief Victor Mercado. The original 38-charge indictment listed allegations of 13 fraudulent schemes in awarding contracts in the city's Department of Water and Sewerage, with pocketed kickbacks of nearly $1,000,000. He was arraigned on January 10, 2011, on charges in the 89-page indictment. Federal prosecuting attorneys proposed a trial date in January 2012, but defense attorneys asked for a trial date in the summer of 2012.\n\nOpening statements in the trial began on September 21, 2012. Prosecutors soon brought forth a large number of witnesses who gave damaging testimony. Mercado took a plea deal while the trial was in progress. On March 11, 2013, in spite of a vigorous defense that cost taxpayers more than a million dollars, Kilpatrick was found guilty by a jury on two dozen counts including those for racketeering, extortion, mail fraud, and tax evasion, among others. Shortly after conviction, speaking about Kilpatrick, Judge Nancy Edmunds ruled in favor of remand saying \"detention is required in his circumstance\".\n\nHe was sentenced to 28 years in prison on October 10, 2013. Kilpatrick,  Register #44678-039, was serving his sentence at , a low-security prison in . There is no parole in the federal prison system. However, with time off for good behavior, his earliest possible release date was August 1, 2037when he would be 67 years old.\n\nMercado pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, Bobby Ferguson was sentenced to 21 years in prison, Derrick Miller pleaded guilty to tax evasion and was sentenced to three years supervision, the first year in a halfway house. Bernard Kilpatrick was sentenced to 15 months in prison. Emma Bell received two years probation and was fined $330,000 in back taxes as part of a plea deal where she testified that she frequently handed Kilpatrick large amounts of cash skimmed from campaign accounts.\n\nFirst Independence Bank, used by Kilpatrick and Ferguson, was fined $250,000 for failing to follow anti-money-laundering regulations. 14 companies were suspended from bidding on contracts with the water department in the wake of the scandal. Inland Waters Pollution Control Inc. paid $4.5 million in the settlement of a lawsuit over their involvement with Kilpatrick, Ferguson and the Detroit Water Board. Lakeshore TolTest Corp. reached a $5 million settlement with the Water Board to avoid litigation.\n\nIn August 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld his convictions but ordered that the amount of restitution be recalculated. In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his appeal.\n\nIn June 2018 Kilpatrick began seeking a pardon from President . His application was opposed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for southeast Michigan. Restitution claims and other civil lawsuits accumulated claimed $10 million in debts, for which Kilpatrick is responsible. Kilpatrick has no assets to settle these claims.\n\n\nOn January 20, 2021, President  commuted Kilpatrick's sentence with less than 12 hours remaining before he was due to leave office as president. The White House statement on the commutation of Kilpatrick reads: \"Mr. Kilpatrick has served approximately 7 years in prison for his role in a racketeering and bribery scheme while he held public office. During his incarceration, Mr. Kilpatrick has taught public speaking classes and has led Bible Study groups with his fellow inmates.\"\n\nPresident Trump's commutation allowed Kilpatrick to gain release 20 years early, though it did not vacate his conviction. The commutation left in place the almost $4.8 million in restitution and the three-year probation. Kilpatrick will not be able to run for office in Michigan until 2033 as a felon is excluded from politics for 20 years after conviction under Michigan law.\n\n\nIn 2012, the  charged Kilpatrick and former city treasurer Jeffrey W. Beasley for having received $180,000 in travel, hotel rooms, and gifts from a company seeking investments from the city pension fund. Chauncey C. Mayfield and his company were also brought before administrative proceedings. The company received a $117 million investment in a  that it controlled. MayfieldGentry proceeded to misappropriate $3.1 million from the pension fund which was revealed during the influence peddling investigation. Mayfield pleaded guilty in 2013. The case was scheduled for June 2014.\n\nAccording to '''' (June 24, 2010), Kilpatrick, his father Bernard, and the Kilpatrick Civic Fund may have been important figures in the sludge hauling contract that saw city council president  (wife of Rep. ) and her chief of staff Sam Riddle convicted for conspiracy and bribery. \"Kilpatrick and his father also figured, but have not been charged, in evidence surrounding a bribery-tainted, $1.2 billion sewage sludge contract the Detroit City Council awarded to Synagro Technologies Inc. in 2007. According to court documents and people familiar with the case, former Synagro official James Rosendall made large contributions to the Kilpatrick Civic Fund and gave Kilpatrick free flights to Las Vegas and Mackinac Island. Rosendall also told investigators he made cash payments to Bernard N. Kilpatrick, who told Rosendall he got him access to City Hall, records show.\" Rosendall and a Synagro consultant Rayford Jackson were also convicted of bribery.\n\n\nKilpatrick co-wrote a memoir about his life and political experiences titled ''Surrendered: The Rise, Fall, & Revelation of Kwame Kilpatrick''. The book was originally scheduled for release on August 2, 2011, a date that would have just barely preceded his scheduled release from a Michigan prison. However, the publisher delayed the release to August 9, almost a week after Kilpatrick was paroled. Kilpatrick appeared at public events in Michigan and elsewhere to promote his book.\n\nThe public prosecutor in Wayne County, Michigan has asked the state courts to order the book's publisher, Tennessee-based Creative Publishing Consultants Inc., to remit Kilpatrick's share on the book's proceeds for payment toward Kilpatrick's criminal restitution and his cost of incarceration. On November 16, 2011, the publisher's attorney failed to appear at a hearing on the matter in Wayne County Circuit Court. A bench warrant was issued for the attorney, Jack Gritton, and was forwarded to authorities in Tennessee, where Gritton's practice is based.\n\n\nSince release, Kilpatrick has worked as an \"ordained minister, motivational speaker, consultant, and certified character coach\". In April 2023, Kilpatrick was a guest speaker at the \"Black Agenda Movement\" conference, organized by YouTuber Michelle R. Kulczyk (Meechi X).\n\nOn June 15, 2024, Kilpatrick endorsed  in the .\n\n\n*'''2005 Race for Mayor (Detroit)'''\n**Kwame Kilpatrick (D) (incumbent), 53%\n** (D), 47%\n*'''2005 Race for Mayor (Detroit) (Primary Election)'''\n** (D), 45%\n**Kwame Kilpatrick (D) (incumbent), 34%\n** (D), 12%\n** (D), 8%\n*'''2001 Race for Mayor (Detroit)'''\n**Kwame Kilpatrick (D), 54%\n** (D), 46%\n\n\nAs a politician, Kilpatrick was a member of the .\n\nKilpatrick was a member of the , a  anti-gun group with a stated goal of \"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.\" The Coalition was co-chaired by Mayor  of  and  of .

Orr had been picked to lead Jones Day's new Miami office before he resigned his partnership to move to Detroit. Noting his \"impressive depth of experience,\" legal industry publication ''Chambers and Partners'' listed Orr among the top bankruptcy lawyers in Washington as of 2013.\n\nWhile at Jones Day, Orr represented  in connection with its 2009 bankruptcy and restructuring. According to bankruptcy court records, Orr billed $700 an hour during the bankruptcy. The '''' described Orr as \"the lead attorney on convincing the court to allow Chrysler to abruptly close a quarter of its U.S. dealerships\".

The Nazis called themselves ‘revolutionists’ and opponents of the international Jewish capitalist conspiracy. This has nothing to do with left politics. My movement, the Socialist Equality Party, is seeking to build a genuine movement of the working class. We are above all internationalists.

The write-in campaign was accompanied by a redesign of the Socialist Equality Party's website, which would rehost articles written by both candidates for the ., Independent Political Report, 18 September 2008., Michigan Daily, 24 September 2008.\n\nReporting on a campaign speech by White at the University of Michigan, the student newspaper wrote, “White said he is running to provide a political alternative to Obama and McCain, both of whom support the bailout. ‘Both of them are preparing to issue a joint statement urging the passage of what would be the greatest theft of public assets in the history of the country, to bail out financial speculators at the direct expense of working people,’ he said. ‘We’re running in order to make the case for a socialist alternative. If the resources of the country have to be mobilized to avert a financial catastrophe, then the great financial institutions should be put under the public and democratic ownership of the working people.’”\n\nIn 2012, White ran as the SEP presidential candidate with vice-presidential candidate Phyllis Scherrer.

In an interview with , White explained, “For years social opposition has been channeled back into the Democratic Party, which has presented itself as a “people’s party,” pointing to role of the leaders of the 2003 anti-war protests, the Occupy Wall Street and the Sanders campaign. “There is no national solution for American workers or Greek workers, we’re confronting huge transnational corporations that can only be fought through the international unity of the working class.” \n\nSpeaking to the Legal Reader during 2016 campaign, White was asked to explain the difference between the Socialist Equality Party and those groups the SEP refers to as the “pseudo left.” White explained that the Socialist Equality Party traces its roots back to the political struggle by Leon Trotsky for revolutionary internationalism against Stalinist bureaucracy’s nationalist and reactionary program of “socialism in a single country.” After World War II, the orthodox Trotskyists, White said, had to fight and ultimately defeat political tendencies associated with Michel Pablo and Ernest Mandel, which tried to liquidate the Fourth International into the existing Stalinist, Social Democratic, bourgeois nationalist and trade union apparatuses.“So, we call them ‘pseudo-left’ not as an epithet but to describe those organizations that present themselves as sort of anti-establishment or even in some cases socialist, but whose politics are pro-war and articulate the interests of the top ten percent, that layer of the upper middle class that does have some real concerns over how wealth is being distributed at the top and is really concerned about, you know, getting its own cut of the spoils. But they’re not looking to overthrow capitalism.”\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Prior to election to public office, he spent his career as an educator, teaching government, political science, and psychology in the . His last teaching position was at , where he taught for about ten years.\n\n\nIn 1976, Fouts ran as a  for the Michigan state house of representatives in the 70th District. Fouts was elected to the Warren City Council in 1981, where he served for 26 years as a . During his tenure, he initiated several anti-tobacco proposals.\n\nIn 2007,  had reached the  as mayor of Warren and did not seek re-election. Fouts ran against City Clerk Richard Sulaka for the open seat and won 62% to 38%. In the 2007 campaign, finance reports show that Sulaka outspent Fouts $332,000 to $225,000. Sulaka described Fouts as a \"maverick\" and attributed his victory to voters seeking an alternative to the previous administration. The election also saw Warren citizens electing a new clerk, new treasurer, and a majority of new council members.\n\n\n\nHis enforcement of local building codes led to the demolition of dilapidated buildings and the promotion of neighborhood \"clean sweeps\" by city inspectors and was touted as a model for other mayors.\n\nIn response to the challenges facing the automotive industry, an industry which employs many Warren residents, he initiated a \"Buy American Products\" policy for automotive purchases by heads of city departments.\n\nIn 2009, Fouts tried to convince General Motors to relocate its headquarters from Detroit to Warren.\n\nHis 2011 re-election campaign was endorsed by the ''Detroit Free Press'' who said the campaign had become \"way too focused on legal battles over Fouts' age\" which became an issue when his opponents filed suit to remove him from the ballot because he had refused to place his age on the candidacy form. He won the lawsuit and the election with more than 80% of the vote against City Councilwoman Kathy Vogt.\n\nIn 2012, he acted to ban smoking within 100 feet of any city building without legislative approval, but the court said he did not have the authority and had the \"No Smoking\" signs removed. Fouts brought the measure back to the city council, after they had tabled it in September.\n\nIn July 2014, Fouts personally denied permission to establish an  \"Reason Booth\" at Warren City Hall, as a counterpoint to a \"Prayer Booth\" that was established in the city hall's atrium by a local  church in 2009. The resident denied permission, Douglas Marshall, filed a federal lawsuit against both the city and Fouts. Represented by the , , and , Marshall's lawsuit was based on the  rights to free speech and a violation of the . The defendants failed to respond to the lawsuit, and in 2015 the federal court ordered that the reason station \"be allowed to operate on terms not less favorable than the terms granted to the 'Prayer Station' currently allowed in the atrium space\" and entered a $100,000 judgment against the city and Fouts for costs, damages and attorney fees.\n\nIn 2014, Fouts sued to invalidate 2014 Proposal 1, a voter-approved referendum that eliminated the Michigan personal property tax for businesses (which applies to industrial machinery and office equipment) and replaced it with an Internet sales tax. Fouts alleged that the ballot wording was biased. The Michigan Court of Claims declined to invalidate the ballot initiative, and Fouts ultimately dropped an appeal.\n\nIn March 2016, Fouts claimed that he was asked by security at the  to refrain from showing excessive enthusiasm for , and that he was threatened with ejection.\n\nFouts won a third term in November 2015, carrying 85% of the vote.\n\nIn November 2016, Fouts accused Macomb County Executive  of a coverup of illegal dumping. In response, Hackel provided a series of audio recordings to the media, that he claimed to have received from unidentified sources, allegedly of Fouts making derogatory comments. Fouts claimed that the recordings were manufactured and manipulated. These led to calls for Fouts's resignation. In a post on , Fouts declared his intention to remain in office through to the end of his term in 2019; he would go on to be reelected to a fourth term later that year, with 57.5% of the vote.\n\nIn late 2017, amid the , Fouts and Warren Police Commissioner Jim Dwyer created a program to offer rewards to residents of the city who give confidential tips to police informing on suspected drug deals.\n\nIn April 2020, Fouts directed the Warren Police to not enforce the provision of 's executive order on COVID-19 banning commercial lawn services. Fouts stated the lack of lawn maintenance would lead to higher numbers of mosquitoes and rodents and be a health hazard and that it is an essential service.\n\nIn January 2023, Fouts filed paperwork to run for a fifth term as mayor in the November 2023 election, despite voters passing a charter amendment in 2020 establishing a three-term limit for the office of mayor. The city's election clerk approved his candidacy, and was promptly sued by the City Council. Fouts claimed to have been grandfathered in, having been elected to all four terms before the amendment passed; a Macomb County judge sided with Fouts in March. The decision was overturned by the  in April, and the clerk was ordered to disqualify Fouts.\n\n\nFouts rejoined the Democratic Party in 2024, and that April, he filed to run in the Democratic primary for Michigan's redrawn , challenging incumbent Representative . McFall defeated Fouts, 71% to 29%.\n\n\n\nFouts won his re-election to the City's Mayoral office over challenger Kelly Colegio. \n}}\n\n\n 9,649\n}}\n\n\n\nFouts won his re-election to the City's Mayoral office by an extremely large margin over challenger Karen Spranger. \n}}\n\n\n 8,407\n}}\n\n\n\nFouts won his re-election to the City's Mayoral office by an extremely large margin over challenger Kathy J.

Prior to her election to the position of Clerk, Byrum represented the  in the . She succeeded her mother, House  . She owns Byrum Hardware in , and lives in Onondaga with her husband Brad Delaney and their two children.\n\n\nByrum grew up in , a small rural town in southwestern Ingham County. She is the daughter of Jim Byrum, a former Lansing Community College trustee, and Dianne Byrum, a former State Representative. Byrum is a graduate of Leslie High School. She attended Lansing Community College from 1994 to 1997 before attending . Byrum earned a Bachelor of Science degree in  management in 1999. After working in agribusiness for a few years, she returned to MSU College of Law and graduated with her juris doctor in 2004.\n\n\nByrum served as the Representative for the 67th House District in the Michigan House of Representatives from 2007 to 2012. During her first term, Byrum was Chair of the Intergovernmental, Urban and Regional Affairs Committee and a vice-chair of the House Committee on Agriculture. During the 94th Legislature, she was also on the Commerce, Education and Health Policy committees and was caucus vice-chair. She was Chair of the House Committee on Insurance. During her last term in the Michigan House of Representatives Byrum was the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Redistricting and Elections.\n\n\nByrum is responsible for introducing the bill that later became Public Act 218 of 2008 which allows small distilleries to market and sell their distilled grain-based spirits onsite. Byrum worked closely with Kris Berglund, a Distinguished Professor of forestry and chemical engineering at Michigan State University.\n\n\nOn June 14, 2012, during a contentious debate over a controversial anti-abortion bill, Byrum and her colleague, Representative , found themselves banned from speaking on the House floor for saying \"vasectomy\" and \"vagina,\" respectively.  Byrum tried to introduce an amendment to the proposed bill that would ban men having vasectomies unless the procedure was needed to save their lives – a key clause of the anti-abortion bill. She was ruled out of order after protesting that she had not been allowed to speak on her proposal. Both Byrum and Brown were censured by House leadership and forbidden to speak on the floor.\n\nFollowing the incident on the House floor, playwright  staged a special reading of her play, '','' on the steps of the state Capitol Building.\n\n\nByrum has served as the Clerk of Ingham County since 2013. On November 8, 2016, she was re-elected to the position. On November 3, 2020, she was re-elected to a third term.\n\n\nThe County Clerk is elected for a four-year term and is responsible for keeping records of births, deaths, assumed names, co-partnerships, and issuing and filing marriage licenses.  In addition, the Clerk's office processes gun permits and notary bonds.  The Clerk also serves as the Clerk of the Board of Commissioners, the Board of Canvassers, the Gun Board, and is the Clerk of the Circuit Court.  The Clerk is also a member of the Plat Board and Election Commission. The Clerk also serves as an officiant for wedding ceremonies.\n\nOne of the more prominent responsibilities is the Chief Election Official in the county.  As such, the County Clerk administers all election functions required by law.  Part of those duties include the supervision of all national, state, and local elections and includes the training of all election workers in the county for those communities with a population of under ten thousand.  The Clerk is also responsible for the Administration of the Michigan Campaign Finance Reporting Act for those candidates that file for office at the local level.\n\n\nOn Saturday, March 22, 2014, following a U.S. District Court ruling that Michigan's ban on same sex marriage was unconstitutional, Byrum performed what has been reported as the first same sex marriage in the state of Michigan. At the time of their marriage, the couple, Glenna DeJong, 53, and Marsha Caspar, 51, had been together for 26 years. When asked why she opted to open her office to issue licenses, Byrum said, \"My biggest struggle on that day was -- I can open, yeah, my key will open the door, but how will I actually process those marriage licenses? I couldn't sleep with the thought that I might be standing in the way of loving couples joining together in marriage.\"\n\n\nFollowing the 2016 Presidential Election, Green Party candidate Jill Stein requested a recount of the votes cast in Michigan. On December 5, 2016, the Presidential Recount began in Ingham County. Byrum reportedly hired 75 election workers to recount ballots. On December 7, Byrum announced the recount was finished. Ingham County was the first county to complete their recount.\n\n\n\nReporting from February 2023 named Byrum as one of several potential Democratic candidates who was considering a run for Michigan's 7th Congressional District, which will be open with Rep. Elisa Slotkin announcing her run for U.S. Senate. Byrum confirmed that she was interested and exploring a potential Congressional run in March 2023.\n\nOn June 1, Bryum put out a video/written statement over Twitter saying she wasn't running for Congress and instead opted to run for re-election instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The legislation passed the House on July 28, 2014. She also advocated for ways to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's ability to identify and stop terrorists with western passports, authoring legislation in that would allow DHS to suspend a country's participation in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program if it fails to provide the U.S. with pertinent traveler information related to terror threats.

Representative Miller saw Representative Smith's no vote on the board and she \"didn't like the way that he voted.\" Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: \"Is this how you're going to vote; or, This is how you're going to vote?

Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote on the Medicare legislation.\n\nRepresentative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote. Representative Smith's recollection was that Representative Miller \"came up and said something like, I haven't been involved in this campaign before, but if you don't change your vote, I'll get involved, and I'll make sure Brad isn't elected.\"}}\n\n\nMiller is a signatory of 's , which commits her to oppose tax increases.\n\nMiller sat on the  and has praised President Obama for his stance on off-shore oil exploration.

Miller said that \"Today, the House passed legislation that provides the necessary statutory authorization that will protect the agency's mission by providing our officers and agents proper authorities to carry out their important work.\"\n\nMiller also introduced a bill, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act of 2015 which has been criticized for casting US citizens of Arab, Iranian, and Muslim descent as second-class citizens in their own country – a \"legislation that will effectively create two classes of Americans – Americans with Middle Eastern or Muslim background, and Americans without that background\".\n\nMiller was ranked as the 71st most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the  (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan) in the Bipartisan Index created by  and the  that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).\n\n\nThe bill  passed in the House on March 4, 2014. The bill delayed indefinitely some of the reforms to the deeply indebted . The primary issue what the premiums should be on home and business owners located in flood zones. Miller opposed the bill and argued that the state of Michigan should opt out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should. Miller suggested insurance premiums of being decided by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that \"too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater.\"\n\n\n\nMiller was elected  Supervisor in 1980, becoming the first woman and the youngest person ever to be elected to the position. In her first bid for federal office, Miller lost to 5-term incumbent Democrat  for .\n\n\nShe was the first woman ever elected to the positions of Macomb County Treasurer and Secretary of State.

She was also rumored to be considering running for the Republican nomination for , to succeed three-term Republican Gov. , who was term-limited. She ultimately passed on both races.\n\n\nAfter the , the  reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term  David Bonior. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the . In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in  to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior subsequently opted to run for the  rather than run for re-election to the USA House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary unopposed, and later in the general election in November she handily beat Democrat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982.

Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation.\"\n\nMiller spoke on behalf of Senator  and was a vocal supporter of Governor . She was a member of Gov. Palin's \"truth squad\" leading up to the 2008 presidential election.\n\n\n\nMiller was challenged by Democratic nominee , a Sterling Heights firefighter and paramedic. He is currently the chairman of the 10th District Democrats and was a delegate to the  and s. Miller won reelection November 3, 2010 with nearly 72% of the vote, beating Yanez, two minor party candidates, and a write-in.\n\n\n\nMiller's choice for chairman of Michigan's 10th congressional district Republican committee lost to her former assistant secretary of state, Stanley Grot, a local .

Miller said the corruption that occurred under Marrocco was pervasive and widespread and that people used the office's resources for personal use. In November 2017, Bucci was indicted on 18 felony counts including bribery, extortion, mail fraud, money laundering and embezzlement for his role in a decade-long conspiracy alleging a \"pay-to-play\" scheme under Marrocco. Bucci faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted On May 27, 2020, Marrocco was indicted on two counts of extortion and one count of attempted extortion for allegedly using Bucci and other county employees to force contractors and business people who wished to do business with the Public Works Department to buy tickets to his fundraisers.

He served as the representative of  from 1982 to 1990 and the  from 2002 to 2006. Between those terms, from 1990 to 2002, he served as senator of the 22nd district. He authored Michigan's Crime Victims Rights Act, which has served as the national model for . He also authored and passed two successful amendments to the Michigan Constitution (art. I, sec. 20 and art. I, sec. 24).\n\n\nVan Regenmorter attended . He was a businessman, prior to running for political office, he owned a furniture retail store and served as an analyst at . He also served as the  Commissioner.\n\n\nVan Regenmorter's political career started with his election into the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1982. He served as the representative of Ottawa County through 1990. Van Regenmorter served several terms in the  (1990-2002) before being elected to the  in 2002. VanRegenmorter announced that he would not seek election in 2006 for health reasons. He is most widely known for authoring Michigan's Crime Victims Rights Amendment and had been seen as a national leader on this issue.\n\nHe served and headed various committees during his time in office, including the chair of the Judiciary Committee for 16 years.Grand Rapids Press, The. \"William J. Van Regenmorter: Obituary.\" \nhttp://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/grandrapids/obituary.aspx?pid=158136483.\n Other committee positions include Corrections (M.V.C.), Economic Development & Energy, and House Oversight.Michigan Independent News and Information Service. Capitol Profiles 1987-1988: A \nDirectory of Michigan's Elected Officials in Lansing and Washington. Lansing: \nCapitol Publications, 1987. 76. Print.\n\n\nHis work included initiating several reforms in the criminal justice system, revisions of the juvenile code, changes in sentencing procedures for dangerous felons and enactment of community placement provisions. He stressed the need for improving the cost-efficiency of the state's own budget operations. Another major accomplishment was his work with State Representative Michael Nye in sponsoring and passing legislation to create the family division of Michigan's circuit court in the mid-1990's. The family division is a specialized court with jurisdiction over a wide range of family-related litigation including domestic relations, child abuse/neglect, and delinquency. The goal was to create a system of \"one family, one judge\" where a single judge would preside over all issues of a single family in the court system. \n\n\nHe died at age 73, after a battle with Parkinson's Disease. Flags across the state were lowered to half-mast in his honor.\n\n\nThe problem with attempting to collect scholarly research on former Michigan legislator, William Van Regenmorter, is that there is none. The only information to be found about the man is located in various Michigan government documents, obituaries, website biographies, and his collection of papers in Calvin College's Heritage Hall. \n\t\nThere is little information written about the life of Van Regenmorter prior to his political career. The biographical sketches published by the state of Michigan contain what little is written about his life before his election to the State House of Representatives in 1982. These include The Michigan Manual of 1983–84, 1987–88, and 2001–2002. All of which state his date of birth, January 29, 1939, in Jamestown Michigan. His obituary in the Grand Rapids Press also contains this information along with the names of his parents, William Sr. and Zora (Van Oss) Van Regenmorter. Following his birth no other information is provided until mention of his schooling, which took place at Calvin College. There is another lapse in biographical information between his time at Calvin College and his professional career. Capitol Profiles states that William was a financial analyst for Dun & Bradstreet and at one point he was the owner of a retail furniture store. It is documented in the 1983-84 edition of the Michigan Manual that Van Regenmorter was a member of the Christian Reformed Church. \n\t\nThe political career of Van Regenmorter is the most detailed portion of his life. In comparing the three manuals one can see some subtle changes throughout the years. The 1983-84 edition coincided with Van Regenmorter's second year in office and states that before the 1982 election he served as Ottawa County Commissioner. In his first term as Representative of Michigan's 55th district he served on the National Association of Criminal Justice Planners. His biographical sketch in the 1987-88 edition showed that Van Regenmorter was the director of the Michigan Victim Alliance as well as the Chairman of Michigan's Republican Caucus. The 2001-2002 edition of the Michigan Manual contains the info of his final term as a Michigan senator. At this time he served on both the Gaming and Casino Oversight committee and the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules. This edition also recognized that he was the author of the Crime Victim's Rights Act and two successful amendments to the Michigan Constitution.\n\t\nThe majority of the writing found on William Van Regenmorter is concerned with his work with crime victims' rights, specifically his authorship of the William Van Regenmorter Crime Victims Rights Act and the subsequent amendment to Michigan's constitution. In a tribute following Van Regenmorter's death the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) stated that his influence over the development of victims' rights policy has spread across the country, and that the Michigan Victims Bill of Rights has served as the model in drafting Arizona's law, that in turn, served as the model for many other states' amendments.Office for Victims of Crime. \"Tribute to William Van Regenmorter.\" \nhttp://www.ovc.gov/news/William_VanRegenmorter.html.\n A copy of the act and amendment can be found on Michigan Legislature's digital government publications website.\n\t\nThe policy reforms and amendments were so influential that in 1989 Pepperdine Law Review conducted a study of the history of Michigan's reforms on crime victims' rights, focusing on the Crime Victims Rights Act and Van Regenmorter's authorship. Van Regenmorter, in an article published by the Grand Rapids Business Journal, described how the federal Crime Victims Rights Act was approved using language from Michigan's constitutional amendment.\n\t\nBy far the most informative piece concerning William Van Regenmorter, other than his own personal collection, is the University of Akron's Oral History interview. In the 2003 interview Van Regenmorter stated his reasons of interest in crime victims' rights. The interview discusses the context in which Van Regenmorter started his policy making concerning victims' rights, the challenges involved, successes, failures, and future plans concerning the same subject.\n\t\nThroughout his years as both a representative and senator in the Michigan state legislature Van Regenmorter has won a considerable number of awards. In an online publication of the Michigan Manual of 2003-04 it is stated that William was the recipient of Michigan \"Legislator of the Year\" eleven times and the \"National Legislator of the Year\" by the National Victim Center. Van Regenmorter's obituary stated that his death was on June 18, 2012, after having struggled with Parkinson's Disease for nine years. The Office of Victims of Crime's tribute to Van Regenmorter described how on June 20, 2012, Governor  ordered that flags were to be lowered at half-staff in honor of Senator Van Regenmorter.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A member of the , Lucido previously served in the  from 2019 to 2020 (as the Senate Majority ), and in the  from 2015 to 2019.\n\n\nLucido's political career started with running to succeed the term-limited Pete Lund to represent the  in the . Lucido's opponent for the Republican nomination was then- Clerk Stan Grot. The race was called the most expensive race for a state House seat in Michigan history. The two candidates spent approximately $350,000 combined with Lucido investing $150,000 of his own money. There were dirty campaign tactics alleged by both sides, with both candidates falsely claiming endorsements from conservative groups. The race's tactics were called a \"new low for Macomb politics.\" Lucido would eventual prevail over Grot by just 103 votes out of the more than 9,400 cast. Lucido would win the general election in the heavily Republican district, defeating Democratic nominee Robert Murphy, taking 70 percent of the vote.\n\nDuring his 2016 re-election bid, Lucido's opponent Democratic nominee Diane Young filed a complaint with federal and state authorities alleging that Lucido failed to comply with transparency requirements for financial advisors and that he had committed possible campaign finance violations. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and the  both confirmed separate investigations but no official actions were taken against Lucido. Despite the allegations, Lucido was re-elected with 71 percent of the vote.\n\nLucido decided not to seek a third term in the state House, opting instead to run for the state Senate, seeking the  seat that became vacant by term-limited Republican incumbent . Lucido's only competition for the GOP nominating was former three-term state Rep. . Lucido decisively defeated Goike, taking 72 percent of the vote. Lucido defeated Democratic nominee Paul Francis, taking approximately 62 percent of the vote. Following his election to the State Senate, Lucido was elected majority whip by the Republican Caucus for the 2019-20 legislative session.\n\n\nAfter a year-long investigation by the Michigan State Police, FBI and the office of the Michigan Attorney General, then-Macomb County Prosecutor  was charged with 10 felonies in Macomb County Circuit Court related to public corruption, including embezzlement. Smith announced his resignation on March 30, 2020, in what was later revealed to be a condition plea negotiations between Smith and federal prosecutors in a separate case.\n\nSmith's resignation threw the race for Macomb County Prosecutor into flux as no candidate had filed to run in the race and Michigan's April 21 deadline for candidates to file to seek a partisan office was just 22 days away at the time of Smith's resignation. Lucido announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination just hours after Smith's resignation was announced. Lucido won the GOP nomination by a wide margin, defeating Richard John Goodman, who served in various roles in Macomb's prosecutor's office for almost for 30 years. His opponent was Democratic nominee Mary Chrzanowski, who had spent 24 years as a circuit court judge in Macomb County. Lucido again outraised his opponent by a massive margin, raising $377,000 to Chrzanowski's $118,000. Lucido criticized Chrzanowski for refusing to debate him with Chrzanowski saying she wouldn't agree to the debate because she said Lucido wanted to choose the debate's moderator saying \"...I understood this to mean if Mr. Lucido doesn't get to make the rules, he doesn't want to debate me. In an act of desperation, Mr Lucido is again making up false accusations about me.\"\n\nLucido defeated Chrzanowski in the general election with approximately 53 percent of the vote, becoming the first Republican elected to the office since 1944.\n\n\nLucido has been accused of sexual harassment by four different women: journalist Allison Donahue, State Senator , lobbyist Melissa Osborn, and an unnamed employee at his Macomb County government office, where he is Macomb County Prosecutor. He has also been accused of inappropriate touching by Ingham County Judge Lisa McCormick.\n\nIn January 2020, Lucido attracted controversy for telling Allison Donahue, a 22-year-old female reporter for the '''', that a visiting group of teenage boys from  could \"have a lot of fun\" with her if she were to \"hang around\" with them. The comment was widely interpreted as an instance of , prompting the Senate Business Office of the State of Michigan to open a sexual harassment investigation against Lucido. The controversy was covered in national and international outlets like '''', '''', and the ''''. Lucido initially agreed that he had made these remarks, apologizing for them but asserting that they were not intended to be disparaging, but later reversed his agreement and alleged that he had been misquoted.\n\nMcMorrow stated that Lucido touched her lower back and upper buttocks in November 2018, shortly after she was elected to the state senate, and made comments during a training session that suggested she won her election because of her appearance. Osborn said she was handing out name badges at a lunch for legislators when she felt Lucido's hand on her \"lower back/upper butt.\" She stated that Lucido held his hand there for a long time while complimenting her on her appearance and how the plaid dress she was wearing looked on her. His hand \"was placed too low and it was uncomfortable and he just talked about my appearance for an extended period of time, a couple of minutes,\" Osborn said on \"Detroit Today\" on . Osborn said, \"He was looking me up and down and it was very uncomfortable and demeaning.\" Osborn stated she decided to come forward because her experience was very similar to that of McMorrow's.\n\nThe State Senate investigated the sexual harassment allegations against Lucido. The investigation concluded that Lucido's comments were inappropriate, and as a result Lucido was removed from his committee chairmanship.\n\nLater, Lucido faced renewed controversy over a photo, posted to his own campaign's Facebook page, that shows him with his hand on a woman's behind. Musician Ralphe Armstrong's Facebook page also shared the photo, with a post that said Armstrong and his daughter appeared in the photo with Lucido. Shortly after the photo appeared on Lucido's page, the group Macomb Accountability Project, which opposed Lucido's election, wrote on its Facebook page: \"You’d think someone with 4 sexual harassment complaints would watch their hands.\"\n\n\nLucido is a licensed attorney and he founded the law firm Lucido & Manzella, P.C.

After graduating from there in 1982, he enrolled at  (and was also class president there three times), graduating in 1986 with a B.A. in political science.\n\n\n\n\nBernero served as a legislative aide and an  Commissioner.\n\n\nBernero ran for and won a seat in the  in 2000, serving one term before being elected to the  in 2002.\n\n\nBernero was elected to the Michigan Senate on November 5, 2002, and served there until his election as mayor three years later.\n\nWhile he was a state senator, Bernero appeared in the documentary ''Fired!'' (2006) by . The film chronicles the experiences of individuals who have been fired from their jobs. In it, Bernero was interviewed about his efforts to pass Michigan Senate Bill 381 of 2005 (\"Employee Privacy Protection Act\"), which would make it illegal for Michigan employers to fire workers for engaging in otherwise legal conduct during their off-work hours.\n\n\n\n\nBernero was elected Mayor of Lansing on November 8, 2005, after defeating incumbent mayor Tony Benavides.\n\nBernero was re-elected as mayor of Lansing in November 2009, winning against opponent Carol Wood.\n\nBernero was elected for his third term as mayor of Lansing in November 2013, winning against opponent Harold Leeman.\n\nDuring Bernero's tenure, Lansing received more than $2 billion in new private investments that created or retained more than 12,500 jobs. During potential revenue losses and rising costs, Bernero helped to eliminate more than $80 million in city budget deficits.\n\nHis tenure as mayor was not without some criticism, as several political adversaries circulated a petition to have him recalled as mayor.  The petition ultimately failed to collect enough signatures to be placed on the ballot.\n\nBernero announced he would not run for reelection in 2017 to be with his aging father.\n\n\n\nBernero officially announced his intention to run for Governor of Michigan on February 8, 2010. On August 3, 2010, Bernero defeated primary challenger  by 90,326 votes or nearly 20 percentage points. In the general election. Bernero lost to Republican candidate Snyder, garnering 39.9% of the vote to Snyder's 58.11%.\n\nDuring the gubernatorial election, Bernero was a frequent guest on cable news shows, where he was labeled the \"Angry Mayor\" for his passionate advocacy of his positions. The Lansing Brewing Company subsequently named one of its beers, ''Angry Mayor IPA'', after Bernero.\n\n\nAfter much speculation throughout 2020, Bernero officially announced his intention to run for the mayor of Lansing in January 2021. Bernero campaigned and continued to fundraise throughout February and early March when harassment and non-consensual touching claims by two women came forward. Bernero issued denials in interviews on radio and television, brushing off the allegations as \"character assassination\", alleging that \"powerful forces that do not want to see me return\". Bernero abruptly left the campaign trail with an announcement on Facebook on Sunday April 18, 2021, one day before new allegations from multiple women, including a former staffer, were published.\n\n\nMultiple women came forward about sexual harassment and unwanted touching, starting in 2004 when Bernero was serving in the Michigan Legislature, in 2010, 2013, and 2014  as Mayor of Lansing, with accounts of unsolicited phone calls, groping, and propositions for threesomes.\n\nIn June 2021, a former staffer, Elizabeth Hart, whose claims include she fled Michigan to escape Bernero's influence ruined her career, sued him in civil court for damages stemming from his sexual harassment and assault. The lawsuit claimed Bernero grabbed and tugged at her hair, stroked her shoulders and neck, even touching her knee while putting his finger to his lips, and twice touching the staffer's exposed feet, and claiming he \"had a foot fetish\" and the Plaintiff had \"beautiful feet\"  PDF|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/512749577/Cc-Summons-and-Complaint-Complaint-Filed-with-Fee-21-000422-No-c30-No-Personal-Injury|access-date=2021-10-22|website=Scribd|language=en}} and pressured her \"to drink alcohol he kept in his desk\".\n\nBernero's lawyers argued that the statute of limitations had passed and filed a motion to block an audio recording of conversation between Bernero, campaign manager Elena Greer, and Lansing City Councilmember Kathie Dunbar, from being used as evidence, in which Bernero called Hart a \"little girl\" and that there was \"no question\" he had been \"inappropriate\" with her, and speculates on whether \"she enjoyed it\", but that he \"owes an apology\" to Hart for what she had to \"endure\" and to all the women he has \"hurt\". Counsel for Bernero claimed in court filings that the recording was \"obtained illegally\".\n\nOn October 12, 2021, the case officially closed after a three line apology from Bernero and a $4,500 settlement. Counsel for Bernero said the outcome \"pleased everyone\". In an October 15, 2021 statement, Hart called the agreed settlement \"a form of justice\" and that during the \"extremely stressful\" lawsuit, she was \"petitioned to submit to unnecessary and violating exercises, such as full physical exams and a complete listing of her sexual history, that had no relevance to her degrading experiences with Bernero\", and called for a reexamination of sexual assault definitions in Michigan.\n\n\nIn 2004, Bernero (as a state senator), Rep. Michael Murphy, and Rep.  were jointly awarded the Ray of Light PRISM Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community.\n\nHe was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from his alma mater Adrian College in 2008.\n\n\nBernero is married to Teri (née Johnston); they met when both were attending Adrian College.

A member of the , she previously served as the  from 1999 to 2003 and as the 47th  from 2003 to 2011, as the first woman to hold each office.\n\nBorn in , , Granholm moved to  at age four. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the  in 1984 and a Juris Doctor degree from  in 1987. She then clerked for Judge  of the , became an assistant  for the  in 1991, and was appointed to the   in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Granholm ran for attorney general of Michigan, defeating Republican nominee . She ran for governor of Michigan  and was elected the state's first . She was re-elected .\n\nGranholm was a member of  for  before he  in 2009. After leaving public office, Granholm took a position at the UC Berkeley and, with her husband Daniel Mulhern, wrote ''A Governor's Story: The Fight for Jobs and America's Future'', released in 2011. She became host of ''''. In 2017, she was hired as a  political contributor.\n\nAfter President-elect  announced his intention to nominate Granholm to head the  in 2020, she was confirmed by the  in 2021.\n\n\nGranholm was born in , , to Shirley Alfreda (née Dowden) and Victor Ivar Granholm, both bank tellers. Granholm's maternal grandparents came from  and , respectively. Her paternal grandfather was Hugo \"Anders\" Granholm, who immigrated to , Canada, in the late 1920s from , Sweden, where his father was the mayor. The former Minister for Enterprise and Energy and former , , lives in Robertsfors, and when the two met in Sweden, the media revealed that Olofsson's husband is a relative of Granholm. Her paternal grandmother was Judith Olivia Henriette (Solstad) Granholm, an emigrant from  in . She came with the ship  from Oslo to Halifax, and from there she took the railway to , where her uncles and several others had established a small logging village.\n\nGranholm's family immigrated to  when she was four years old. She grew up in , , and . Granholm attended Ida Price Junior High and  before graduating from  in 1977 and won the Miss San Carlos . As a young adult, she attempted to launch a  acting career but abandoned her efforts at age 21.''Detroit Free Press'', 11/6/02, \"She's the Boss – Granholm wins a place in history as Michigan elects the state's first female governor\". In 1978, she appeared on '''', and held jobs as a  at  and in  at the '''' and was the first female tour guide at  in , piloting boats with 25 tourists aboard.\n\nIn 1980, at age 21, she became a  , and worked for 's campaign for  as an Independent in the . She then enrolled at the , the first person in her family to attend college. She was elected to  and graduated in 1984 with a  in  and . During a year in France, she helped to smuggle clothes and medical supplies to  and became involved in the . She then earned a  degree at , also with honors, in 1987. At , Granholm served as  of the ''''.\n\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, Granholm clerked for Judge , a senior judge on the , from 1987 to 1988. She also worked for the . After working as an attorney in the  executive office from 1989 to 1991, Granholm became an assistant  for the  in 1991. She helped to prosecute drug dealers, gang members and child pornographers, sued the state and fought against credit card fraud. Of the 154 people Granholm tried, 151 were convicted. In 1995, she was appointed as Corporation Counsel for Wayne County, the youngest person to hold the position. Granholm defended the county against lawsuits, sued the state over road taxes, and fought to uphold environmental laws.\n\n\n\n\nThirty-seven-year Democratic   chose not to run for a 10th term in  and Granholm entered the race to succeed him. Unopposed for the Democratic nomination, she faced Republican , the 1994 nominee and former U.S. attorney for the , in the general election. The campaign began as a relatively friendly one, with both agreeing that they wanted to expand the Internet Crimes Unit, start neighborhood-based crime-fighting programmes and continue working as a consumer advocate, as Kelley had done.\n\nHowever, the race turned bitter in mid-September, when Smietanka ran television ads that called Granholm an \"inexperienced\" and \"dangerous\" liberal. He also tried to link Granholm to Democratic gubernatorial nominee 's crime plan, which called for greater emphasis on rehabilitation for non-violent criminals and shortening their prison terms. Granholm, who had disavowed Fieger's crime plan the day it was released, said the claim was \"a lie, just a lie\" and that as attorney general, \"you are the person who is to protect the consumer from deceitful ads.\" Asked what separated her from Smietanka, Granholm replied, \"Besides honesty?\" Kelley also came to Granholm's defense, starring in an advertisement where he called Smietanka's ads \"garbage\" and a \"con\" and accused him of running a \"dishonest campaign\". For his part, Smietanka was angered by Democratic advertisements that referred to late child support payments he had made and claimed that he had lied about how much of his own money he donated to his campaign.\n\nAfter a close race, with polls showing the two candidates with virtually identical votes, Granholm defeated Smietanka by 1,557,310 votes (52.09%) to 1,432,604 (47.91%). After Granholm was elected governor in 2002, arguments arose between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor  about who was most responsible for Granholm's meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force him out of the 1998 race in favor of G. Scott Romney, for dredging up the issue of his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney at the Republican convention. Engler countered that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.\n\n\nGranholm was sworn into office on January 1, 1999, becoming the first female attorney general of Michigan. She served a single term, from 1999 to 2003. In office, she continued Kelley's work on protecting citizens and consumers' rights and established Michigan's first High Tech Crime Unit, appointing  as its first chief.\n\nIn April 1999, Granholm announced a lawsuit against RVP Development, builders of the , alleging that poor construction of the course had led to illegal discharges of sediment into Lake Michigan from erosion following heavy storms in 1998, which had \"turned a ravine into a ravaged gorge\". Development company President Richard Postma refused to pay the $425,000 of state fines, saying he had made moves to stop the erosion and accused Granholm of trying to make him \"a poster child for her campaign of the future\". Granholm responded that his \"perception of the political landscape in Michigan is as poor as his ability to construct a golf landscape\". After years of negotiations and legal wrangling, the lawsuit was settled in August 2003, with RVP Development agreeing to pay a $125,000 fine.\n\nDuring her tenure as Attorney General, Granholm became a harsh critic of the annual tradition at  called the . Through her efforts, the event was essentially cancelled by April 2000 never to emerge again. In July 2000, Granholm's office settled with  after the retailer made numerous pricing and scanning errors in stores in Michigan. The issue came to the attention of the attorney general's office after a \"repeat and progressively worse error rate\" that saw 33% of items sold in December 1999 being sold for more at the register than they were listed for on the shelves. J.C. Penney paid a fine and agreed to designate \"pricing associates\" to monitor for errors in pricing.\n\nAfter the , Granholm directed state agencies to work with lawmakers in keeping the fight against terrorism within the powers of the state. She also imposed a regulation on gasoline dealers to keep them from raising prices dramatically, something which occurred sporadically across Michigan immediately following the attacks. In February 2002, Granholm announced that her office was joining with the  Michigan State Office to help consumers fight calls from telemarketers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2002 election, incumbent Republican governor  was term-limited and not able to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler's , . Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former  and governor  and U.S. Representative and former  . Blanchard had been defeated for reelection by Engler in 1990 and Bonior had resigned as Democratic whip to run for governor, his House district having been redrawn to make it all but unwinnable for him.\n\nGranholm, seen by many as a \"fresh face\" after the 12-year Engler administration, raised more money than Blanchard and Bonior and consistently led them in polls by large margins. Her campaign led to increased turnout among women and she comfortably won the Democratic primary with 499,129 votes (47.69%) to Bonior's 292,958 (27.99%) and Blanchard's 254,586 (24.32%).\n\nGranholm was the heavy favorite in the general election, boasting strong support from working women, African-Americans and voters under 30 years of age. She campaigned on her record on crime and was seen as more charismatic than Posthumus. Despite the  being a good year for Republicans nationwide, who gained control of  and increased their hold on , Granholm defeated Posthumus by 1,633,796 votes (51.42%) to 1,506,104 (47.40%).\n\n\n ,  ,  , Granholm and   (c. 2004).]]\nGranholm was sworn in as the 47th governor of the state of Michigan on January 1, 2003. Upon her inauguration, in addition to becoming the state's first female governor, she also became its third governor who was not a  and its fourth who was not born within the United States. The earlier two non-natural-born citizens were , who was born in England and was the 26th governor from 1905 to 1911; and , who was also born in Canada and was the 42nd governor from 1961 to 1963. , who was born in Mexico and was the 27th governor from 1963 to 1969, was a natural-born citizen by virtue of his parents' U.S. citizenship at the time of his birth.\n\nGranholm emphasized Michigan's need to attract young people and businesses via the . As governor, she was a member of the , chairing its Health and Human Services Committee and co‑chairing its Health Care Task Force. She is also a former chair of the . She lived in the official , located near the Capitol Building.\n\nDuring Granholm's first year in office, she made a significant number of budget cuts to deal with a $1.7billion deficit (about two percent of the annual state budget). She was upset by proposals to cut state funding to social welfare programs, such as  shelters and  agencies.\n\nGranholm has been a proponent of  since the first year of her term. In her first State of the State Address in 2003, Granholm announced Project Great Start to focus on reforming education for children from birth to age five. Project Great Start has coordinated public and private efforts to encourage educating new parents and encouraging parents to read to their children.\n\n\nGranholm emphasized post-secondary education for Michiganders following the decline in Michigan manufacturing jobs, many of which did not require a college degree. In 2004 she asked Lieutenant Governor  to lead the Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. Many of the commission's recommendations were enacted into law during Granholm's tenure as governor, e.g. increasing high school graduation standards (The Michigan Merit Curriculum) so that every Michigan high school student takes a college preparatory curriculum, which includes four years of math and English/language arts and three years of science and social studies, beginning with students who entered high school in the fall of 2006.\n\nAt an awards ceremony on October 28, 2004, Granholm was inducted into the \"\". She has also been the recipient of the Michigan  1999 \"Outstanding Young Michiganders\" and the  \"Woman of the Year\" awards.\n\nDuring the , Granholm campaigned hard for Democratic nominee  after early polls showed President  with a narrow lead. She cited the economy as the main concern for Michiganders, not the  or the , which meant that with \"the deficit larger; the Dow dropping; unemployment claims up, hitting an all-time high; General Motors profits below expectations, with health claims crippling profits; flu vaccine in short supply; oil prices rising\" her state was badly hit.\n\nIn February 2005, Michigan's Republican-dominated legislature refused to vote on Granholm's proposed state budget, citing concerns over cuts to state funding for higher education. In the previous years of Granholm's term, many cuts to higher education had been demanded and voted in the legislature in order to balance the state budget. The year before, Republican leaders had called Granholm a \"do‑nothing governor\", claiming that she failed to lead, while Democrats accused legislative Republicans of being obstructionist. In January 2005, Granholm presented an early budget proposal, demanded immediate response from the Legislature, and held a press conference outlining the highlights of the proposed budget. After refusing to consider, debate, or vote on the proposed budget, Republicans stated they would prefer that the legislature have more involvement in the formation of the state budget.\n\nMichigan's economy had been losing jobs since 2000, largely owing to the decline in the American manufacturing sector. Granholm supported diversification of Michigan's economy away from its historical reliance on automotive manufacturing. She pushed through a $2billion  to attract jobs to Michigan in the life sciences, alternative energy, advanced manufacturing, and homeland security sectors.\n\n\n\nGranholm ran for a second term in the . Her opponent was  businessman and politician .\n\nBoth the Granholm campaign and the  put out television commercials produced by  focusing on her efforts to revive Michigan's economy and accusing DeVos of cutting Michigan jobs while he was head of what was then called . Granholm won re-election, defeating DeVos. The election results were 56 percent for Granholm, 42 percent for DeVos, and a little over one percent for minor-party candidates , , and . Granholm's share of the vote was 4.9 percent higher than in her first gubernatorial election in 2002. Granholm's campaign was managed by .\n\n\n\n\nThe  saw a return to power by the Democrats in the  and the retention of Republican control over the . The partisan division of power in Michigan's state government led to a showdown between Granholm and lawmakers over the  2008 state budget that resulted in a four-hour shutdown of nonessential state services in the early morning of October 1, 2007, until a budget was passed and signed. The budget cut services, froze state spending in areas such as the arts, increased the state income tax, and created a new set of service taxes on a variety of businesses, e.g. ski lifts and  and  companies, to address a state budget shortfall. As a result of the controversial budget, some taxpayer and business advocates called for a recall campaign against Granholm and lawmakers who voted for the tax increases.\n\nThe budget crisis eventually led  to downgrade Michigan's  from AA to AA−. Additionally, the crisis contributed to sinking approval ratings for Granholm, which went from 43 percent in August 2007 to a low of 32 percent in December 2007. She had one of the lowest approval ratings for any governor in the United States.\n\nIn 2007 Granholm proposed and signed into law the No Worker Left Behind Act to provide two years of free training or  for unemployed and displaced workers. Since its launch in August 2007, more than 130,000 people have enrolled in retraining. The program caps tuition assistance at $5000 per year for two years, or $10,000 per person, and covers retraining in high-demand occupations and emerging industries.\n\nThe Department of Energy, Labor, and Economic Growth reported back in October 2009 that 62,206 people had enrolled and that of the 34,355 who had completed training, 72% had found work or retained their positions and a further 18,000 were still in long-term or short-term training. 16% of all enrollees had withdrawn or failed to complete the training. As of July 2010, more than two years after the program was launched, 65,536 people were in training or involved in on-the-job training. Dropouts had been reduced to 13.1% of enrollments.\n\nGranholm delivered her sixth State of the State address on January 29, 2008. The speech focused mainly on creating jobs in Michigan through bringing  companies to Michigan. Through passing a , which would require that ten percent of Michigan's energy would come from renewable sources by 2015 and twenty-five percent by 2025, Granholm expected the alternative energy industry to emerge in Michigan. Since the passage of the standard, Mariah Power, Global Wind Systems, Cascade Swift Turbine, Great Lakes Turbine, and 38 other companies have announced new projects in Michigan. The solar and wind power industries now provide more than ten thousand jobs in Michigan.\n\nGranholm also called in the speech for an incentive package to offer tax breaks to filmmakers who shoot in Michigan and use local crews in production. A package of bills offering film industry incentives was approved by both houses of the  and signed into law by Granholm on April 7, 2008.\n\n's  during the second day of the  in .]]\nPartly because of pressure from Granholm,  was moved up to January 15, leading the  to strip the  of its delegates (Michigan historically had held its  on February 9). Granholm has been named by some as a possible candidate for . She was the policy chair of the .\n\nOn April 29, 2008, Granholm had emergency surgery to fix a health issue that stemmed from a 1993 accident. Because of the surgery, Granholm had to postpone a trip to  and . She finally made the journey in November 2008 and signed a  partnership agreement with the Israeli government. In addition, she delivered the keynote address at an automotive event organized by the  and the .\n\nIn response to a May 14, 2008 resolution by the  that Granholm remove Detroit Mayor  from office because of eight (later ten)  counts against him, Granholm began an inquiry that culminated in a removal hearing on September 3, 2008. On September 3, Granholm outlined the legal basis for the hearings, arguments were made, and three witnesses were called. On the morning of September 4, Kilpatrick agreed to two plea deals in which he pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and  one count of assaulting and obstructing a police officer in two separate cases. Both deals required his resignation. When the hearing reconvened later that day, Granholm said the hearing would be adjourned until September 22 as a result of the plea deals, and if Kilpatrick's resignation became effective before then the hearing would be cancelled.\n\nIn September 2008, Governor Granholm undertook the role of  vice presidential nominee  in a series of practice debates with  vice presidential nominee .\n\nWith the election of  as president, Granholm joined his economic advisory team, having had extensive experience running the Michigan economy, and there was speculation that she might join the Obama administration. On May 13, 2009, the  reported that President Obama was considering Granholm, among others, for possible appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Eventually Obama chose .\n\nIn 2010, Granholm was barred from seeking re-election due to Michigan's term limits law. Her governorship ended on January 1, 2011, when  , who won the 2010 election, was sworn in.\n\n\n 2019]]\nGranholm is a distinguished adjunct professor of law and public policy at the UC Berkeley  and . In the Autumn of 2011, she taught a graduate course entitled \"Governing in Tough Times\". She is also a senior research fellow at the Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute (BECI).

Leonard planned to embody \"principled, conservative leadership in the State House\" and on bringing his experience as a former prosecutor to stand up for the citizens of Michigan. Leonard received some prominent endorsements in the primary, including Senator , Clinton County Sheriff Wayne Kangas, and the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce. He narrowly won the Republican primary against  farmer Kevin Kirk by 204 votes. Leonard went on to win the  with 56.6% of the vote and assumed office in January 2013.\n\nLeonard was re-elected to his seat twice, defeating Josh Derke by over 20% in  and almost 30% in .\n\n\nIn 2012, Leonard left the attorney general's office to serve as state representative. During his first term in office, Leonard was elected to the House Leadership team as Majority Caucus Vice-chair. After serving as the ranking vice-chair of the Insurance Committee, Leonard was selected as Chair of the House Insurance Committee in his second term. Leonard was also chosen by his Republican colleagues in 2014 to serve as second-in-line in House leadership as the , a position which allowed him to preside over the House as Speaker during the absence of the Speaker of the House.\n\nIn September 2013, Leonard was selected as one of the 's \"10 under 40\" rising conservative leaders from across the country.\n\nLeonard is a Concealed Pistol License (CPL) holder and a Lifetime member of the  (NRA). He has maintained an \"A+\" rating with the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners (\"MCRGO\"-PAC) and an \"A\" rating from the .

He is also the former chairman of the DeWitt Public Safety Committee and an active member of the  . Leonard and his wife Jenell, who serves as the Director of the Michigan Film and Digital Media Office, live in  with their daughter, Hannah.\n\n\nIn November 2016, Leonard was selected by the House Republican Caucus to serve as , succeeding term-limited Speaker .  In January 2017, Leonard was formally elected Speaker of the House by a unanimous bipartisan vote of the entire Michigan House of Representatives. Leonard was the 2018 Republican nominee for . He was  by Democrat .\n\n\nImmediately after securing support among his Republican colleagues to be the next Speaker of the House, Leonard laid out three top priorities for his final term in the Legislature. His three priorities were mental health reform, expanding skilled trades education in Michigan schools, and reforming the state's underwater teacher pension fund.\n\n\nUpset with Michigan State University's handling of the , Leonard became the first public official to call for the resignation of then-MSU President .  Leonard faced immediate backlash for the decision from political opponents.  However, after another month and a half of embarrassing information becoming public, the full state House voted 96–11 in favor of a resolution demanding the president's resignation.  Simon resigned hours later.\n\nLeonard then called for the school's board of trustees to resign, allowing the governor to appoint replacements.  Inaction on forcing changes from President Simon and controversial and dismissive statements toward the victims of abuse from members of the Board drove the decision.\n\nCiting frustration from the victims at the lack of disclosure from Michigan State University and a need to find points of failure to inform the policy-making process, Leonard directed two of his committee chairs to launch a legislative inquiry into the situation.  In January 2018, those committee chairs requested several previously unavailable records from the school.  If the university refused, the committees threatened to utilize subpoena powers to compel the university to cooperate.\n\nThat inquiry led to thousands of pages of records being turned over to the Legislature. Those records revealed new, previously undiscovered criminal activity the Legislature turned over to the attorney general.\n\n\nAs the chairman of the House Insurance Committee, Leonard focused on reforming auto insurance to reduce rates for drivers and reforming the state's mental health system. Specifically, he led an effort to reform a state program, known as Kevin's Law, which allowed concerned family members to get critical help for those suffering from mental illness before a crime was committed.\n\nLeonard began his legal career as a clerk for Genesee County's chief probate judge, Jennie Barkey. Judge Barkey created Michigan's first mental health treatment court, a diversionary program intended to keep people with mental illnesses out of the criminal justice system and focus the mental health system more on prevention than on punishment.  Tom Leonard initially opposed the move, but now says he is “proud to say that [he] was wrong,” and that it was the right idea.  The successful court has been copied into other counties, and it recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, with Leonard helping to mark the occasion.\n\nAfter being elected Speaker, Leonard highlighted mental illness as a top priority for the House during his term, specifically promoting early intervention efforts like he those he saw first-hand in Genesee County.  Leonard created a bipartisan task force to travel around the state listening to testimony on various issues with the state's mental health system and collecting potential legislative reforms to address the situation.  The task force completed its tour in late 2017 presented its findings in a public report and began drafting legislation in January 2018.  Dozens of those recommendations have since been passed by the state House.\n\n\nThe first bill introduced in the Michigan House under Leonard was House Bill 4001, a measure to reduce the state income tax.  The income tax had been raised under then-Gov.  in 2009 while the state struggled with a budget shortfall.  The rate increase was intended to be temporary, but it never came back down to the original level.\n\nLeonard pushed to reduce the tax back to 3.9%, but ultimately fell three votes short in a late-night session at the state Capitol.  Republican governor  opposed the move.\n\nFollowing the federal tax reform effort, House leadership introduced a new plan to cut taxes for Michigan workers, increasing the personal exemption and giving a special credit to senior citizens.  The tax cut passed with a large, bipartisan majority on January 25, 2018.\n\n\nIn early 2017, the Michigan House introduced, debated and unanimously passed a series of reforms to expand the state's Freedom of Information Act and open the state Legislature to open records requests for the first time. Leonard pushed for the plan opening his own chamber and the governor's office to the public, including hosting a large, bipartisan public announcement of the bill in the Capitol building. However, opposition from the Senate and the governor's refusal to sign it ended the plan.\n\n\nCiting the highest auto insurance rates in the nation, Leonard teamed up with Detroit's Democratic mayor  to propose reform's to Michigan's current no-fault auto insurance system.  The proposed bill would have introduced more options for drivers in their auto coverage and would have saved drivers up to 50% on their monthly bills. The legislation did not pass after failing to garner sufficient support to pass.\n\n\nIn 2018, Leonard proposed repealing Michigan's driver responsibility fees, which were additional surcharges assessed on top of tickets from driving infractions instituted during the state's mid-2000s budget crisis.  Leonard also wanted to forgive the outstanding fines assessed to Michigan drivers under the program.  Many drivers who incurred the fees and were unable to afford them incurred additional fines for nonpayment and fell further in debt, eventually losing their licenses. By 2017, more than 350,000 residents had lost their licenses due to nonpayment and the additional fines, and 300,000 owed back payments to the state for previous fees.  With the program under growing criticism and thousands losing their licenses weekly, legislators who passed the program into law began to call for its repeal.\n\nGov. Rick Snyder had signed a bill phasing out the program after 5 years in 2014, but Leonard wanted an immediate end to the fees and a complete forgiveness of past fines.  After a long standoff, Gov. Snyder backed down and agreed to Leonard's plan in early 2018. House Bill 5040, which immediately repealed the driver responsibility fee program and fully forgave the outstanding debts, was passed by the House in early 2018 and later signed into law.  Because of this plan, on October 1, 2018, the 350,000 Michigan drivers who lost their licenses because of the program will be able to reapply and regain their ability to drive legally.\n\n\nThe first bills signed into law in Michigan in 2017 were a package of bills to reform the state's prison system and reduce recidivism.  A similar package of bills had failed during the previous term.\n\nLeonard also supported an effort to reform civil asset forfeiture, a practice he said  “opens the door for abuse.”   Efforts to reform civil asset forfeiture had been smaller and more incremental in recent years, but the version Leonard pushed through required a conviction for the first time.  The Detroit News called the bill an “important” reform.\n\n\nAfter U.S. Attorney General  moved to prosecute medical marijuana patients nationwide, Leonard said his fellow Republican, Sessions, should \"back off.\" Leonard called marijuana a states' rights issue and emphasized that Michigan voters had already overwhelmingly voted in favor of legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nLeonard does not personally support recreational marijuana.  However, he has committed to doing everything he can as the state's attorney general to uphold marijuana legalization if the voters pass it into law.\n\n\nBefore beginning his term as Speaker of the House, Leonard named reforming Michigan's teacher pension system as one of his top priorities for the coming year.  Legislative leaders introduced the plan early in 2017 but were met with resistance from Gov. Rick Snyder.  After a protracted standoff over the state budget, the governor relented and the pension reform passed into law.   Legislative leaders had been trying to reform the system for years with no results until Leonard's plan succeeded.\n\n\nServing in House leadership every term in the state legislature, Leonard has been involved in annual budget negotiations.  As the Speaker of the House, Leonard selected  to be the Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee.  Cox is the first woman to ever hold the title.  As speaker, Leonard named local schools, road repairs, mental health programming, and strengthening public safety as his top budget priorities.  In both years of his term, those priorities all saw increased funding, even as overall spending was lowered.  Local school funding and road repair funding were increased to all-time record high levels, $14.9 billion and more than $4 billion respectively.\n\nLeonard also leveraged budget negotiations in both years to gain support for additional policy reforms.  In 2017, Leonard secured reforms to Michigan's underfunded teacher pension system after a long standoff with the governor.  Gov. Rick Snyder did not support that plan, but Leonard and his legislative partners eventually won a change described as the “most innovative teacher pension reform in the nation.”\n\nIn 2018, Leonard used the budget process to push for the repeal of driver responsibility fees and a reform package centered on new school safety initiatives.  The repeal was signed into law, and the budget included $61 million in funding for school safety programs.\n\n\nMichigan had an unexpected $175m budget surplus at the end of 2017, and there was a general consensus among state leaders to use the funding on road repairs.  This would have been in addition to the most recent state budget, which already includes more than $4b in road funding, an all-time high. Leonard found a way to spend the money faster and get it out into the roads one construction season earlier, fixing roads one year earlier than they would have been fixed otherwise.  The governor agreed and signed the additional funding into law in March 2018.\n\n\nOn February 18, 2022, Leonard expressed opposition to the decision in '''', which protects the use of s for married couples. Leonard is opposed to the decision in '''', which protects a pregnant woman's choice on .\n\n\nLeonard supports a \"forensic audit\" of the results of the  based on unproven claims of widespread voter fraud.\n\n\n\nIn October 2017, Tom Leonard announced his campaign to be Michigan's next attorney general.  Leonard would be the first attorney general to have previous experience working in the office.  Leonard named fighting , prosecuting s and putting a stop to the  as his top priorities. During the campaign, Leonard refused to say whether he would support lawsuits to overturn the . He has been endorsed by the Police Officers Association of Michigan.

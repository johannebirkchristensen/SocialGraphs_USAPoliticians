Dunkin previously served as a  member of the , representing the 5th District from December 2002 until January 2017 and as an appointed by Governor  to fill a vacancy on the Board of Commissioners for the   in May 2018, serving until December of that same year.\n\n\nBorn February 12, 1966 in Chicago, Dunkin was raised in the  housing project on the city's Near-north side. After graduating from  in 1984, Dunkin went on to earn his associate degree from Loop College (now known as ). Dunkin continued his education at  where he earned his bachelor's degree in Political Science and later his master's degree in social welfare from the  at the . As a youth, Dunkin was influenced by , Illinois politician and founder of the .\n\n\nDunkin worked as social worker for many years. Most recently, he was the Director of the Robert Taylor  of Chicago, where he managed over $2.5 million in program services. He also worked as a consultant for the City of Chicago Department of Health and Department on Aging. He interned with U.S.  Health Care Financing Administration, and United States Senator . Dunkin is currently a member of the Attorney Registration Disciplinary Commission (appointed by Illinois Supreme Court), Board of the , Lawson , Near North Health Services Corp,  fraternity and the Governor's Film Task Force.\n\n\nAs a member of the , Dunkin served on seven committees:  International Trade & Commerce, Financial Institutions, Insurance, Mass Transit, Appropriations-High Education, Telecommunications, and Chairman of Tourism and Conventions. Dunkin was also a member of the . Representative Ken Dunkin was the Chief Sponsor for the Illinois Film Tax Credit.  This legislation generated thousands of union and non-union jobs throughout the state and hundreds of millions of dollars in local and state tax revenue.  His film credit encouraged major film, commercial and television such as \"Batman-The Dark Knight\",\"The Beast\", \"Public Enemy\", \"Barbershop 1 & 2\", \"The Break-Up\", \"Roll-Bounce\", \"Ocean's 12,\" \"The Weather Man\", \"Spider-Man 2\", \"Derailed\", \"Transformers 3\", etc. to be shot in Illinois.\n\nDunkin served as a State Lawmaker for over 15 years and was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives. He was becoming a ranking member with influence and did not side with the Madigan allyship that many Democrats found shelter under. Because of that, several times he had to stand up for his own position when many others disagreed.\n\nIn 2013, Representative Dunkin voted \"yea\" to a plan that amended state employee pension plans by drastically reducing the constitutionally protected benefits of Illinois state employees in retirement.  The Illinois Supreme Court ultimately found these legislative changes to be unconstitutional. Dunkin later \"no-showed\" (did not vote) on an important vote in the House. House Democrats were attempting of override a veto by Governor  on SB 1229. SB 1229 which would have empowered an arbitrator to decide negotiation disputes between public sector unions and the governor. Its implementation would have impeded the Governor's ability to force a \"lock-out\" of state workers during contract negotiations and also prevented the union from striking. As reported by the ''Chicago Sun-times'', Dunkin, responding over text, played coy initially when a ''Sun-Times'' reporter asked him about his absence:\n\n\"Why, what's going on??\" Dunkin responded. He then said: \"I'm out of town as I informed the Speaker et al last week. Period.\"\n When defending his decision to no-show on the SB1229 vote,  Rep. Dunkin's response was, \"This bill meant nothing to the average person.\"\n\nOn November 10, 2015, Representative Dunkin once again sided with Governor Rauner rather than his Democratic caucus involving a vote on child care assistance. House Democrats were just one vote short  voting 70-35 on Senate Bill 570. It needed 71 votes to pass. Rep. Ken Dunkin, D-Chicago, did not vote  showing some tension between House Democrats and the administration.\n\"'Come on, Ken!'\" House Democrats implored as Dunkin did not vote on two key bills favored by colleagues. […]\n\n\"Let me be clear that no one bears more responsibility today for the defeat of this legislation, which protects our children and child care and home care in Illinois than Rep. Ken Dunkin himself,\" Jaquie Algee, vice president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois said at a press conference organized by House Speaker Michael Madigan.\n\n– At one point during an intense, emotional floor debate, state Rep. Jaime Andrade stripped Dunkin's nameplate from the front of his seat, walked it over to the Republican side of the chamber then threw it down, saying: \"He's all yours now.\"\n\nThe Illinois AFL-CIO Executive Board voted on December 17, 2015 to endorse Juliana Stratton for State Representative in the Democratic Primary Election for the 5th District. Stratton took on incumbent Ken Dunkin, who had sided with Gov. Bruce Rauner, casting controversial votes against the interests of working families as well as issues including child care eligibility, funding for services for seniors and the disabled and an arbitration mechanism to keep state services functioning in the event of bargaining impasse.\n\n\"There needs to a change in the 5th District,\" AFL-CIO President Michael Carrigan said. \"The voters will know that there is a person in this race that cares about her community and not political alliances. As she has been all of her life, she will be their voice.\"\nThere are nearly 16,000 members of union families in the 5th House District.\n\nMany prominent Democrats in Illinois officially endorsed Dunkin's opponent, Julia Stratton, including his \"mentor\" Jesse White  White expanded upon his endorsement, saying \"I always say when you take on a job, you take on the responsibility for everybody,\" White said. \"In the case of Ken Dunkin, he has been a big disappointment to me and to his constituents, to the people of the state of Illinois and to the people of the 5th District. The message is they can no longer afford Ken Dunkin.\" […]\n\nOpponents of Ken Dunkin's re-election campaign distributed a mailer showing Rep. Dunkin in a police mugshot from nearly two decades earlier. The ad was allegedly  paid for by Ald. Brendan Reilly's 42nd Ward Democratic Organization. Crain's Chicago Business referred to the message of the ad as 'brutal'.\n\nOn March 7, 2016, Representative Dunkin's opponent, attorney Juliana Stratton, announced that the President of the United States had personally endorsed her in the upcoming primary. The endorsement came just weeks after Representative Dunkin claimed that the President had given him a \"shout out\" and \"reaffirmed\" Dunkin's decision to side with Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on a number of key issues. When President Obama was addressing the Illinois General Assembly, the POTUS said reaching political compromise across the aisle \"doesn't make me a sellout to my own party.\" Dunkin stood up and shouted \"Yes!\" and Obama replied, \"Sit down Dunkin, we'll talk later.\"\n\nOn March 7, 2015, the ''Chicago Sun-times'' reported that the Dunkin campaign was facing serious allegations of voter fraud within a high-stakes Illinois House campaign; catching the attention of Cook County prosecutors. Secretary of State Jesse White and Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) appeared at a South Side press conference to accuse Rep. Ken Dunkin of buying early votes in the battle to keep his 5th District seat in the state House of Representatives. Dunkin's opponent, Juliana Stratton, also stood nearby as Dowell shared what she claimed is video evidence of Dunkin's alleged scheme  purportedly shot by people who infiltrated the vote-buying operation and cast ballots in exchange for \"crisp $50 bills.\" \"This is a violation of all laws of human decency, and shame on Mr. Dunkin and his organization for doing this,\" Dunkin's \"former mentor\" Jesse White said.\n\nDemocratic mayor  opined on the Dunkin-Rauner alliance recently, stating: \"We've had a standstill down in Springfield, and I think the Governor and Ken Dunkin have a partnership, and I think it's bad for Chicago, bad for Illinois. And the question is: Are we going to have somebody rewarded that, in my view, is not going to pass a budget that invests in Chicago and in Chicago's schoolchildren, or are we going to hold everything hostage?\". On March 15, 2016, Democratic challenger Juliana Stratton defeated Ken Dunkin in a decisive manner, as reported by WGN News.\n\n\n\n\n\n* at the Illinois General Assembly\n**, , , , , \n* \n* at Illinois House Democrats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was a member of a group of conservative state senators elected in 1992. They often challenged the leadership of the  and were dubbed the \"Fab Five.\" The group also included , ,  and .\n\n\n\nFitzgerald challenged long-time incumbent Republican congressman  in the 1994 Republican primary for the 8th Illinois congressional district. In a multi-candidate field, Fitzgerald lost to Crane 40% to 33%.\n\n\n\nFitzgerald announced his intention to challenge one-term  incumbent U.S. Senator  in the 1998 election. He faced   in the Republican primary. Didrickson had the support of the state Republican party, including Governor  and former Republican presidential nominee , who served as her national campaign chairman. A hard-fought  ensued, and Fitzgerald narrowly defeated the establishment candidate, becoming the Republican nominee.\n\nDespite great support from Republicans and Independents, he had alienated some of the party establishment during the primary. Meanwhile, Braun was helped by notable Democrats such as   and U.S. Congressman ; final polling had the candidates running even. Fitzgerald defeated Moseley Braun in the general election by a 2.9% margin.\n\nHe was the first Republican in Illinois to win a U.S. Senate race in 20 years and the only Republican challenger in the country to defeat an incumbent Democratic senator in the  cycle.\n\n\n  on  in 2002]]\n]]\n\nFitzgerald had two major moments in the spotlight in the Senate, the first in 2000 when he ed a massive federal spending bill because it included funds for the  in Springfield. He accused Republican governor , who later served a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, of opposing competitive bidding so he could dole money to political allies, saying \"I want Illinois to get a $150 million (Abraham Lincoln) library, not a $50 million library that just happens to cost $150 million.\" His second major moment was following the , when Congress quickly passed a massive bailout measure for most of the major airlines, which were in trouble financially. Standing alone out of all members of the U.S. Senate, Fitzgerald delivered a speech, \"Who will bail out the American taxpayer\", arguing that the airlines would simply go through the money and remain financially unstable. The bill passed 96–1.\n\nFitzgerald was staunchly conservative on such issues as  (except to save the life of the mother),  and taxes, but on some issues he broke with his conservative colleagues, particularly environmental issues; he opposed drilling in the  throughout his tenure in the Senate. Fitzgerald also supported \"reasonable\" ,  and the   legislation.\n\nThroughout his tenure in the Senate, Fitzgerald battled with the state Republican Party leadership. He insisted on the appointment of an out-of-state ,  (unrelated) to investigate corruption in the Illinois state government. Though state party officials wanted a \"friendly\" attorney for Illinois, Fitzgerald insisted on someone who did not have friends or enemies in the Illinois government. Several indictments resulted, including that of former Republican  , who was eventually convicted of several criminal , and Democratic  , who many years later was convicted of attempting to sell the  seat vacated by Fitzgerald's successor and future  . The scandal was seen as ensuring Illinois' reputation as one of the most politically corrupt states.\n\nWhen the Republican establishment made clear that they would not support him for reelection, Fitzgerald announced he would retire at the end of his current term. Republicans nominated businessman  for the seat in the primaries.  However, Ryan was later pressured by the Illinois Republican Party to withdraw because of publicity received from the contents of his previously-sealed divorce case.  Fitzgerald stood by Ryan and supported him, despite the pressure from the media and the Illinois Republican party on Ryan to withdraw.  Just 86 days before the election, the party drafted Maryland native  as the nominee. Keyes was accused of \",\" and was defeated by  by more than 40 percent of the vote.

Watson disagreed with Blagojevich's 2003 plan to mortgage the state's Chicago office building, the , for $200 million over 10 years to raise funds for that year's budget hole. Watson said he was \"really troubled by this\" and noted other debts the state had taken on that year, such as a $10 billion bond to shore up state pension funds.\n\n\nIn October 2008, Watson suffered a  which was reported to be very minor. On November 4, 2008, he sent a letter to the Republican Caucus stating that he would not seek re-election for the Senate Minority Leadership. Watson returned to the Senate for one day in late November, where he was greeted by reporters and House Speaker . Watson said he was in therapy and anticipated a full recovery.\n\nIn February 2009, Watson announced that he would resign his Senate seat effective February 16, 2009; Watson said that due to his stroke, he could not effectively carry out his duties for his district. GOP county chairs of the nine counties that make up Watson's district will vote on a replacement for Watson in the Senate. Watson said: \"I've come a long way in my recovery, but have a long way to go. That's not fair to my constituents.\" Watson's resignation was effective February 16, 2009.

Daley was elected mayor in 1989 and was reelected five times until declining to run for a seventh term. At 22 years, his was the longest tenure in Chicago mayoral history, surpassing the 21-year mayoralty of his father, .\n\nAs Mayor, Daley took over the , developed tourism, oversaw the construction of , increased environmental efforts and the rapid development of the city's central business district downtown and adjacent near North, near South and near West sides. He also approved expansion of city workers' benefits to their partners regardless of gender, and advocated for gun control.\n\nDaley received criticism when family, personal friends, and political allies disproportionately benefited from city contracting. He took office in a city with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest  in Chicago history. A national leader in , he temporarily reduced budgetary shortfalls by leasing and selling public assets to private corporations, but this practice removed future sources of revenue, contributing to the city's near insolvency at the end of his tenure. Police brutality was a recurring issue during his mayorship.\n\n\nRichard M. Daley is the fourth of seven children and eldest son of  and , who later became Mayor and First Lady of Chicago in 1955. Born on April 24, 1942, he grew up in , a historically Irish-American neighborhood located on Chicago's . Daley is a brother of , former  and former  under President ; , a commissioner on the  and chairman of the Board's Finance Committee; and Michael Daley, an attorney with Daley & Georges, a law firm founded by their father Richard J. Daley, that specializes in  law and is often hired by developers to help get zoning changes through city hall. Daley was married to Margaret \"Maggie\" Corbett until her death on , November 24, 2011 after a decade-long battle with , which had spread to her bones and liver.  in the  commemorates her, and her nonprofit  continues to serve Chicago's young people. They have four children: Nora, Patrick, Elizabeth and Kevin, all born at  in Chicago. Their second son, Kevin, died at age two of complications from  in 1981. Daley was raised .\n\nDaley graduated from  high school in Chicago and obtained his  from  in 1964, having transferred from  in , Rhode Island after two years. In 1962, at age 19, home on Christmas break, Daley was ticketed for running a stop sign at Huron and , and the '''' headline was \"Mayor's Son Gets Ticket, Uses No Clout,\" with a subhead reading \"Quiet Boy.\"\n\nSources conflict on Daley's military record. The only book-length biography of Daley makes no mention of military service. A 1995 profile in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' stated that Daley served in the  from 1961 to 1967, while a 1996 profile in '''' cited 1960 to 1964. A civilian website for Marines and their families found no military record for Daley.\n\nDaley earned a  degree from . He passed the Illinois  on his third try. Daley later reflected, \"I flunked the bar exam twice. I had to keep studying harder and harder and harder. I passed it the third time.\" Daley never tried a case.\n\nDaley was elected to his first office as a  to the 1969 Illinois , which created the current  (adopted after voters approved it in ). According to journalist Rick Perlstein, in June 1972, Daley led a mob on behalf of his father's Democratic Party regulars against pro- reformers meeting in a church in Illinois' Fifth Congressional District. The action was unsuccessful and the reformers' slate (which included ) replaced the Daley slate at the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.\n\nAfter his father died in 1976, Daley succeeded his father as the 11th Ward Democratic , a party post, until succeeded in the post by his brother  in 1980. With John P. Daley holding the post from 1980 to the present, a Daley has held the post of 11th Ward Committeeman for 60 years.\n\n\nAfter Edward Nihill stepped down, Daley, with the support of the Democratic political organization, was elected to the , serving from 1972 to 1980. State Senator Daley rarely spoke to reporters and didn't hold a news conference for six years. Daley chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. Daley was named one of Illinois' ten worst state legislators by '''' \"for arrogance, for sharklike qualities, for living off his father's name, and for pulling puppet strings attached to some of the worst members of the Senate.\" He was considered \"too shrewd to be one of the worst, but he controls so many of the worst senators that he belongs on the list to represent all of them.\" After the Spring 1975 state legislative session, Chicago Democrat , who served with Daley as Illinois Constitutional Convention delegates and as State Senators, blamed \"dirty little Richie\" for frustrating her  legislative agenda in the state legislature.\n\n\n, Daley challenged incumbent   for  . Democratic Mayor  endorsed Alderman  in the Democratic primary, and after Daley prevailed in the primary, endorsed Carey in the general election. Daley prevailed and served from 1981 to 1989. His election over Carey saw him win by merely sixteen thousand votes, one of the narrowest wins for the Cook County State's Attorney election.\n\n\nIn February 1982, Andrew Wilson was arrested for the murder of two Chicago police officers. Wilson was taken to Area 2 detective headquarters on the South Side for interrogation under Chicago Police Detective . Dr. John Raba, Medical Director of Cermak Health Services, the prison hospital in the Cook County Hospital system, examined Wilson, determined Wilson had been , and complained in writing to then Chicago Police Superintendent :\n\nI examined Mr. Andrew Wilson on February 15 & 16, 1982. He had multiple bruises, swellings and abrasions on his face and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.\n\nBrzeczek forwarded the letter to State's Attorney Daley. Daley never replied, and charges were never brought against any officers. Daley's prosecutors convicted Wilson and his brother Jackie of murder, and Andrew Wilson was sentenced to death. On April 2, 1987, the  overturned the convictions, ruling that Wilson was forced to confess involuntarily after being beaten by police.\n\n\n\n\nIn November 1982, Daley announced his first campaign for mayor. The candidates in the three-way Democratic primary, which included incumbent Mayor , a former protégée of his father, and Congressman , held a series of four televised debates. Daley finished third. Many of Richard J.'s political allies blamed Richard M. for splitting the white vote, enabling Washington to become Chicago's first black mayor.\n\n\n\n\nOn November 25, 1987, Mayor Washington died in office of a heart attack. On December 2, 1987, the  appointed Alderman  as mayor until a special election for the remaining two years of the term could be held in 1989. Daley announced his candidacy on December 6, 1988, saying\n\nLet's face it: we have a problem in Chicago. The name-calling and politics at City Hall are keeping us from tackling the real issues&nbsp;... I may not be the best speaker in town, but I know how to run a government and how to bring people together.\n\n worked for the Daley campaign as a fundraiser,  as campaign strategist,  as chief strategist, and  as a campaign aide. Among four Daley campaign appearances on a Sunday shortly before the primary was a rally of  at 4808 S. Archer Ave. In a videotaped television newscast, it appeared that Daley said, \"You want a white mayor to sit down with everybody.\" Sawyer said he was \"shocked.\" Daley explained, \"It was my standard stump speech. I'm not maybe the best speaker in town, but I have never used the word [white].\" That Friday, the campaign watchdog group CONDUCT censured Daley and commended Sawyer for his \"rejection of racially inflammatory comments.\"\n\nDaley defeated Sawyer in the primary. In the 1989 general election, Daley faced Republican candidate , a former Democratic alderman who had opposed Mayor Washington, and  , the candidate of the newly created Harold Washington Party. Daley won  the general election on April 4, 1989. Daley was inaugurated as Mayor of Chicago on April 24, 1989, his 47th birthday, at a ceremony in .\n\n\n\nDaley presided over the most docile City Council since his father. One of the new mayor's first acts was to appropriate the City Council's power to approve city contracts, a right aldermen exercised under former Mayors Washington and Sawyer. Daley's first budget proposal, the 1990 budget, included $3 billion in spending,}} $50 million more than 1989,}} featured a $25 million reduction in the property tax levy,}} extended Mayor Sawyer's hiring freeze, piloted recycling, and privatized the city's tow truck fleet. Daley became the first Chicago Mayor to lead Chicago's , at the 20th annual parade on Sunday, June 26, 1989. On August 22, 1990, Daley told reporters that \"people are getting hurt in drive-by shoot-a-longs.\" In December 1990,  issued a report \"Allegations of Police Torture in Chicago, Illinois\" calling for a full inquiry into allegations that some Chicago police officers tortured criminal suspects between 1972 and 1984.\n\n\nOn April 2, 1991, Daley was reelected to a second term (his first full, four-year term), with 70.7% of the vote, over African American civil rights attorney and Appellate Judge . Questioned about the city's rising homicide rate on September 10, 1991, Daley said \"The more killing and homicides you have, the more havoc it prevents.\"\n\n\nOn the weekend of March 1–2, 1992, Daley and his wife arranged for 16-year-old son  to stay with relatives while they attended a family event in New York. Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends, drove his father's new  to the Daley second home in  and threw a party Saturday night without parental consent or adult supervision. Someone asked two Filipino and two white youths to leave, racial epithets were exchanged, and a fistfight broke out. Patrick retrieved Richard J. Daley's shotgun from the house and gave it to his cousin, who was aged 17. A youth was seriously injured when a juvenile struck him in the head with a baseball bat. On Monday a sobbing Mayor Daley read a statement at a City Hall press conference, pausing repeatedly as he tried to maintain his composure,\n\nI am very disappointed, as any parent would be, after his son held a party in their home while his parents were away. I am more deeply distressed for the welfare of the young man who was injured in this fight.\n\nPatrick pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of furnishing alcohol to minors and disturbing the peace and was sentenced to six months' probation, 50 hours of community service in Grand Beach, fined $1,950}} and ordered to pay restitution to his parents for property damage. His cousin pleaded guilty to aiming a firearm without malice and was fined $1,235.}}  Sixteen other youths were charged with juvenile and adult offenses. The injured youth recovered.\n\n\nDaley took control of the  system in 1995 and appointed . When Vallas left the post to run for governor, Daley chose the relatively obscure , who later became the  under Barack Obama, to lead the district. On March 19, 1997, the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance, which made employee benefits available to same-sex partners of City employees. Daley said it was an issue of fairness.\n\n\nThe first major public corruption scandal of Daley's tenure as mayor involved the circumstances of the resignation of his City Council , Alderman Patrick Huels, in October 1997. Daley, Huels, and another close friend Michael Tadin grew up within two blocks on S. Emerald Avenue in . Huels attended De La Salle Institute, the same high school attended by Daley, his father, and . Huels worked for the city's  Department as a laborer and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor  died, 11th Ward Alderman Bilandic was named acting mayor, and Huels, then 26, replaced Bilandic as alderman. Huels chaired the council's Transportation Committee and became Mayor Richard M. Daley's floor leader. In the summer of 2007, in reaction to ongoing indictments and convictions of aldermen, Daley and Huels shepherded a package of ethics reforms through city council. Huels owned a security firm, SDI Security, Inc. along with his wife and his brother, a Chicago police lieutenant. In the mid-1990s, the firm had about 390 full-time employees and was grossing $7 million a year. Huels was president and a director, and Council Finance Committee Chairman Alderman  (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971}}  in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the  placed a  on SDI for $326,951}}  and in June 1996 for $997,382}}  for failing to pay , including money withheld from its employees' pay checks.\n\nIn 1970, after high school, Tadin went to work for Marina Cartage; within a decade, he owned the company, and over the next 15 years expanded it from 20 trucks to 150. Between 1992 and 1997, the city paid Marina Cartage and another Tadin company $49 million for supplying the city with snow removal and other heavy equipment and operators. Tadin earned millions of dollars by buying land cheaply, then leasing or selling it to the city. Marina Cartage used Huels' SDI Security services since 1992. In 1995, with Huels' support, the City Council approved a tax reduction which halved the assessment on a new $4.5 million}} headquarters and trucking terminal for Marina Cartage at 4450 S. Morgan in Huels' ward, a tax savings of as much as $80,000}} per year. In 1996, with Huels' support, the City Council approved a $1.1 million}} direct grant for the construction of the facility. Weeks later, Tadin created a new company which was used to originate a $1.25 million}} bailout loan to SDI. Daley said Huels \"did the right thing resigning\" and claimed no knowledge of Huels' business dealings. \"I don't get into people's private lives. I am not into that,\" Daley said. Daley announced an executive order and new ethics legislation, saying:\n\nThe goal of this executive order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.&nbsp;... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantageor a disadvantagein obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.&nbsp;... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn everything there is to know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.\n\n\nOn February 23, 1999, Daley won reelection to a fourth term with 68.9 percent of the vote over challenger U.S. Congressman . In August 1999, prompted by police excessive-force incidents in Chicago, New York and other cities, the U.S. affiliate of Amnesty International issued a report \"Race, Rights & Brutality: Portraits of Abuse in the USA,\" that called on federal officials to better document excessive-force cases and to pursue prosecutions of the officers involved. In October 1999, the organization issued a report \"Summary of Amnesty International's concerns on police abuse in Chicago\" which expressed concerns including improper interrogation tactics, excessive force, shootings of unarmed suspects, and the detention and interrogation of children.\n\nThe Duff family formed a janitorial services company, Windy City Maintenance Inc., one month after Daley's inauguration. , president of the , said that Daley recommended that Dumont's wife , then director of the Mayor's Office of Special Events, award city contracts to Duff family companies. Daley denied steering contracts to the Duffs, and said he would \"look into\" the allegations, while stopping short of promising to do so, saying \"I don't promise. That's the wrong word to use. You know&nbsp;... promising, promising. We do look into it, yes.\" In September 2003, a federal investigation led to indictments of Patricia Green Duff, her sons John M. Duff and James Duff, and others on charges they won nearly $100 million}} in city contracts through the city's set-aside program by misrepresenting their companies as women- and minority-owned. John M. Duff pleaded guilty to 33 counts of racketeering, fraud and other charges on January 10, 2004. A 1978 state law designed by Illinois Democrats gave the Mayor the power to appoint to fill vacancies in the City Council rather than holding special elections, and by 2002 more than a third of the council's 50 aldermen were initially appointed by Daley. The Council became even more of a  than in Richard J. Daley's terms. In the 18 months from January 12, 2000 to June 6, 2001, only 13 votes in the council were divided, less than one a month. 32 aldermen supported the mayor 90-100% of the time and another 14 80-89% of the time.\n\n\nOn February 26, 2003, Daley took 78.5% of the vote to prevail over challenger Reverend Paul Jakes Jr. Daley endorsed , saying on February 18, 2004, he would have \"no problem\" with Cook County issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. '''' magazine in its April 25, 2005 issue named Daley as the best out of five mayors of large cities in the United States, and characterized Daley as having \"imperial\" style and power. In May 2006, in Geneva, Switzerland the United Nations  released a report which noted the \"limited investigation and lack of prosecution\" into allegations of torture in Areas 2 and 3 of the Chicago Police Department and called on American authorities to \"promptly, thoroughly and impartially\" investigate the allegations, and provide the committee with more information. Daley was inducted into the  in 2006 as a Friend of the Community.\n\n\n\nA long-standing agreement between the city and state required the city to maintain and operate , a small, downtown, lakefront airport on  used by  aircraft and helicopters, until 2011 or turn it over to the state. On September 12, 1996, the City Council approved Daley's plan to convert the airport into a park, and the state began planning to take over operation of the airport. Fresh off a 2003 re-election mandate, one of Daley's first major acts was ordering the demolition of Meigs Field. On Sunday, March 30, 2003, shortly before midnight, transport trucks carrying construction equipment moved onto Meigs with Chicago Police escort. By early Monday morning, city crews excavated six large X's into the only runway. The city's 50 aldermen, Illinois Governor , the  and the  were not consulted on the plan. The demolition of the runway trapped planes. In the days following, many of those aircraft were able to take off using the .\n\n\"To do this any other way would have been needlessly contentious,\" Daley explained at a news conference Monday morning. Daley argued that the airport was a threat to Chicago's high-rise cityscape and its high-profile skyscrapers, such as the  and the . Daley criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying \"Now, think of that; Mickey and Minnie have it. I mean, I can't believe that. They get it first before we get it?\", referring to the post- air space restrictions in place over . \"The signature act of Richard Daley's 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field,\" according to '''' columnist . \"He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could,\" ''Chicago Tribune'' columnist  wrote of Daley. \"The issue is Daley's increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements, legal challenges, negotiations, compromise or any of that messy give-and-take normally associated with democratic government,\" the ''Chicago Tribune'' editorialized. The Federal Aviation Administration cited the city for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty-day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure. The city was fined $33,000,}} the maximum allowable. The city paid the fine and repaid $1 million}} in misspent federal airport development grants. Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned, in spite of the fact that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time, in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded.\n\n\n\nThe $40 million-a-year Hired Truck program was the biggest scandal of Daley's first 15 years as mayor. The Hired Truck Program hired private truck companies to do city work. A six-month investigation by the '''' resulted in a three-day series of articles in January 2004 that revealed some participating companies were being paid for doing little or no work, had  connections or were tied to city employees, or paid bribes to get into the program. Between 1996 and 2004, companies in the Hired Truck Program gave more than $800,000 in campaign contributions to various politicians, including Daley, House Speaker , and Governor ; Daley received at least $108,575 and his brother John Daley and his ward organization more than $47,500.\n\nMark Gyrion, Daley's , was a superintendent of garages for the city's Water Management Department, and among his duties was deciding when City-owned trucks should be sold for scrap. Gyrion's mother-in-law's firm, Jacz Transportation, participated in the Hired Truck Program, receiving about $1 million between 1998 and 2004. Jacz Transportation bought a truck three days after the city sold it to a  dealership and then leased it back to the city. Gyrion was accused of failing to disclose his mother-in-law's role in the Hired Truck Program and the transfer of the truck. Gyrion was fired and Jacz Transportation was one of 13 truck companies suspended from the Hired Truck program. About 35% of the 70 firms in the program were suspended or referred to the city's Inspector General. The program was overhauled in 2004, and phased out in 2005.\n\n\nOn July 5, 2006, Robert Sorich, formally, director of the Mayor's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and, informally, Daley's  chief, and Timothy McCarthy, Sorich's aide, were each convicted on two counts of mail fraud connected to rigging blue-collar city jobs and promotions. Sorich's best friend, former Streets and Sanitation official Patrick Slattery was convicted of one count of mail fraud. A former Streets and Sanitation managing deputy commissioner was found guilty of lying to federal agents about political hiring. Sorich, McCarthy and Slattery lived in the Bridgeport neighborhood in 11th Ward, the Daley family's home neighborhood and ward. \"I've never known them to be anything but hard working, and I feel for them at this difficult time,\" Daley said. \"It is fair criticism to say I should have exercised greater oversight to ensure that every worker the city hired, regardless of who recommended them, was qualified and that proper procedures were always followed,\" Daley admitted a few days later. Weeks later, , a Democratic political consultant whose clients included Daley, defended patronage in an  in the ''''.\n\n\nMayor Daley's son  was an  student at the  working as an unpaid intern at Cardinal Growth, a Chicago  firm, when he profited from two Cardinal Growth ventures formed to win city contracts while concealing his role. Patrick's cousin, and Mayor Daley's nephew, is Robert G. Vanecko. In June 2003, Patrick and Vanecko formed a Delaware company, MSS Investors LLC, and invested $65,000 each.}} MSS Investors LLC in turn purchased a 5% stake in Municipal Sewer Services, a Cardinal Growth venture. Patrick and Vanecko failed to disclose their ownership stake in Municipal Sewer Services as required by city ethics ordinances. Brunt Brothers Transfer Inc. was one of the largest black-owned contractors in the  program. Municipal Sewer Services partnered with Brunt Brothers Transfer Inc. in their bid for City sewer-inspection contracts. Five months after Patrick and Vanecko became owners, Municipal Sewer Services' city contract was extended by $3 million,}} the first of two no-bid contract extensions, totaled an additional 23 months and $4 million.}} Patrick and Vanecko cashed out their initial investment after about a year as the federal investigation into the Hired Truck program advanced. Patrick and Vanecko got a $13,114 \"tax distribution\" in December 2004. Patrick, then 29 and a recent University of Chicago MBA graduate, enlisted in the . The day after the Mayor's son's and nephew's hidden involvement in the city contract was disclosed by the '''', Daley spoke at a Chicago police recruit graduation ceremony, then left for ,  to see his son deployed. Before departing, Mayor Daley read a statement to reporters, his voice cracking, fighting back tears,\n\nI did not know about [Patrick's] involvement in this company. As an adult, he made that decision. It was a lapse in judgement for him to get involved with this company. I wish he hadn't done it. I know the expectations for elected officials, their families, are very highrightfully soespecially for me.&nbsp;... Patrick is a very good son. I love him. Maggie and I are very proud of him. I hope you respect I have nothing more to say on this.\n\nMayor Daley also said he didn't know if there were other city contracts involving the younger Daley. The city's  and federal authorities began investigations in December 2007. Patrick and Vanecko hired s. Municipal Sewer Services LLC folded in April 2008. In January 2011, Anthony Duffy, the president of Municipal Sewer Services, was charged with three counts of mail fraud in conjunction with minority-contracting and Jesse Brunt and his company, Brunt Brothers Transfer Inc., were indicted on three counts of mail fraud. Patrick and Vanecko were not charged.\n\nIn 2005, Concourse Communications, another Cardinal Growth venture, signed a city contract for airport  service at city-owned  and  airports. For years, the Daley administration maintained that Patrick had no financial stake in the deal. Concourse disclosed its investors to the city, as required, but Patrick was not reported. Patrick lined up investors for Concourse. On June 27, 2006, nine months after Concourse signed the contract, Concourse was sold at a 33% profit to  Inc. for $45 million.}} On June 30, 2006, Patrick received the first of five payments totaling $708,999.}} On December 3, 2007, shortly after Patrick received the last of those payments, Mayor Daley's press secretary, Jacquelyn Heard said Patrick Daley \"has no financial interest with the Wi-Fi contract at O'Hare.\" The '''' editorialized, \"...&nbsp;the conflict of interest was blatant.\"\n\n\n Richard M. Daley at the opening of the 2005 ''Revealing Chicago'' Exhibition in the  and  in .]] In 2003, an operating company included over 80 investors, including some of Mayor Daley's friends and neighbors won, under controversial circumstances, a lucrative contract to operate the , the only restaurant in the new . In 2005 Daley criticized the deal, saying that the city wanted to renegotiate the pact. The '''' dubbed the Park Grill the \"Clout Cafe\" and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals. The contract was never renegotiated, and after Daley announced he would not seek a seventh term, the owners of the Park Grill sought to sell. Deposed in August 2013 in Mayor 's administration's lawsuit to renegotiate the contract, former Mayor Daley responded \"I don't recall\" 139 times.\n\n\nIn January 2006, , a joint venture between the Australian  and Spanish , paid the City $1.83 billion}} for rights to operate the  and collect tolls for 99 years. The deal was the first of its kind in the U.S. In December 2006,  paid Chicago $563 million}} for a 99-year lease of the city's parking garages.  \"I'm the one who started talking about leasing public assets. No other city has done this in America,\" Daley recalled in 2009. -winning commentator  wrote of the deals in '''',\n\nUnfortunately, Daley's theorythat it can be better to get a sum X immediately, rather than getting over many years a sum Y that is substantially larger than Xassumes something that cannot be assumed. It assumes that governments will prudently husband sudden surges of revenue from the lease or sale of assets.\n\n\n\nOn February 6, 2008, the Chicago City Council approved, by a 41–6 vote, an increase in the city's  to fund the . Presiding over the meeting, Daley harshly chastized the dissenting aldermen. On March 15, 2010, Daley appointed two aldermen on the same day, bringing to 19 the number of alderman initially appointed by Daley.\n\n\nIn September 2008, Chicago accepted a $2.52 billion}} bid on a 99-year lease of  to a group of private investors, but the deal fell through due to the collapse of credit markets during the . In 2008, as Chicago struggled to close a growing budget deficit, the city agreed to a 75-year, $1.16 billion}} deal to lease its  system to an operating company created by . Daley said the \"agreement is very good news for the taxpayers of Chicago because it will provide more than $1 billion in net proceeds that can be used during this very difficult economy.\" The agreement quadrupled rates, in the first year alone, while the hours which people have to pay for parking were broadened from 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. – 9 p.m., and from Monday through Saturday to every day of the week. Additionally, the city agreed to compensate the new owners for loss of revenue any time any road with parking meters is closed by the city for anything from maintenance work to street festivals.\n* \n* \n* \n*  In three years, the proceeds from the lease were all but spent.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Daley entered into ten-year contracts with the city's labor unions to preclude labor unrest as Chicago launched a bid to host the .

In May 2010, Daley held a press conference to address gun control and a pending possible adverse decision in ''McDonald v. Chicago''. After Mick Dumke, a reporter for the '''', questioned the effectiveness of the city's handgun ban, Daley picked up a rifle with a bayonet from a display table of confiscated weapons and told him, \"If I put this up your butt, you'll find out how effective it is. Let me put a round up your, you know.\"\n* \n* |group=\"nb\"}} The remark was voted \"the stoopidest thing that Mayor Richard Daley the Younger has ever said\" in an online poll by the ''''.\n\nOn June 28, 2010, the  held, in a 5–4 decision in ''McDonald v. Chicago'', that the  was incorporated under the , thus protecting the right of an individual to \"keep and bear arms\" from local governments, and all but declared Mayor 's 1982 handgun ban unconstitutional. That afternoon, at a press conference concerning the gun ban, Daley said,\n\nWe'll publicly propose a new ordinance very soon&nbsp;... As a city we must continue to stand up&nbsp;... and fight for a ban on assault weapons&nbsp;... as well as a crackdown on gun shops&nbsp;... We are a country of laws not a nation of guns.\n\nDaley called a special meeting of the city council for four days later, and the Council approved a gun control ordinance revised to include city s.\n\n\nDaley came into office in a city with revenue-generating assets, manageable debt and flush pension funds, but he left behind a city with a  that Mayor-elect  estimated at $1.2 billion}} when under-funded s were included.

The city's budgets continued to increase even after the recession began, to more than $6 billion}} a year, and, when under-funded city employee pension funds were included, the city's annual  exceeded $1 billion. In January 2011,  downgraded to a \"negative\" outlook some of the revenue bonds issued for the $15 billion}}  and related infrastructure projects, citing the city's plan to postpone repayment of interest and principal on some construction bonds.\n\nIn his annual budget address in City Council Chambers on October 15, 2008, Daley proposed a 2009 budget totaling $5.97 billion,}} including not filling 1,350 vacancies on the 38,000 employee city payroll and $150 million}} in new revenue from a then-obscure parking meter lease deal to help erase a $469 million}} budget shortfall. The Daley administration employed an in-house staff of more than 50  officers across City departments at a cost of $4.7 million,}} and millions more on seven private public relations firms. \"It's worth it\", Daley said. On the first day of City Council hearings on Daley's 2009 budget proposal, several aldermen questioned the administration's public relations spending. On November 4, 2008, Jacquelyn Heard, the mayor's , said the city would halt spending on 10 public relations contracts that could have paid as much as $5 million}} each.\n\nIn his annual budget address on October 21, 2009, Daley projected a deficit for 2009 of more than $520 million.}} Daley proposed a 2010 budget totaling $6.14 billion,}} including spending $370 million}} from the $1.15 billion}} proceeds from the parking meter lease. In his annual budget address on October 13, 2010, Daley projected a deficit for 2010 of $655 million,}} the largest in city history. Daley proposed a 2011 budget totaling $6.15 billion,}} including spending all but $76 million}} of what remained of the parking meter lease proceeds, and received a standing ovation from aldermen.\n\n\nDaley's approval rating was at an all-time low of 35% by late 2009. On September 7, 2010, Daley announced that he would not seek a seventh term. \"I've always believed that every person, especially public officials, must understand when it's time to move on.

His experience with the DNC gave him the opportunity to work on numerous congressional election races. After the convention he also became a vice president of Operation PUSH.\n\nJackson was arrested on his twenty-first birthday in , following his participation in demonstrations against  at the South African Embassy. He had been arrested with his father and brother the year before in a similar activity.

The Republicans nominated Thomas Somer. Since the district was overwhelmingly Democratic, Jackson was the favorite for the December 12, 1995 special election. Jackson won the general election with 76% of the vote; his victory was widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known he would be a liberal voice in opposition to  . He took office on December 15, 1995. Jackson was perceived as less charismatic than his father and less credentialed than his predecessor, but his family pedigree was expected to help him politically. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no major party opposition in the November 1996 general election. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.\n\nAs he prepared to , Vice President  attempted to maintain good relations with the Jackson family, hoping to discourage Jackson's father from running for president against him.

Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the presiding officer was able to slightly delay the closing of the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport.

In 1997, '''' mentioned Jackson in their list of 100 people to watch in the new century, dubbed \"the Century Club\", and raised the question of whether he would be the first black president.

Bush intended to appoint both ,  and a third unnamed black to the , Jackson sought to prevent blacks from supporting Bush as Bush planned to reach out to blacks. Jackson partnered with Republican  to push for a third Chicago airport. Jackson said Hyde was the right wing complement to his own left wing role in pursuing support for the airport.

I've seen his leadership at work. I've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois.\" At the convention, Jackson started what was described as a \"hugfest\" in an attempt to unite the Illinois Democratic party, which had been squabbling internally. He started by hugging  (who had been upset that Jackson's wife was being positioned for Rush's seat when Rush had been ill earlier in the year) and then he hugged , who had been at odds with him over the proposed airport. He then asked if anyone else was mad at him. At this point Mayor Daley jumped up to hug Jackson. Jackson then said, \"I'm not going to be satisfied until I see  give  a hug.\"\n\nBefore the entire Congress was charged with seeking a solution to the  and overall , Jackson proposed that the  increase the allotment of . During the congressional debates on a federal bailout, Jackson worried about the viability of various plan iterations to his constituents.

Although he voted against the bill on September 29, 2008 he voted in support of the  on October 3, 2008.

He stated on September 7, 2006, that his final decision would come after the Congressional election in November. Jackson had built up a more moderate reputation than his father and had support that transcended racial lines. Jackson viewed his broad based support as a sign that the U.S. had advanced to the point where politicians from ethnic minorities could appeal to broad constituencies.\n\nAfter more than a decade in the national political spotlight he had maintained an untarnished image, unlike his troubled 2nd district predecessors Mel Reynolds and , and had challenged Daley on several issues on the local political scene. Jackson supported the  legislation that had been hotly contested in the , and he has been an ardent backer of the  in , placing him at odds with Daley on both issues.

The endorsement was a bitter blow to the hopes of candidate , who had hoped for endorsements from both Jackson and his father.\n\nJackson was a national co-chairman of . As such, he is involved in garnering support from the . During the campaign, he provided the voice for some advertisements such as one  radio ad in which he said: \"Once, South Carolina voted for my father, and sent a strong message to the nation, ... Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president.'\" When describing Obama, he stated that \"Barack Obama is not speaking as a friend of the community; he's part of the community ... He doesn't always tell people what they want to hear. He tells them what they need to hear.'\" During the campaign, he described Obama as the first \"successor\" of  to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate in a way that is unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.\n\nJackson had a lengthy relationship with Obama. Obama's  13th district that he served from 1997 to 2005 was within Jackson's district. Jackson's sister  was a close friend of  and served as a  at the Obama wedding. In 2008, Jackson's father, Jesse Jackson, wrote an  in the '''' attacking presidential candidate Obama for his lack of activist involvement; Jackson Junior responded sharply in the same paper with a defense of Obama.\n\nOn July 6, 2008, Jackson's father said he thought Obama talks down to black people, and unaware he was near a live  offhandedly commented that he would like to \"cut [Obama's] nuts off\". Jackson Junior quickly expressed his outrage at and disappointment in his father's \"ugly rhetoric\". Jackson's father said he was expressing his disappointment in Obama's  speech chastisement of Black fathers.\n\n\nJackson emerged as a possible candidate to replace , who, after being elected President of the United States on November 4, 2008, officially resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate effective November 16.

One early name mentioned, , withdrew her name from consideration and both Davis and Duckworth noted that they had not been contacted by the governor's office by the time Obama announced his resignation on November 13, 2008. In a radio interview on the subject, Jackson cited his record on federal funding for his district, loyalty to Obama and diligence in voting in the U.S. House. At the time, Obama was the only black U.S. Senator, and black leaders pressured Blagojevich to appoint a black successor. The '''' and '''' both endorsed Jackson, who noted that public opinion polls show him as the favorite. The selection was coming at a time when the Governor's public approval ratings were at an all-time low, which added to the pressure for him to make a selection that would be good for his own political perception, and it was believed that Jackson's constituency was one that the Governor might need to appease. Although Obama and Duckworth laid a  together on , Obama did not endorse a successor. However, in an internal report filed by Obama legal advisor , \"Obama authorized Emanuel to pass on the names of four people he considered to be highly qualified to take over his seat – Illinois Comptroller , Illinois Veterans' Affairs Director , Rep.  and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.\"\n\nOn November 27, 2008, Blagojevich hinted that Davis might be his choice. On December 6, the '''' reported that Jackson was among the minority of potential candidates who had not been granted a meeting with Blagojevich on the subject, but two days later Blagojevich granted Jackson a meeting.

Jackson, however, denies any wrongdoing, and says that the U.S. Attorney's office assured him that he is not a target of the investigation. In a press conference, his lawyer confirmed his belief that Jackson is candidate No. 5, but asserted that he has done nothing wrong. Immediately thereafter, in his own news conference, Jackson confirmed that he is a subject and not a target of the investigation and emphatically stated his opposition to \"pay to play\" politics. On December 16, a Jackson spokesperson confirmed special federal investigators have been questioning him since the summer. Also  reported December 15 that Jackson has notified investigators that Blagojevich refused to appoint Sandi Jackson, his wife, as state lottery director because Jackson refused to donate $25,000 to the governor's campaign fund. Jackson spokesman Kenneth Edmonds clarified that although Jackson had been a federal informant for over a decade, never did his cooperation concern the current investigation into the Senate seat.\n\nAlthough Blagojevich's corruption was reported to have been under federal investigation, journalist  of the  allegedly has sources that claim Jackson attributes the Obama replacement case to Obama's neutral stance. According to Fineman's reported source, Jackson felt if Obama had endorsed him, Blagojevich would have selected Jackson. When the scandal first broke, the reaction was that Jackson's reputation was sullied to the point that his viability as a senatorial candidate was diminished. However, reports that Jackson has been a longtime federal information provider has led political allies to continue to speak of his viability as a candidate.

The allegations became the subject of a Congressional ethics investigation.\n\n\nIn December 1999, he co-authored ''It's About the Money: How You Can Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth, and Achieve Your Financial Dreams''. The book is a self-help book with directions for achieving personal financial independence. The book is targeted toward people of limited means. In the fall of 2001, he co-authored ''Legal Lynching: The Death Penalty and America's Future'', also known as ''Legal Lynching II''. With coauthors, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jackson Jr., and Bruce Shapiro, the anti-death penalty voice was heard very publicly. The book was published, at a time when public opposition to the death penalty was at a historically high level, by two of America's most prominent  leaders. It was a follow-up to ''Legal Lynching: Racism, Injustice and the Death Penalty'', which was released in 1996 by Jackson Sr. In 2001, Jackson Jr. authored '''', with his , Frank Watkins.

Dowell commented on the issue, saying: \"The foreclosure process sometimes takes a year or 18 months, two years for them to actually foreclose on the property and sometimes certain banks let those properties sit vacant....They can become haven for gang bangers and drug dealers; there is also the potential for fire hazards.....When vacant buildings are left to deteriorate, local property values tumble and criminality gains an entry into the neighborhood.....The landmark piece of legislation passed today will hold banks responsible for the upkeep of vacant properties, keeping them secure and keeping neighborhoods intact.\" Dowell also stated that: \"This legislation goes a long way to keep our neighborhoods vibrant and soften the negative impact the housing foreclosure process has had on the city.\"\n\nDowell was the recipient of the Independent Voters of Illinois' Best Aldermanic Voting Record for 2010, presented by the  (IVI-IPO), a not-for-profit, multi-partisan, independent political organization that has been in existence since 1944 dedicated to good government activism.

James Hoare converted to Catholicism when he married the Irish-Catholic Mary Alice. In 1959 the family name was changed to \"Haine\". Prior to the change, the four Hoare sons – Jim, John, Bill and Tom – often came to blows with other boys over their phonetically unfortunate surname.\n\nWilliam Haine was first encouraged to take up a career in politics and \"make history\" by Sister Geraldine, an Ursuline nun at St. Patrick's Grade School in Alton. After graduating from Marquette Catholic High School in 1963, he earned his B.A. from St. Louis University in History in 1967. In both high school and college, he became involved in local and state politics, including the races of Alton Mayor Clyde H. Wiseman, State Senator  and U.S. Senator .\n\n\nAfter college, Haine enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve in Vietnam. He was awarded the  for Meritorious Service in Combat Operations after his tour as an enlisted army soldier in the First Cavalry Division (Air Mobile) from 1968 to 1969. He was still politically active while overseas, and from Vietnam he filed as a candidate for Alderman of the City of Alton, losing by only a narrow vote despite being unable to campaign.\n\nAfter his tour overseas, Haine attended St. Louis University Law School, where he served with distinction on the Board of Editors of the St. Louis Law Review and earned his J.D. in 1974. Two professors who mentored him there, Rev. Joseph Aloysius McCallin, S.J., and Dr. George D. Wendell, also encouraged him to pursue a career in politics.\n\n\nDuring his law school years, Haine met Anna Schickel, an undergraduate French major at St. Louis University; they were married on August 7, 1971, in the Grailville Oratory in . Haine and his wife have seven children and 31 grandchildren. They continued to reside in Alton, around the corner from his boyhood home (designed by her father, the artist ). Haine referred to his wedding as the defining moment of his Catholic faith.\n\n\nAfter law school, Haine worked as an assistant public defender and maintained a small general practice on the side. He later partnered with trial attorney Randall Bono, and it was during their years together that Haine was elected a Madison County Board member and then State's Attorney.\n\nAlready a member of the Madison County Board since 1978, Haine first ran for the office of State's Attorney in 1980. In the Democratic primary he faced former Assistant State's Attorney Dick Allen and incumbent State's Attorney Nick Byron. Though he lost the primary by 313 votes in a county of 260,000, Haine had established a Democratic base with the industrial north end of the county. Republican Don W. Weber, a former Assistant State's Attorney, won the general election in the Reagan landslide of 1980.\n\nWith new found political clout from the close primary race, Haine became a leader on the County Board and chaired the newly created Metro-East Transit District. The area-wide public exposure helped make his 1988 run for State's Attorney a success.\n\n\nIn 1988, Haine became State's Attorney for Madison County, Illinois, a post he would hold for 14 years. In late 2002, he was appointed to fill the seat of retiring Senator .\n\n\nAfter serving several months as an appointed Senator, Haine won re-election in 2002. His legislative record has established him as a pro-life, pro-gun and pro-labor legislator. Haine was an early supporter of Obama within the Democratic primary for U.S. Senator in 2004. He was the chairman of the Insurance Committee.\n\nAmong Haine's most controversial bills was the Medical Malpractice Litigation Reform Act, which was supported by hospitals, doctors and nurses but strongly opposed by trial lawyers, including many of his friends in Madison and St. Clair Counties. Haine also was the chief sponsor of the , the law requiring residents to provide identification when purchasing Sudafed, and limiting their purchases of it. Haine also guided the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act through the Illinois Senate, though it has not yet passed the House.\n\nMore recently, Haine designed and sponsored a bill to enhance flood protection along the Mississippi River in his district. Now signed into law, the bill created a new tax district that can issue sales taxes to fund the renovation of local levees. The bill was supported by the Majority and Minority leaders, Democrat  and Republican . Haine has maintained a 100% rating from ..\n\nIn February 2011, Haine introduced a proposed Illinois constitutional amendment effectively banning same-sex marriage in the state. The proposed amendment, which died in a Senate committee, was widely criticized by activists as being \"anti-gay\".\n\nHaine announced he would not seek reelection to a sixth term on August 16, 2017.  won the election to succeed Haine .\n\n\nOn May 16, 2019, Governor  nominated Haine for a position on the  for a term beginning July 1, 2019, and ending June 30, 2023. The Illinois Senate confirmed Haine unanimously on May 31, 2019.\n\n\nHaine was married to his wife Anna for 50 years. He died at age 77 on August 16, 2021. He is survived by his wife, their seven children, and 33 grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\n* at the Illinois General Assembly\n**By session: , , , , , \n* constituency site\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I worked as a lawyer for a year, and had every intention of continuing, but there was pressure from all sides to have a family. Then I had three children in three years and there was no way I could continue to work. So what I did was to get very involved in organizations even when the children were young.

Before becoming mayor, Lightfoot worked in private legal practice as a partner at  and held various government positions in Chicago. She served as president of the  and chair of the . In , Lightfoot defeated  in a runoff election for Chicago mayor. She ran again in  but failed to qualify for the runoff, becoming the city's first incumbent mayor to not be reelected since  in .\n\nLightfoot is the first openly lesbian black woman to serve as mayor of a major city in the United States, and the  (after ) to serve as mayor of one of the ten . She is also the first black woman, the second woman (after Byrne), and the third black person (after  and ) to serve as mayor of Chicago.\n\n\nLightfoot was born in , , the youngest of four children. Her mother, Ann Lightfoot, was a nighttime healthcare aide and school board member, and her father, Elijah Lightfoot, was a local factory worker and janitor. She grew up in a primarily white neighborhood on the west side of the city.\n\nLightfoot is a graduate of  in Massillon, where she was a trumpet player in the school band; sang alto in the choir; played basketball, volleyball, and softball; edited the yearbook; and was a member of the Pep Club. She was elected high school class president three times. When she ran for high school class president, Lightfoot's campaign slogan was \"Get on the right foot with Lightfoot\". Her high school alumni association named her a \"Distinguished Citizen\" in 2013. While in high school, Lightfoot helped organize a boycott of her school's lunch program over the quality of its pizza. Her boycott was a success as the school provided more flavorful pizza. Her punishment for the boycott was detention.\n\nLightfoot received her  in political science from the  in 1984, graduating with honors. She pursued seven different types of employment to pay for her education, including working as a  and as a cook for . She also held factory jobs at home during summers to help pay for her education. While Lightfoot was an undergraduate, her older brother, Brian Lightfoot, was arrested in connection with a bank robbery and the shooting of a security guard.\n\nLightfoot held positions working for Congress members  and  before deciding to attend law school. She has said she chose to attend law school not because of her brother's legal troubles, but because she wanted a job that offered financial independence. She matriculated at the , where she was awarded a full scholarship. As president of the University of Chicago Law School's student body, she led a successful movement to ban a law firm from campus after the firm sent a recruiter who made racist and sexist remarks towards a student. Lightfoot quarterbacked an intramural flag football team while at Chicago Law School. Lightfoot also served as a clerk for Justice  of the . She graduated from the University of Chicago with her  degree in 1989.\n\n\n\nAfter law school, Lightfoot became a practicing attorney at the Mayer Brown law firm, serving a wide cross-section of clients. Lightfoot first entered the public sector as  for the . During her mayoral campaign, Lightfoot cited several reasons for entering public service, including a desire to represent the African-American community, a sense of injustice based on the murder of a family member by a  member in the 1920s, and struggles with the law encountered by her older brother, who was charged with possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.\n\nWhile working as a federal prosecutor, Lightfoot helped to prosecute those accused of federal crimes, including drug crimes. She assisted with , an FBI investigation into Chicago corruption. She helped to convict alderman Virgil Jones. In 1999, Lightfoot was issued a warning for misconduct by judge  in a case in which she was found by the  to have misled a United States Circuit Judge regarding a suspect's whereabouts, making it impossible for the judge to stay the suspect's extradition to Norway. Lightfoot and the Justice Department disputed this characterization of her actions.\n\n\nIn 2002, Lightfoot was appointed chief administrator of the Chicago Police Department Office of Professional Standards, a now-defunct governmental police oversight group, by Police Superintendent Terry Hillard. She held the position for two years. In the position, she was in charge of investigating possible cases of police misconduct, including police shootings of civilians. However, a '''' report found that the Office of Professional Standards' investigations often lacked thoroughness. Lightfoot says her recommendations for disciplinary action were often rejected by the police department.\n\nIn one notable case, Lightfoot went against Police Department orthodoxy by recommending the firing of officer Alvin Weems, who shot and killed an unarmed man, Michael Pleasance. Weems was initially believed to have accidentally shot Pleasance, but after video evidence contradicting the initial claims was revealed, even Weems himself expressed feeling that the shooting was unjustified. Weems was not fired by the Chicago Police Department, but the city was eventually forced to pay a settlement to the Pleasance family. Weems later committed suicide.\n\nIn another controversial case where officer Phyllis Clinkscales shot and killed unarmed 17-year-old Robert Washington, the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that Lightfoot determined that the shooting was justified. In doing so, the Tribune said she reversed the order of her predecessor, who had called for Clinkscales's firing. Clinkscales's account of the events of the shooting had been found to contain untrue statements in an investigation. Lightfoot disputes this account of Clinkscales's case, saying that the police superintendent at the time was responsible for declining Lightfoot's predecessor's finding that the shooting was unjustified. Lightfoot said her action on the case was to push for a 30-day suspension for Clinkscales, which she implied was the most that was possible given the circumstances.\n\n\nLightfoot then moved on to work in the Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications. She was later hired by Mayor  as deputy chief of the Chicago Department of Procurement Services. There, she and her boss, Mary Dempsey, investigated Chicago corruption, drawing Mayor Daley's ire in the process. Lightfoot and Dempsey's investigations included probes of then- 's associate  and prominent Daley donor Elzie Higginbottom. Lightfoot worked at the Department of Procurement Services for a few months, subsequently returning to Mayer Brown. Lightfoot has suggested that she left the Department of Procurement Services because of dismay at corruption in City Hall.\n\n\nAs an attorney at , Lightfoot represented Republicans in two cases contesting supposed Democratic gerrymandering. At Mayer Brown, she also defended Chicago police officer Paul Powers against charges of physical assault. In 2019, after facing criticism over defending Powers, Lightfoot cited video evidence in favor of her former client's innocence.\n\nLightfoot was briefly hired by the city of Chicago to defend the city against charges brought by the family of a mentally ill woman, Christina Eilman, who was brought into custody by Chicago police after suffering a mental breakdown at . Eilman suffered sexual assault and a seven-story fall after being released by police into the dangerous  neighborhood. Eilman's family reached a $22.5 million settlement with the city.\n\nLightfoot has also served on the boards of the Illinois chapters of  and the . She has served as external counsel for . In 2013, Lightfoot was a finalist for the position of  for the Northern District of Illinois, but the job went to .\n\n\n's report in 2016]]\nLightfoot returned to the public sector in 2015, when Mayor  appointed her to replace 19-year incumbent Demetrius Carney as president of the . The board's main responsibility is to make recommendations for or against disciplinary action on certain disputed cases of police misconduct. Under Lightfoot's leadership, the board became more punitive, firing officers in 72% of its cases. In the wake of the controversy over the , Emanuel also appointed Lightfoot as chair of a special . In 2016, the Task Force, led by Lightfoot, filed a report critical of the Chicago Police Department's practices. She specifically criticized the police union's \"code of silence\". The anti-police brutality activist organization 's Chicago chapter released a statement denouncing Lightfoot and the board and task force for a \"lack of accountability\".\n\nIn 2017, Emanuel re-appointed Lightfoot to a second term as president of the Police Board. The decision came after Lightfoot and Emanuel had publicly come into conflict, particularly over Emanuel's attempts to reach a police reform deal with  Justice Department officials that would avoid a  and oversight from a . Lightfoot called Emanuel's approach \"fundamentally flawed\". At the time, there was already speculation that Lightfoot was planning a run for  in 2019, though she denied the rumors. Lightfoot resigned from the Police Board in May 2018, just before announcing her mayoral campaign.\n\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2018, Lightfoot announced her candidacy for mayor of Chicago in the 2019 elections, her first-ever run for public office. Lightfoot is the first openly lesbian candidate in the history of .\n\nBy summer 2018, Lightfoot had the highest-funded campaign of any individual challenging the two-term incumbent mayor, . In the fall, Emanuel dropped out of the race. High-profile candidates such as , , , and  then entered the race.\n\nIn December, after Lightfoot submitted the petitions necessary to secure a place on the ballot, Preckwinkle's campaign filed a challenge claiming that many of Lightfoot's petitions were fraudulent. The Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners found Lightfoot had enough valid petitions to remain on the ballot, and Preckwinkle's campaign withdrew its challenge. In January, the race was upended by a major corruption scandal involving Chicago alderman . Lightfoot ran a television advertisement criticizing Chico, Daley, Mendoza and Preckwinkle as the \"Burke Four\" for their connections to the disgraced alderman.\n\nLightfoot picked up several endorsements, including nods from LGBTQ groups and local politicians. In February, Lightfoot won the endorsement of the '''' editorial board. As close to the election as late January, Lightfoot's support ranged between 2% and 5% in polls. She surged in polls later in the race, consistently polling at or near double-digits in surveys released in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nIn what was considered to be an , Lightfoot finished first in the February election. She placed first in a crowded field of fourteen candidates. Because no candidate reached the necessary 50% of the vote needed to win the election outright, she and Preckwinkle advanced to a runoff election.\n\nIn the runoff, both the ''Sun-Times'' and the ''Chicago Tribune'' endorsed Lightfoot. Several former candidates, including Mendoza, Chico, , and fourth-place finisher  also endorsed Lightfoot in the runoff. Lightfoot held a substantial lead over Preckwinkle in polls conducted during the runoff campaign.\n\nDuring the runoff, Lightfoot faced criticism from criminal justice activists over her record in police accountability and as a prosecutor. Lightfoot defended herself against Bennett's criticisms at a mayoral debate, citing her personal experiences with racial discrimination as evidence she would take the concerns of the black community into account. Lightfoot also faced activist criticism over comments at a  forum where she suggested turning some shuttered schools in the city into police academies. Lightfoot later disavowed this suggestion via Twitter.\n\nIn the runoff, Lightfoot received endorsements from seven of the twelve candidates that had been eliminated in the first round. Preckwinkle, by contrast, received no endorsements at all from any candidates that had been eliminated in the first round.\n\nLightfoot won the runoff election on April 2, 2019, becoming mayor-elect of Chicago. She won more than 73% of the overall vote in the runoff, winning in all 50 wards of the city. Lightfoot won all but 20 of the city's 2,069 voting precincts. Voter turnout was 32.89%, almost a record low.\n\n;Chart of progression of  \n\n\n\nLightfoot's administration faced criticism due to rising crime rates in Chicago and accusations of covering up police misconduct. During her term, she clashed with members of the , the , and  's administration. '''' remarked that she had an \"uncanny ability to make political enemies.\" However, Lightfoot received praise for her efforts to build affordable housing, repair dilapidated areas of the city, and raise the minimum wage.\n  on May 7, 2019]]\n\n\n\nAs mayor-elect, Lightfoot expressed a desire for the  trial to be reexamined, urging the U.S. Attorney's Office to reopen their grand jury investigation to examine if any civil rights were violated.\n\nOn April 6, 2019, Lightfoot told the '''' that her staff would, during her first post-election weekend, spend time examining the city's 600-page agreement with Sterling Bay regarding the . During her campaign, Lightfoot had been critical of the process that was being taken to reach the agreement. The following Monday, at her request, Mayor Rahm Emanuel postponed city council votes on the approval of $1.6 billion in  subsidies for both the Lincoln Yards and  mega-developments. After the developers of the two projects agreed to increase commitments to hiring minority-owned and women-owned contractors, Lightfoot announced her support for the projects, which were approved one day subsequent to her declaration of support.\n\n\nOn May 20, 2019, Lightfoot officially took office as mayor of Chicago after being sworn in at 11:15 am by Magistrate Judge Susan E. Cox of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois at the , accompanied by her wife and daughter. Upon taking office, Lightfoot became the first openly LGBT Chicago mayor, the first black female Chicago mayor, as well as the second female Chicago mayor (after ) and third Chicago black mayor (after  and ).\n\n\nOn October 14, 2019, Lightfoot announced the creation of an affordable housing task force set to consist of 20 members and study solutions to housing affordability over a 4- to 6-month period.  The following month, it was announced that the task force would also come up with a proposal to rewrite the city's affordable housing ordinance. These efforts directly implicated  as the primary issue in housing affordability, recommending an entirely new framework for housing ordinances prioritizing racial equity. However, initial affordable housing goals were set back by budget shortfalls due to the . Many of these recommendations were eventually integrated into the distribution of federal relief funds for housing assistance grants, as well as allocations for low-income tax credits.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, Lightfoot named Tracey Scott as . On March 30, the CHA Board of Commissioners approved Tracey Scott's appointment.\n\n\n\nAfter legislation expanding  in Illinois was passed by the state legislature at the start of June 2019, Lightfoot announced that the city would commence a study of where a Chicago  would be located. Lightfoot's predecessors had long sought to obtain a casino for the city. While the state did not approve a city-owned casino (reportedly preferred by Lightfoot, as it had been by her predecessors); state legislation allowed for a privately owned casino from which the city would receive one-third of tax revenue generated. Lightfoot continued to push, however, for the state to authorize a casino jointly owned by the city and state and with a lesser effective tax rate than the passed legislation specified.\n\nOn May 5, 2022, Lightfoot announced that she had selected a bid from the  to construct a  on the west bank of the .\n\n\nIn July 2020, Lightfoot directed that a statue of Christopher Columbus be removed from Grant Park. After the murder of George Floyd, protesters had attempted to knock over the statue and had engaged in a violent confrontation with police.\n\nIn March 2022, attorney George Smyrniotis sued Lightfoot for defamation. The lawsuit claimed that Italian-Americans were unhappy with the removal of the Columbus statue, and that a tentative deal had been struck to assuage their concerns by allowing the statue to be displayed in an annual Columbus Day parade. According to Smyrniotis, Lightfootangry over the proposal regarding the display of the statuesuggested during a Zoom call that she would revoke the parade permit if the statue were to be displayed. Smyrniotis added that Lightfoot had questioned his competence, berated him and others with obscenities, and asserted that she had \"'the biggest d*** in Chicago'\". For her part, Lightfoot contended that the lawsuit's \"'deeply offensive and ridiculous claims'\" were \"'wholly lacking in merit'\".\n\n\n  in 2022]]\nLightfoot's first executive order as mayor limited \"aldermanic prerogative\", a practice under which  were granted an effective veto over matters in their wards.\n\nOn May 28, 2019, Lightfoot unveiled proposals to revise the  operating rules. Among other things, she proposed live streaming video of committee meetings, changes to strengthen the rule on , and the transfer of control over  subsidies to the council's Committee on Economic and Capital Development.\n\nOn May 31, 2019, after indictments were brought against Alderman , Lightfoot called for his resignation.\n\nOn June 5, 2019, Lightfoot outlined further ethics reform proposals for the city council.\n\n\n\nDuring the , Lightfoot took a number of actions aimed at quelling the severity of the outbreak in Chicago.  On March 11, 2020, Lightfoot joined Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker to postpone of the city's formal  festivities (including parades and the ).  On March 15, Lightfoot decided that, due to concerns surrounding Saint Patrick's Day festivities, all businesses selling liquor must have less than half of their regular maximum capacity, and must additionally not exceed a capacity of 100 people.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, Lightfoot again joined Pritzker to issue, among other things, a ban on events attended by more than 1,000 people from being held over the next 30 days.\n\nOn March 15, Lightfoot criticized the long lines at Chicago's  as a result of federal government  as \"utterly unacceptable\". Under the federal government's travel restrictions, authorized passengers could only take flights from 26 permitted European nations to a total of thirteen permitted United States airports, of which O'Hare was one.\n\n.]]\nLightfoot's administration supplemented the state response with municipal public health measures, and the mayor leveraged the visibility of her office to promote adherence. On March 20, 2020, Lightfoot extended Chicago Public School closures beyond the Illinois state mandate. Chicago's Department of Health Commissioner, Dr. Allison Arwady, signed a public health order prohibiting residents diagnosed with or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 from leaving their place of residence for work or other public gatherings. The order made exceptions for sick residents seeking essential services, such as clinical care, medicine, and food. Lightfoot declared that those found to be in violation of this order could be issued a citation. On March 27, Lightfoot also placed a ban on s and closed the city's parks, beaches, and trails due to recent instances of residents gathering in public places in breach of the state's . On April 8, Lightfoot introduced a  on liquor sales in an attempt to curb crowds congregating outside liquor stores. Lightfoot even directly participated in the enforcement of the state's stay-at-home order, personally patrolling the city and confronting violators. This no-nonsense approach to enforcing COVID-19 restrictions inspired a series of Lightfoot-centric s that first gained popularity in late March.\n\nLightfoot also endorsed proactive public health measures. On March 31, 2020, Lightfoot announced that she had secured 300 hotel rooms in the city's downtown to house first responders, which they could use so that they would not need to go to their homes and risk spreading  to their families, and her administration worked with the  to establish a makeshift  at . On April 7, Lightfoot signed an executive order affirming the eligibility of undocumented immigrants for city benefits and services, including COVID-19 relief, although such protections were already guaranteed under the Welcoming City Ordinance passed under the previous administration. Lightfoot also partnered with Chicago's professional sports teams to launch the \"We Are Not Playing\" advertisement campaign.\n\n work to convert  into a makeshift ]]\n\n\nIn early April, Lightfoot began to draw criticism for perceived hypocrisy and opacity in relation to the city's pandemic response. When Lightfoot was found to have gotten her hair cut in violation of the state's stay-at-home order, she argued that she was justified in doing so, saying, \"I'm the public face of this city. I'm on national media and I'm out in the public eye.\" Lightfoot also courted controversy in defending her support for the suspension of  response deadlines. The mayor invoked the  to contend that FOIA requests diverted municipal employees from lifesaving duties: \"I'm mindful of the fact that we're in the  season, the angel of death that we all talk about is the Passover story, that angel of death is right here in our midst every single day.\" In response, the  group  awarded Lightfoot  the tongue-in-cheek \"Pharaoh Prize for Deadline Extensions.\" Lightfoot was further scrutinized for her decision to issue new restrictions, including a stay-at-home advisory, on November 12, as she had been seen days earlier at a large gathering celebrating 's election victory.\n\n\nAs mayor-elect, Lightfoot opposed state legislation that would create a 21-member school board, calling it \"unwieldy\". (Lightfoot had previously advocated for an elected Chicago school board.) Nevertheless, in July 2021, governor  signed such legislation over Lightfoot's objections.\n\n\nOn November 23, 2019, a plan by Lightfoot to increase the  to $15 an hour by 2021 was approved by the Chicago City Council. This increase did not include restaurant servers and tipped workers.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Lightfoot proposed a   for commercial real estate sales. Under this proposal, the city would capture more money from large real estate transfers while also providing a tax break for most transfers valued under $500,000.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the Chicago City Council approved Lightfoot's budget for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\n\n\nShortly after taking office, Lightfoot faced what was regarded as her first test at preserving public safety. In prior years, violence had often increased over  weekend in Chicago. In an attempt to eschew this pattern, Lightfoot initiated ''Our City. Our Safety'', under which extra police patrols were stationed in busy locations and troubled spots, and free youth programs were organized by the Chicago Park District at about a hundred locations. A notable extent of the violence was still witnessed over the weekend, to which Lightfoot responded, \"We can't claim victory and we certainly can't celebrate. We have much more work to do.\"\n\nOn May 28, 2019, Lightfoot outlined a plan to focus on reducing the city's gun violence. On May 28, 2019, Lightfoot urged the city council to pass an ordinance within her first hundred days that would establish a level of civilian oversight on the Chicago Police Department.\n\nLightfoot launched a  initiative in June 2019. Later that month she announced that the city's police department would not assist  (ICE) raids, denying ICE access to the city's police database in an effort to prevent the city's illegal immigrant population from facing .\n\n in 2022]]\nOn November 8, 2019, after  announced that he would resign from his position as superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, Lightfoot named  to serve as interim superintendent of the Chicago Police Department. On December 2, rather than letting Johnson voluntarily retire, Lightfoot fired him due to what she declared were \"intolerable\" actions by him and him misleading the public. Lightfoot nominated  to be superintendent of police on April 2, 2020. After Beck stepped down on April 15, Brown became acting superintendent, while pending confirmation to serve on a permanent basis.\n\nOn November 13, 2019, Lightfoot proposed an ordinance that would create a new Office of Public Safety Administration, which would combine administrative functions of Chicago Police Department, the Chicago Fire Department and the Office of Public Safety Administration.\n\nIn June 2020, Lightfoot voiced her opposition to an ordinance proposed by alderman , which would end the Chicago Public Schools' contract to station Chicago Police Department officers at schools.\n\nIn May 2021, Lightfoot nominated Annette Nance-Holt to be the . She was confirmed to the position by the Chicago City Council on June 23. Nance-Holt is the first woman to serve in a permanent capacity as the commissioner of the Chicago Fire Department.

In response to the city's third mass shooting in four days, Lightfoot said: \"We are part of a club of cities to which no one wants to belong: cities with mass shootings.\"\n\n\nDuring the 2020  (BLM)  sparked by the , Lightfoot, who campaigned as a police reformer, stated that police unions have continued to be one of the main obstacles to reform of the department:\n\n\n\nLightfoot further stated that police violence and brutality \"demean the badge\" and asked the public to report police misconduct.\n\nOn May 31, during a conference call with all 50 Chicago aldermen, Lightfoot got into a heated argument with fellow Democrat  of the 15th Ward. The two swore at one another after Lopez criticized the mayor's response to looting and rioting during the .\n\nIn August 2020, she came under criticism for not allowing protests on the block where she lives. Lightfoot said this was justified because she had received threats.\n\n\nOn May 19, 2021, Lightfoot stated she would only choose  for interviews on the occasion of her two-year anniversary in office. This sparked considerable backlash, with many calling for her resignation, including .  sued Lightfoot on behalf of '''', alleging that Lightfoot violated journalist Thomas Catenacci's  and  rights.\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, it was announced by Lightfoot that Chicago residents would be able to apply to participate in the city's $500-per-month basic income pilot program in April of that year. The pilot program was offered to Chicago residents who suffered economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, giving them the chance to  enter into a lottery to get $500 monthly payments for the course of one year. The pilot program was for 5,000 participants and had the requirements of: the applicant must live in Chicago, be at least 18 years old, have experienced economic hardship related to COVID-19, and have a household income at or below 250% of the federal poverty level. It was stated to be the largest universal basic income pilot program in the U.S. to date.\n\n\n\nIn the 2023 Chicago mayoral election, a wide field of nine challengers qualified for the ballot. Polling of the race was largely inconsistent, but indicated that Lightfoot was in danger of losing re-election and that the candidates with the best chance of making a runoff were Lightfoot, U.S. Representative ,  commissioner , former  CEO , and businessman .\n\nLightfoot faced controversy when she emailed public school teachers offering school credit for students who interned on her campaign and when she told  residents to either vote for her or not vote at all. Lightfoot ran ads tying García to  and  and accusing Johnson of wanting to reduce police budgets.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, Lightfoot finished in third place out of nine candidates. Therefore, she failed to qualify for the run-off election of the top two candidates. She garnered 16.81% of the vote, while Paul Vallas and Brandon Johnson received 32.90% and 21.63%, respectively. Johnson prevailed in the April 4, 2023 runoff. Lightfoot was the only of the seven eliminated candidates not to endorse either Johnson or Vallas ahead of the runoff.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a table of polls on Lightfoot's approval rating among Chicagoans, descending from most to least recent:\n\n\n\n\n: 6% \"strongly approve\", 19% \"somewhat approve\", 25% \"somewhat disapprove\", 48% \"strongly disapprove\", and 2% \"not sure\".\n\n\nAfter losing her bid for re-election as mayor of Chicago, Lightfoot began teaching a course (titled \"Health Policy and Leadership\") as a Menschel Senior Leadership Fellow at 's .\n\n\nOn March 6, 2020, shortly before the , Lightfoot endorsed 's  for president.\n\nLightfoot appeared in a video shown on the opening night of the  which also features Biden,  Police Chief , activist , activist , and  President .\n\nLightfoot was a  Democratic  elector from Illinois, casting her votes for Biden as president and  as vice-president.\n\n\nLightfoot resides in the  neighborhood, on 's .

She also worked as a strategic planner for the  and as a consultant at .\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Steans introduced a  bill (SB 2468) which introduces civil marriages in Illinois and allows religious institutions the right to decline marrying same sex couples. SB \n2468 states, \"nothing in the Act should be construed to interfere or regulate any religious practice concerning marriage and no religion is required to solemnize a marriage to which it objects\".\nIn 2013, Steans sponsored the  bill that was signed into law.

The law sets higher nursing home quality and staffing requirements, raises penalties for violations, and increases inspections and monitoring.\"\n\nSteans also partnered with a formal political rival, Suzanne Elder, to pass anti-discrimination legislation. Working together, she and Elder faced formidable opposition from the state's teachers' unions and overrode an amendatory veto from Governor Quinn to enact legislation that protects the health and civil rights of students with diabetes and other disabilities (''The Care of Students with Diabetes Act,'' P.A. 96–1485).\n\nIn 2012, Heather Steans sponsored the \"Save Medicaid Access and Resources Together Act\" (SMART Act), which saved Illinois $1.6&nbsp;billion in Medicaid costs by increasing the efficiency of the program.\nSteans also passed a law that allowed Illinois to enact Medicaid expansion under the .\n\nIn 2018 Heather Seans was the lead sponsor in the Senate to restrict Illinoisans' access to non-Obamacare compliant healthcare plans in an attempt to force them into much more expensive Obamacare compliant health insurance plans.\n\n\nSteans sponsored Illinois' Equal Pay Act of 2012, which holds individuals liable for wage discrimination on the basis of gender.\nSteans has led the fight to have Illinois ratify the , which passed the Illinois State Senate.

Steans believes that independent maps would help \"restore faith in our political system,\" in Illinois.\n\n\nAs Chair of the Senate Appropriations I committee, Steans has worked to resolve Illinois budget impasse with Governor  and the General Assembly.

He was the first member of the  born in the 1980s as well as the first millennial member of Congress; when he took his seat in 2009 he was the , at age 27. Previously, Schock had served two terms in the , also as its .\n\nSchock resigned from Congress in March 2015 amid a scandal involving his use of public and campaign funds. A subsequent Congressional ethics investigation revealed that he used taxpayer money to fund \"lavish\" trips and events.Theodore Schleifer and Pamela Brown, , CNN (November 10, 2016). In November 2016, a federal grand jury indicted him in connection with the scandal. After he pled not guilty, prosecutors reached a  with him in March 2019 whereby all charges were dropped in return for a period of good behavior and payment of $100,000 in restitution. As part of the deal, Schock's campaign committee, Schock for Congress, also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of failing to properly report expenses.\n\nDespite having a voting record of consistently opposing  rights, Schock  in March 2020 and expressed regret for some of his previous policy decisions.\n\n\nSchock was born in , the youngest of the four children of Janice Marie (née Joos), a homemaker, and Richard Schock, a family practice physician and former school board member. During his early years, the family lived on a rural farm site where the children were given the responsibility of tending a three-acre patch of strawberries and selling the fruit. When he was in fourth grade, his family moved to . In 1995, he was elected to the executive board of the Illinois Association of Junior High Student Councils.\n\nSchock attended . By his junior year of high school, he had completed nearly all of his graduation requirements, and had few course options available because the school district had recently discontinued most of the  and other advanced courses due to budget cuts. School district policy did not allow him to graduate early, and the board members refused his requests to change the policy. He began attending classes at  in , earning dual credits toward high school and college graduation. He graduated from high school in 2000.\n\nSchock received his  degree from  in 2002, with a major in finance.\n\n\nSchock decided to run for the Peoria  a few months after graduating from high school because he felt the board needed a more diverse and youthful perspective. After he did not get on the ballot because he did not have the required number of valid signatures on his petition to run for office, he organized a successful write-in campaign, using more than 200 volunteers who visited more than 13,000 households. He defeated the incumbent with 57% of the vote; at age 19, he was the youngest person serving on a school board in Illinois.\n\nOn July 2, 2003, his fellow board members elected him vice president of the board, on a vote of 4–3. On July 2, 2004, his fellow board members unanimously elected him school board president, making him, at 23, the youngest school board president in Illinois history.\n\n\nAt the age of 23, Schock ran for a seat in the . In the November 2004 general election, he defeated four-term incumbent  , by just 235 votes out of 40,000 ballots cast, and became the youngest member of the  in state history. Five months after taking the office, he resigned from the school board to focus on his job as a state legislator.\n\nWhen Schock ran for reelection in 2006, he defeated Democrat Bill Spears, winning 58 percent of the total vote. He received more than 40 percent of the African-American vote in his district, despite his opposition to race-based . During his four years in the state legislature, Schock served on two appropriations committees that were typically reserved for more senior lawmakers, as well as the Financial Institutions, Environment & Energy and Veteran's Affairs committees.\n\nSchock was the chief sponsor of 38 bills, of which 13 became law. The bills dealt with education, child protection, prescription drug savings, veterans' assistance, road construction and high-tech identity theft. Another bill, co-sponsored with Democrat , expanded the taxation area for the .\n\nDuring his time in the state legislature, Schock was involved with Youth for a Cause, Peoria Mayor's Vision 2020, the Peoria Chamber of Commerce, Heart of Illinois Kids Count, St. Jude Telethon V.I.P. and medical mission trips to  and .\n\nDuring his second term as state representative, Schock worked as Director of Development and Construction for Petersen Companies of Peoria, \n\n\n of , Illinois, in 2009]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his speech announcing his candidacy for , to succeed retiring incumbent Republican congressman , Schock said,\n\"If China continues to be irresponsible about nuclear proliferation in Iran, we should tell them that ... we will sell Pershing nuclear missiles to Taiwan for their defense. Nonproliferation will either be enforced universally or not at all – it is their choice. The Chinese will come around, I have no doubt.\" His campaign manager described the policy as \"well thought out\" and Schock first defended the remarks, but Schock later said it was \"more in jest\" and that he had made a mistake.\n\nSchock easily won the Republican primary in February 2008, with 72% of the vote, beating his opponents Jim McConoughey (16%) and John Morris (12%).\n\n]]\nSchock drew mixed reaction in late July 2008 when he brought President  to Peoria to raise money for his congressional campaign. The city of Peoria provided 38 police officers, 30 city trucks for temporary security barriers, and a number of firefighters, spending $38,252 to facilitate the visit, even though it was a private, paid-admission fundraiser. When requests to compensate the city increased, Schock called it \"obviously a political move\" and compared the issue to 's endorsement of another state senator on the courthouse steps a few years before, for which the city did not request compensation. A city councilman cited an ordinance against political activity by the city, but the mayor of Peoria, , called the requests \"political rhetoric\" and said the ordinance did not apply, and that the city did not have a policy addressing a situation where a sitting president visits. Schock later said he would reimburse the city voluntarily, referring to payment for presidential protection as \"unprecedented\", and saying he believed his campaign was the first in the state and possibly the nation to repay a city for protective services provided to a president.\n\nSchock spoke at the .\n\nPrior to the general election, Schock was endorsed by 116 mayors across the district and the . Schock's hometown newspaper, the , endorsed Schock \"on the basis of his potential.\"\n\nIn October 2008, Schock's father testified in a federal court that his son had notarized documents with false dates (a Class A misdemeanor under the Illinois Notary Public Act) while helping his parents establish tax shelters.\n\nSchock won the 2008 general election with 59% of the vote, defeating Democratic candidate  and Green Party candidate . He was only the fifth person to serve the district since 1933. Upon taking his seat in Congress, at the age of 27, he became the , supplanting 33-year-old  of North Carolina, and the first member of Congress born in the 1980s.\n\nIn the November 2008 election, Democrat  won Schock's 92nd Representative District seat in the .\n\n\n\nIn November 2010, Schock was challenged by Democrat D. K. Hirner, the Executive Director of the Illinois Environmental Regulatory Group and the Green Party nominee Sheldon Schafer. The  again endorsed Schock, writing, \"Schock is a more self-assured, well-rounded candidate than he was two years ago.\" The endorsement noted that Schock had voted with President Barack Obama more than a third of the time, breaking with GOP leaders on multiple issues, from his support for renewable energy to taming predatory lenders to FDA regulation of tobacco. Schock won with 59% of the vote.\n\n\n\nFor 2012, it appeared that Schock would face Darrel Miller in the Republican primary, but Miller was removed from the ballot in February 2012 due to problems with his petition signatures. In the general election, Schock faced Democrat Steve Waterworth. Redistricting made Schock's district much safer. Most of the more Democratic portions of Peoria were cut out, replaced with Republican-leaning  and . On paper, the new 18th was now the second-most Republican district in Illinois; had the district existed in 2008,  would have carried it with 60.7 percent of the vote. By comparison, McCain had carried the old 18th with just over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nIn April 2012, watchdog groups filed a complaint with the , claiming that Schock violated federal campaign rules when he solicited a $25,000 donation from House Majority Leader  for use in a Republican primary. Schock's campaign stated that it believed the FEC would dismiss the complaint after review. In December 2012, the  confirmed that the same matter had been referred to it by the . In February 2013, the Office of Congressional Ethics' report was publicly released, which stated there was \"substantial reason to believe that Rep. Schock violated federal law, House rules and standards of conduct.\" At the time of the release, Schock's communications director released a statement saying: \"The release by the Ethics Committee of this report from the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) is just one more step in the long process of adjudicating ethics complaints that can be submitted by anyone for any reason. We remain firmly convinced that Congressman Schock will be exonerated when the Ethics Committee examines the complaint and in due course resolves this matter.\"\n\nQuestions have also been raised about a real estate transaction that occurred the month before the 2012 elections. Schock sold his Peoria home to a major Republican donor, who was also one of his campaign supporters, for a price that appeared to far exceed its then market value, and reported as three times its worth. This led to another ethics complaint being filed against Schock by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nSchock was endorsed by the editorial board of '''', who wrote that Schock \"has grown in his two terms in the House, building expertise on budget, trade, transportation and agriculture issues and reaching across the aisle at times to build a solid record.\" Schock was also endorsed by the '''' and the ''''.\n\nSchock defeated Waterworth to win reelection in 2012, winning 74% of the vote.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the 2012 election, there was speculation about Schock's ambitions for higher political office, including a '''' article noting that Schock's new district in central Illinois had been drawn, during redistricting after the 2010 census, to be very safe, leading to suggestions that Democrats were trying to keep him happy in the House and away from any statewide bid. An Illinois Republican was quoted as saying, \"I think he would be the top candidate on the Republican side if  retired or if he wanted to run for governor. His ability to fundraise and be popular with conservatives without coming across as an ideologue would suit him well if he chooses to run.\" In November 2012, it was reported that Schock had met with officials at the  to explore the possibility of running for  in 2014. However, in April 2013, Schock announced that he would not be running for governor, and would instead be seeking election to a fourth term in Congress.\n\nSchock won the November 2014 general election with 75% of the vote, defeating Democrat Darrel Miller.\n\n\nTwo weeks after taking office in 2009, Schock proposed an amendment, which passed, to the  Accountability Act, to create a searchable website so Americans could see where bailout funds were being spent. The act's sponsor, Democrat , said \"this is a very thoughtful amendment and it will greatly enhance things.\"\n\nIn February 2009, President  invited Schock to fly with him on  for a visit to a  plant in . During the visit, Obama appealed to Schock to support the  which was up for a vote the next day in Congress, but Schock ultimately voted against the legislation.\n\nDuring his first year in Congress, Schock sponsored more passed legislation than any other Republican freshman. In 2010 he secured $40.7 million in funding for Illinois.\n\nOn February 28, 2013, Schock reintroduced the , a bill that would instruct the  to study the  in Illinois to evaluate the national significance of the area and to determine the feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System. Schock had previously introduced similar legislation in the 111th United States Congress ().\n\nSchock and Rep.  jointly introduced the  on April 29, 2013. The bill would amend the , with respect to minimum essential health care coverage requirements added by the , to allow an additional religious exemption from such requirements for individuals whose sincerely held religious beliefs would cause them to object to medical health care provided under such coverage. Individuals could file an affidavit to get this exemption, but would lose the exemption if they went on to later use healthcare. Schock and Keating wrote a letter in support of their bill saying, \"we believe the EACH Act balances a respect for religious diversity against the need to prevent fraud and abuse.\"\n\nIn December 2013, Schock was selected by House Speaker  to lead the congressional delegation to the . Schock was the only current Republican House of Representatives member in the delegation and only other seated Republican Congressman other than Texas Senator .\n\n\nSchock was considered to be more  than his two moderate predecessors, Congressmen  and . The '''', in their endorsements for the 2008 general election, described Schock's political positions to be  and somewhat moderate on social issues. Nevertheless, he has said he would have supported the financial bailout plan, or the , that passed Congress in October 2008 and he did not support the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" in 2010. Schock is a former member of the  and the . Schock has said \"our strategy with young people needs to be economic issues\", and that social issues are \"not what compelled me to run for office.\"\n\nIn their 2010 endorsement of Schock, the '''' wrote, \"We've not always seen eye to eye with Schock, but he has been far more influential than your average freshman. He's a hard worker, a rising star in the Republican Party...We have long valued independence in our congressmen; Aaron Schock is a conservative, but he also has a mind of his own, and he is endorsed.\"\n\nSchock endorsed  in the , and he appeared with Romney at campaign events.\n\n\nSchock voted against the $787 billion stimulus plan in February 2009.

To do so, the legislation would take away eligibility for those tax credits from people who aren't students or who \"did not attend an eligible institution\", according to ''''.\n\n\nSchock voted for the .\n\n\n*''''''\n** \n** \n*''''''\n** \n** \n\nDuring his first term, Schock requested and was given three committee assignments. In addition, he was appointed by   to be a deputy minority whip. He served as  of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology of the Small Business Committee. Soon after being sworn in to serve his first term, he joined the , \"a home for deficit hawks\", according to the ''Los Angeles Times''. As of April 2012, he is no longer a member of the Republican Study Committee. Schock was a member of the , a group of moderate Republicans who advocate reducing the deficit, cutting taxes, and focusing on education and environmental issues.\n\nAt the beginning of his second term in 2011, Schock was appointed to the . On the committee he served on the ,  and . The Subcommittee on Trade has oversight over reciprocal trade agreements including multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations and implementation of agreements involving tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2015, '''' reported that Schock's congressional offices had been lavishly redecorated in a style inspired by the aristocratic homes in the television show ''''. In response to that story, the watchdog group  (CREW) filed a complaint alleging Schock could have received an improper gift. CREW's executive director, Anne Weismann, stated, \"Again and again, Rep. Schock's seeming obsession with his image impedes his ability to conduct himself in [an] ethical manner.\" Schock dismissed the criticism with the statement \"Haters gonna hate\", which was in turn criticized for its apparent flippancy. Schock later stated he intended to pay the decorator. Another investigation had discovered he had spent campaign money on workout DVDs.\n\nFurther media scrutiny of congressional expenditure reports showed that Schock had spent over $100,000 in government funds on office decorating and renovations between January 2009 and late 2014, mostly during his first term. In 2015, news company  reported Schock had charged thousands of dollars for private flights, legal expenses, new cars, tickets to the  and Country Music Awards, as well as cufflinks, massage, \"gold equipment\" and cigars to his government-funded office account. The  accessed the location metadata on Schock's  photos and correlated it with private flight records to identify flights that did not correspond to his campaign finance disclosures. In response, Schock's office stated it had begun an internal review of the reimbursements.\n\nIn March 2015 there were further reports of spending and disclosure irregularities, including that Schock had accepted money from an outside group, the , to cover the cost of bringing a photographer on an all-expenses-paid trip to India organized to discuss sanitation and access to clean water. The Associated Press also reported that much of Schock's personal wealth had been built with the assistance of political donors. Conservative commentators began calling for Schock's replacement. '''' called him \"a crook\" and stated: \"Politics shouldn't be a ticket to a celebrity lifestyle on the public's dime. For a man who has enjoyed such a short and undistinguished career, Illinois's Representative Aaron Schock (R) has sure packed in a lot of corruption.\"\n\nOn March 16, '''' reported that Schock had requested the federal government and his campaign reimburse him for a total of 170,000 miles that were driven on his personal car, a Chevrolet Tahoe, between January 2010 and July 2014. But when he transferred that car back to the dealer in July 2014, he signed documents saying it had only been driven 80,000 miles. A subsequent investigation by the '''' of reimbursements on Schock's previous vehicle, a , revealed a similar discrepancy. He bought the Envoy in 2007 while still in the state house. The Envoy had 24,300 miles on its odometer when he bought it. When he sold it in 2009, he'd put an additional 53,100 miles on it in a little over two years. However, during 2009 he billed the federal government and his campaign for a total of 42,300 miles.\n\nOn March 17, 2015, Schock announced his resignation from Congress, effective March 31, 2015. The resignation came less than 12 hours after the ''Politico'' report about the questionable reimbursements went online. On the day he announced his resignation, his spokesman said that Schock had refunded all reimbursements he had received for mileage on his car. By resigning, he avoided an impending congressional ethics inquiry. On March 20, the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that federal investigators had opened a \"preliminary investigation\" into the activities of Schock. In October 2016, Schock agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty to the  for having asked Rep.  to contribute $25,000 to pay for advertisements for Rep. .\n\n\nOn November 10, 2016, the  for the  announced that a  had indicted Schock on 24 criminal counts including theft of government funds, fraud,  and filing false tax returns. The charges arose in connection with the spending scandal.\n\nSchock pleaded not guilty to all charges when arraigned on December 12, 2016. A trial date was set for July 11, 2017. In March 2017, Schock's attorneys, led by  of , filed public documents criticizing activities of an FBI confidential informant, a former Schock staffer enlisted after Schock's indictment. On May 19, 2017, Judge  set a new trial date for January 22, 2018, but the trial was delayed again in November 2017. On October 23, 2017, Judge Bruce dismissed two of the 24 counts against Schock, but denied Schock's motion to dismiss the entire indictment. On May 30, 2018, the  affirmed the district court's denial of Schock's motion to dismiss the entire indictment and dismissed his appeal.\n\nOn June 26, 2018, Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Bass was removed from the Schock case after being accused of lying to the jury about Schock being subpoenaed to testify when he wasn't, and that was followed, in mid-August 2018, by Judge Bruce being bumped from all of his criminal cases for commenting in emails about an unrelated trial he was overseeing, thus causing the U.S. Department of Justice to transfer the case to Judge  who, on August 30, 2018, was informed by U.S. Attorney for the Central District of Illinois John Childress that the Justice Department was replacing the prosecutors overseeing the Schock case, that were not named, other than Childress noting that the new prosecution team would be from outside of the Central District of Illinois.\n\nIn March 2019, prosecutors reached an agreement with Schock suspending the case for six months and requiring him to be under court supervision. If he stayed out of legal troubles all charges against him would be dropped in six months in exchange for him paying $42,000 to the IRS and $68,000 to his congressional campaign fund. As part of the deal, Schock's campaign committee, Schock for Congress, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of failing to properly report expenses. The six months probationary period ended in September 2019, and all charges against Schock were dropped. \n\n\nAccording to '''', Schock has \"cultivated an image that is more about lifestyle and less about lawmaking.\" Schock was selected \"hottest freshman\" congressman in a February 2009 reader poll on ''''. Schock had been frequently targeted by  reporters since his arrival in Washington. Schock told 's '''' that such soft media coverage could increase voters' interest in politics. \"People who watch TMZ or different mediums don't expect to see their congressman on such a show\", he said. \"To see their hometown congressman on a show like this kind of raises their interest and gets them a little excited.\"\n\nIn 2009, Schock appeared on '''', during which the host, &nbsp;– making fun of the TMZ reports &nbsp;– \"grilled\" Schock about his \"six-pack abs\". Schock went on to appear on the cover of the June 2011 issue of '''', which one commentator decried as evidence of \"a narcissism that never rests\". Schock appeared on  (2010) of '''', a competition  program, as a guest judge.\n\nIn 2012, Schock told '''' that \"I'm a big believer if you want to change people's minds or get someone to vote for you, either a voter or a colleague, you've got to first get their attention. If people don't know who you are, they're not going to listen to your message. And not everybody pays attention to politicians by watching  and .\" In May 2013, Schock was nominated for and included in a '''' magazine poll titled \"Who's the Most Influential ?\"\n\n\nSince 2004, media outlets have questioned Schock's  in relation to his  voting record. In an interview with '''' in 2009, Schock said that he was not .\n\nIn January 2014, journalist Itay Hod made a post on his personal  page accusing an unknown Republican congressman from Illinois of voting against , while showering with his male roommate and visiting s.

In June 2019, a video was released showing Schock  a male  at a gay bar in . In October 2019, Schock was seen and photographed at a dance party for gay men in . Schock's actions drew condemnation from gay rights activists due to his past political stances and votes on gay issues.}}\n\nSchock  as gay in an Instagram post on March 5, 2020, as well as in a statement posted on his website. In his statement, Schock expressed regret for some of his stances and attributed his voting record to his estrangement from his socially conservative family and struggles to come to terms with his sexual orientation.

In 1953 he graduated from  in  with a B.S. in business administration.\n\n\nIn 1953, Stroger relocated to  and became active in the  organization in the . After only a year, Stroger was appointed as an assistant auditor in the . Stroger then served as personnel director at the  from 1955 to 1961. Stroger attended  at the  and graduated in 1965. While earning a law degree he worked for the financial director of the State of Illinois. In 1968, Stroger was elected 8th Ward .\n\n\nIn 1970, Stroger was elected to the  as one of several members representing Chicago. (at the time, ten members were elected to represent Chicago , while another seven members were elected to represent suburban Cook County at-large).\n\nIn his time on the county board, Stroger spent time as a chair of every major committee (including finance, health, building and zoning). He sponsored legislation on the committee aimed at assisting minority- and female-owned businesses.\n\nIn 1980, Stroger unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination in  against incumbent .

The 1994 election was the first in which board members were elected to represent , and Stroger was elected to represent the .\n\nAs president, ultimately Stroger completed much of what he set out to do when he campaigned in 1994. This included balancing the county's $2.9 billion budget. He also instituted a Juvenile Drug Court, appointed a Commission on Women's Issues and opened a new  treatment and research facility. Stroger served on the Chicago Metropolitan Healthcare Council and the board of South Shore Hospital. The new Cook County Hospital was renamed the  after Stroger while he was serving as county board president.\n\nIn the 1990s, he was appointed by U.S. President  to serve as a member of the .\n\n\nIn the Democratic primary of the 1994 county board presidential election, Stroger defeated two opponents.

Stroger supporters counterclaimed that he dedicated his public career to providing quality and affordable health care for the poorer residents of Cook County.\n\n\n, Stroger initially sought a fourth term as county president and as a board member. For president, was challenged in the Democratic primary by Cook County Commissioner . Claypool who ran as a reform candidate, and accused Stroger of presiding over a \"bloated\" government.\n\nThe 2006 election was among the most controversial in the colorful history of Cook County politics.

The severity of Stroger's condition was concealed from voters both before the primary election and for three months thereafter, possibly allowing his primary victory and preventing independent opposition to the replacement Democratic candidate in the general election.

He was first put on the political map in the late 1970s by leading a petition to amend the 1970  with the \"Illinois Initiative\". This amendment was intended to increase the power of public  in the political process and recalls for public officials. The petition drive was successful, but the  ultimately ruled that the Illinois Initiative was an \"unconstitutional constitutional amendment,\" and thus never was presented to voters.\n\nQuinn drew more attention to his causes by holding press conferences on Sundays, seen as a slow news day. While still in law school, Quinn scored his first political success in 1980, earning a reputation as a reformer on the Illinois political scene. Through his organization, \"The Coalition for Political Honesty,\" he initiated and led the statewide campaign for the  to the , ultimately reducing the size of the  from 177 to 118 members.\n\n\n \nIn 1982, Quinn was elected as commissioner of the Cook County Board of Appeals (now known as the ). Quinn was regarded as a positive reforming figure on the Board of Appeals, which was long (before his tenure and subsequent to his departure) regarded to be plagued by . The board had long resisted awarding excessive s to politically-connected wealthy individuals, as the board had long done. During his first year, this largely resulted in tax rebates awarded by the board decreasing from $444 million in the preceding year to $75 million. This had an effect of increasing the county's tax revenue. During his time on the board, Quinn was also instrumental in the creation of the \"Citizens Utility Board\", a consumer watchdog organization.\n\n\nQuinn did not seek re-election to the Cook County Board of Tax Appeals, in .

I tried to talk to the Governor, but the last time I spoke to him was in August of 2007. I think one of the problems is the Governor did sort of seal himself off from all the statewide officials ... Attorney General Madigan and myself and many others.\"  Blagojevich had announced in 2006 that Quinn was not to be considered part of his administration.\n\n\n\n\nOn January 29, 2009,  was removed from office by a vote of 59–0 by the Illinois State Senate.

His term as governor ended on January 12, 2015.\n\n\nAs governor, Quinn faced a state with a reputation for corruptionthe two previous governors both went to federal prisonand after two years polls showed Quinn himself was the \"Nation's most unpopular governor.\"  The main issue was a fiscal crisis in meeting the state's budget and its long-term debt as the national economic slump continued and Illinois did poorly in terms of creating jobs.  Quinn spoke often to the public and met regularly with state leaders, in stark contrast to 's seclusion from others. On August 20, 2013 Quinn signed a bill into law that raised the rural interstate speed limit in Illinois to 70&nbsp;mph. It was previously 65&nbsp;mph. The bill also raised the speed limit on the Illinois Toll Road. The law became effective at midnight January 1, 2014.\n\n\nQuinn announced several \"belt-tightening\" programs to help curb the state deficit. In July 2009, Quinn signed a $29 billion capital bill to provide construction and repair funds for Illinois roads, mass transit, schools, and other public works projects. The capital bill, known as \"Illinois Jobs Now!\", was the first since Governor 's Illinois FIRST plan, which was enacted in the late-1990s. On July 7, 2009, he for the second time in a week vetoed a budget bill, calling it \"out of balance\", his plan being to more significantly fix the budget gap in Illinois. In March 2009, Quinn called for a 1.5 percentage point increase in the personal income tax rate. To help offset the increased rate, he also sought to triple the amount shielded from taxation (or the \"personal exemption\") – from $2,000 per person to $6,000. However, the bill that eventually passed increased the personal income tax by 2%.\n\nWith the state budget deficit projected to hit $15 billion in 2011, the legislature in early 2011 raised the personal income tax from 3% to 5%, and the corporation profits tax 4.8% to 7%. Governor Quinn's office projected the new taxes will generate $6.8 billion a year, enough to balance the annual budget and begin reducing the state's backlog of about $8.5 billion in unpaid bills. A report from the Civic Federation in September 2011&nbsp;projected a $8.3&nbsp;billion deficit to end the budget year.\n\n\nAfter three years of tax increases for workers and businesses, ending with an increase in corporate taxes in 2011 from 5% to 7%, the national recession left the economy in trouble.  During an annual budget address on February 22, 2012 to the Illinois Legislature, Quinn warned that the state's financial system was nearing collapse.  The Associated Press reported that Quinn feared Illinois was \"on the verge of a financial meltdown because of pension systems eating up every new dollar and health care costs climbing through the roof.\"  According to the Civic Federation, Illinois is only able to remain solvent by not paying its bills on time.  Quinn advocated Medicaid and healthcare cuts totaling $1.6 billion in 2012; critics including Democratic State Representative  stated the cuts would remove hundreds of thousands of the poor and elderly from public health programs.  The unprecedented cuts were too small to resolve the long-term issue according to rating agencies that downgraded Illinois to the lowest credit rating of any US state in 2012.  As of November 2012,  totaled $85 billion with a backlog of $8 billion.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the state's financial obligations, in November 2012 Quinn cancelled contracts with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Union officials contended that \"Quinn wanted concessions so deep that they are an insult to every state employee,\"  while the administration contended that the state is paying salaries and benefits at levels that \"exceed the salaries and benefits of other unionized state workers across the country.\"  As of December 2012, Illinois had the fifth highest unemployment rate in the United States, and by March 2013, Illinois public-employee pension liability reached $100 billion.\n\nPat Quinn has been a major supporter of the controversial .\n\nIn 2009, Quinn signed into law the Video Gaming Act which legalized the use of video gambling machines in Illinois. Quinn had previously denounced video gambling as a \"bad bet\". Quinn said the legislation was necessary to make up revenue due to the recession. A 2019 ProPublica investigation found that Illinois gambling regulators were underfunded and understaffed, and the gambling failed to meet projected revenues for the state's public coffers.\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, Quinn appointed  to chair the Illinois Reform Commission, which was tasked with making recommendations for ethical reform for Illinois government.\n\nOn February 20, 2009, Quinn called for the resignation of US Senator , the man appointed to the  by Blagojevich to fill the vacant seat created by the resignation of . He changed his position, however, following pressure from prominent African Americans who threatened electoral repercussions.\n\nOn March 3, 2009, the '''' reported that Quinn had \"paid his own expenses\" many times as lieutenant governor, contradicting Blagojevich's accusations against Quinn.John O'Connor, \"AP review shows new Ill. governor often paid own travel expenses instead of charging taxpayers, AP and '''', March 3, 2009, found at  . Retrieved March 4, 2009.  As a rule, he either paid his own way, or stayed at \"cut rate hotels\" (such as ), and never charged  for his meals.\n\nIn June 2009, Quinn launched a panel, chaired by , to investigate  at the  amid fears that a prior investigation would be ineffective in instituting necessary reforms. The panel was charged with searching the admissions practices, amid reports that the  was a victim of  corruption. The panel found evidence of favoritism and its investigation culminated in the resignation of all but two University trustees.\n\nIn Spring 2014, federal prosecutors and the Illinois Legislative Audit Commission launched an investigation into Quinn's $55 million Neighborhood Recovery Initiative, a program launched weeks before 2010 election.\n\nOn October 22, a federal judge appointed an independent monitor to oversee hiring at the Illinois Department of Transportation. This followed a three-year investigation by the Illinois executive inspector general that uncovered politically motivated hiring at IDOT, which started under Gov. Blagojevich.\n\n\n\nQuinn won generally high praise for his leadership on environmental issues, going back at least as far as when he was lieutenant governor, where he helped develop annual statewide conferences on green building, created a state day to celebrate and defend rivers, and promoted measures such as rain gardens for water conservation. As governor, Quinn helped pass measures on solar and wind energy, including sourcing electricity for the state capitol from wind power, and helped secure funding for high-speed rail in the midwest corridor. As Governor and Lt. Governor, Quinn Co-Chaired the Illinois Green Government Council, a council that focused on greening state government and reducing waste.  The Illinois Green Government Council produced public annual sustainability reports tracking overall state government energy usage, fuel usage, water usage, and waste  In 2010 and 2014, the , Illinois's largest environmental group, endorsed Quinn, calling him \"The Green Governor.\" Quinn faced  from environmentalists after his support for a controversial law to regulate and launch fracking.\n\n\nOn March 9, 2011, Quinn signed the bill which abolished the death penalty in Illinois. On signing the bill, Quinn stated,\n\n\n\"It is impossible to create a perfect system, one that is free of all mistakes, free of all discrimination with respect to race or economic circumstance or geography. To have a consistent, perfect death penalty system, I have concluded, after looking at everything I've been given, that that's impossible in our state. I think it's the right and just thing to abolish the death penalty.\"\n\n\nIn an interview with '''', Quinn attributed his decision to the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin who had argued until the end of his life for a “consistent ethic of life\" that included opposing capital punishment. To date, capital punishment is still outlawed in Illinois. In 2011, Quinn received the Courageous Leadership Award from .\n\nOn May 17, 2012, Quinn appointed Brandon Bodor to be Executive Director of the . On September 11, 2012, the two announced that the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) had awarded $8.4 million to enable 1,200 volunteers in 29 AmeriCorps programs to better serve Illinois communities.\n\nQuinn is an advocate for gun control, supporting an ,  and s for Illinois. Quinn has also been known for criticizing  in Illinois (which would allow a person to have a concealed handgun on their person in public), and the . Despite this opposition, the Illinois General Assembly legalized concealed carry in the state on July 9, 2013, overriding Quinn's veto.  This made Illinois the last state in the U.S. to enact this type of legislation.\n\nIn Quinn's 2013 State of the State address, he declared his commitment to the legalization of . After a months-long battle in the legislature, Quinn signed the Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act into law on November 20, 2013, before a crowd of thousands, making Illinois the 16th state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage. He had previously signed a bill legalizing civil unions on January 31, 2011.\n\n\n, June 2018]]\nQuinn has kept a low profile since leaving office, volunteering for causes like veterans' affairs and consumer protection. Quinn has been critical of his successor, , calling him \"anti-worker\" and \"dishonest.\" He has stated that he is interested in grassroots petitions.\n\nOn June 12, 2016, Quinn announced a new petition drive called Take Charge Chicago to put a binding  on the Chicago ballot to place a two-term limit on the Mayor of Chicago and create a new elected position called the Consumer Advocate. As of mid-2017, that is still ongoing.\n\nOn October 27, 2017, Quinn announced he would run for  in the . Quinn was generally regarded as the most well-known candidate in the race, however he narrowly lost the nomination to State Senator  on March 20, 2018.\n\nFor the 2020 election cycle, Quinn championed a citizens initiated ballot item which would ask voters in  whether they believed that the city should adopt a system under which binding  to create city ordinances would be allowed. This ballot question was rejected by the city's election board, a decision subsequently upheld in the  and the Illinois Appeals Court.\n\nDuring the , Quinn flirted with the idea of running for Chicago mayor, going as far as collecting signatures to appear on the ballot. However, he declined to run in the election and subsequently endorsed U.S. Representative 's candidacy in the first round of voting, and then his former running mate  in the run-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* '''2006 Election for Governor/Lieutenant Governor of Illinois'''\n** '''/Pat Quinn''' (D) (inc.), 49.79%\n** / (R), 39.26%\n** Rich Whitney/Julie Samuels (Green), 10.36%\n* '''2002 Election for Governor / Lieutenant Governor'''\n** '''/Pat Quinn''' (D), 52%\n** / (R), 45%\n\n\n* '''1994 – Illinois Secretary of State'''\n** '''''' (R) (inc.)Illinois Blue Book 61.5%\n** Pat Quinn (D) 38.5%\n\n\n* '''1990 – Illinois Treasurer'''\n** '''Pat Quinn''' (D) 55.7%\n**  (R) 44.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n* Barone, Michael,  and Chuck McCutcheon, ''The Almanac of American Politics: 2012''  (2011) pp 512–14\n\n\n\n*  official Illinois government site\n*  campaign website\n* \n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He served as a  in the 9th ward for four terms, first in 1979 through 1983 and again from 1987 until 1998. Shaw also served as commissioner on the  from 1998 until 2004.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Shaw and his  brother  were dominant political \"kingmakers\" of Chicago's far South Side and southern suburbs. However, their influence dissipated greatly in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, with  largely beating them out to become the new kingmaker in what had been their territory. Both Shaw and his twin brother  were controversial figures.

He got his start at seventeen by working for an assistant precinct captain in the 24th ward. He later worked as a precinct captain for , prior to Lewis' 1963 murder.  He worked on Lewis' successful campaign for the . \n\nShaw and his twin brother became involved in the . In 1969, Shaw moved to the  of Chicago, settling in the  neighborhood. The Shaw brothers both moved to the far South Side of the city, believing it to be the best location to establish an African American-led  organization. In the late-1970s, he moved to the city's 9th Ward, on the South Side. From 1975 through 1978, Shaw was employed as an  and  executive at the .\n\n\nShaw served two tenures as the alderman from Chicago's ninth ward. In 1975, Shaw ran his first campaign for the Chicago City Council, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent 9th Ward Alexander Adduci.\n\n\nShaw was elected to the  in 1979, this time defeating Adducci. Shaw used racially charged rhetoric during the campaign. Adducci filed a lawsuit accusing supporters of Shaw's campaign of  a letter that made Adducci (who was ) appear . In 1979, the Illinois Board of Elections investigated allegations that Shaw had violated the state's Campaign Disclosure Act during his aldermanic campaign.\n\nShaw rose to prominence as a main  community ally of Mayor . He received criticism from Black independents when he voted in favor of Byrne's redistricting map for the city's wards, which a federal court would subsequently rule as being unfair to African Americans and . When Black protesters showed up at the City Council chamber to protest Byrne's firing of Black members of the  and the  Board, Shaw called for the removal of the protesters and stood in support of Byrne and Chicago Housing Authority chairman Charles Swibel. A January 1981  article by F. Richard Ciccone of the '''' described Shaw as \"no stranger to city council controversy, though only a freshman alderman\".\n\nIn 1981, Shaw introduced legislation that would have stripped the city's personnel code by drastically increasing the number of  hires, taking 15,000 civil service jobs away from having job security and merit-based testing as a hiring practice. He partnered with  on this legislation. He would tell the media, \"I asked my friends, Ed Vrdolyak and  to help me out, and they did\". Shaw also credited City Council floor leader  with assisting in redrafting the proposal on the City Council floor. The legislation was overwhelmingly approved in a city council vote. Shaw and Wilson Frost both argued that eliminating the personnel code, and its testing requirements, would be beneficial to Black job applicants. The legislation was ultimately ed by mayor Byrne, after facing strong opposition from Chicagoans (a ''Chicago Tribune'' poll found 76% of Chicagoans opposed removing the personnel code).\n\nIn its  for Shaw, the '''' credited him with supporting hundreds of ordinances in his two stints as an alderman that had the impact of providing more opportunities for black-owned businesses to do business with the city government.\n\nIn 1981, Shaw introduced legislation that would require  to have public . This was quickly shot down by the City Council. In 1982, Shaw voted against the  ordinance championed by mayor Byrne. The legislation passed without his support. In 1982, Shaw also introduced an ordinance that would have increased the salary of aldermen from $27,600 to $46,350. After this, Mayor Byrne publicly declared she would veto any pay raise for Chicago aldermen.\n\nShaw lost reelection to Perry H. Hutchison in 1983. Shaw's loss was attributed to his choice to endorse incumbent mayor Byrne over  in the Democratic primary for the . Washington won 80% of the vote in the 9th ward during the Democratic mayoral primary. Shaw was seen as having been disloyal to the black community for supporting Byrne over Washington (who was African American). Ahead of his city council , which coincided with the general election for the Chicago mayoral election, Shaw tried to align himself as a supporter of Washington's campaign. Hutchison, however, had supported Washington against Byrne in the mayoral primary. During the runoff campaign, Hutchison complained of a pamphlet that was being distributed in the ward in support of Shaw's campaign that implied that Hutchison had been involved in .\n\n\nIn 1984, Shaw and his brother took up the cause of calling for legislation to be passed to require black history to be taught in .\n\nIn December 1986, Shaw and his brother held a  in which they alleged that people were being denied care by s (HMOs) for life threatening conditions.\n\n\n\nIn 1987, Shaw defeated Hutchison to regain his old seat on the Chicago City Council. Hutchison had been indicted for taking bribes in a federal  ahead of the election. For this campaign, Shaw repositioned himself as a supporter of Harold Washington. Shaw was a strong advocate in support of pay raises for members of the City Council. Shaw clashed numerous times with civil rights and community leader , who called Shaw \"a hack\". Harold Washington derided Shaw as a \"two-bit hustler\". Shaw was regarded to be a somewhat amusing personality on the council, providing interesting quotes and antics for the media to report upon. In 1990,  of the ''Chicago Tribune'' noted that Shaw had a penchant for basking in the media attention he received, despite the media largely regarding him as clownish.\n\n]]\nIn September 1987, Shaw and fellow alderman Allan Streeter introduced a bill to remove the image of a sailing ship from the 150-year old city seal, alleging that it represented \"official government sanction of slavery\". Their legislation would replace the ship on the seal with a depiction of . City documents had once described the high-masted sailing ship on the seal as, \"emblematic of the approach of white man's civilization and commerce\". Shaw declared, \"The ship represents  in this country.\" He also believed that it bore a resemblance to s. Mayor Washington and a group of other black aldermen joined in support. Washington declared, speaking on the issue with the seal, \"It's old, it's degrading, and it has historical baggage.\" It would have cost more than $1 million to replace the use of the seal. Shaw personally estimated that it would cost between $1.5 million and $2 million. The push to change the seal received criticism from some City Council members, such as , who called it, \"ridiculous\", and  who called it, \"preposterous\". The debate was reported to largely fall upon racial lines, with black aldermen supporting the change and white aldermen standing against it. The seal, ultimately, remained unchanged. In September 1987, Shaw also introduced a proposed ordinance that would require the Chicago Transit Authority to open its bathrooms.\n\nAfter Harold Washington's , Shaw joined Edward M. Burke in stopping ' bid to be appointed his mayoral successor.  instead won the vote to be Washington's successor. Shaw also called for a more thorough investigation into Washington's cause of death. Shaw was a chief backer of Sawyer during his mayoralty.\n\nShaw had a tendency to make racially inflammatory statements. In 1988, Shaw was criticized for questioning witnesses at City Council hearings about their ethnic backgrounds, and was also accused of having made  remarks about \"Washington Jews\". In regards to the allegations of antisemitism, Shaw, who had received his early political training from Jewish political operatives in the 24th Ward, defended himself by writing, \"I have enjoyed a long and happy relationship with the Jewish community,\" and that, \"my many Jewish friends and I am personally hurt,\" by the accusations of antisemitism. In 1988, Shaw also opposed a measure that would aim to stop the use of racial, ethnic, and sexual insults at committee hearings. He argued that it would infringe on the right of the council to, \"protect the public interest.\" That same year, he also told the '''', \"A white should not be mayor. When they were mayor, they did not treat blacks and other minorities fairly. They do not know how to be fair.\"\n\nShaw utilized \"aldermanic prerogative\", a practice whereby alderman were given deference on  decisions in their wards. In 1988, on his own initiative he successfully championed downzoning for large areas in his ward.\n\n\nDuring the mayoralty of , Shaw was a somewhat independent member of the council, giving criticism to the mayor and casting votes in opposition to his budgets. He was considered an adversary of Daley. In 1990, John Kass of the ''Chicago Tribune'' called him the, \"only consistent critic of Richard Daley on the council floor.\" Daley and Shaw often argued with each other on the City Council Chamber floor. In one instance, Daley had Shaw's microphone turned-off, only for Shaw to continue yelling loudly at him. Shaw was reelected in 1991 and 1995. His 1991 reelection saw him defeat  bus driver Johnny J. O'Neal by a mere 37 votes. O'Neal would subsequently, in 1993, attempt to have the legitimacy of the vote count reinvestigated through litigation.\n\nIn 1989, Shaw opposed legislation championed by Daley to create a watchdog to oversee all of city government. The ordinance later passed, but with revisions that made aldermen exempt from the new inspector general's oversight.\n\nIn 1990, Shaw proposed an ordinance to ban an  awareness advertisement campaign that had seen posters placed on city transit that included same-sex couples kissing, claiming that the posters were, \"promoting a lifestyle, which I object to.\" In January 1993 Shaw, joined by , offered half-serious criticisms of former  coach  after Edward M. Burke proposed naming the 7th anniversary of the Bears'  victory \"Mike Ditka Day\" in Chicago. In 1993, Shaw opposed Daley's nomination of Thomas Scorza to be appointed . Shaw opposed him due to testimony about improprieties in Scorza's office during his tenure as assistant U.S. Attorney. Shaw raised further allegations against Scorza, without providing any evidence publicly.\n\nIn 1996, as part of , the U.S. attorney's office  financial records from Shaw's campaign and ward funds, as well as telephone records. Before this, federal agents had unsuccessfully sought to interview Shaw.\n\nAfter resigning to serve on the Cook County Board of Review, he backed the candidacy of his son Herbert Shaw in the 1999 election to succeed him. However, , a political unknown backed by  and , defeated him in an .\n\n\nIn , Shaw was elected in the inaugural election of the newly formed  (which was a restructuring of the former Cook County Board of Appeals), Shaw was elected in to as the commissioner from its . He was reelected in .\n\nWhile on the board, Shaw was considered to be an ally of fellow board member , voting in lockstep with him on most cases. On occasion, however, he did dissent in a number of cases where Berrios and the board's third member, , both voted to lower the tax rates on large properties in downtown Chicago.\n\nDuring his tenure, he was dubbed the \"reduction commissioner\". He was also criticized as handing out political and patronage favors. The 's office investigated accusations that Shaw had helped to arrange a property tax break for his brother (saving him as much as $1,219), but found no wrongdoing. Additionally, the Board of Review made changes to its policies on reviewing tax cases in response to the fact that several of Shaw's staff members had owned properties which they analyzed themselves in their positions. Cases where Shaw's staff had done this had been flagged by fellow board member Maureen Murphy.\n\nIn , Shaw was narrowly unseated in the Democratic primary by  Rogers had been recruited to run against Shaw by Jesse Jackson Jr. and James Meeks. Jackson had been a regular political rival of Shaw brothers.\n\n\nIn 2006, Shaw's brother William, then the mayor of , appointed him to be city's first inspector general, a newly created position that paid $70,000 annually. The position also gave Shaw use of a city-owned car. He was confirmed to the position by the city's trustees.  This move angered some in the village, who saw it as blatant . The  criticized this as a, \"$70,000 joke on the taxpayers of Dolton\". The position tasked Shaw with rooting out corruption in the village. However, village ordinance made it so that both the mayor (William Shaw) and village trustees were off-limits for investigation.\n\nAt the time he was appointed to this corruption watchdog position, federal investigators had actually been keeping an eye on Shaw himself for potential involvement in corruption in Dolton. In 2005, federal investigators discovered a practice that existed in Dolton and a number of other Chicago suburbs where politically connected citizens were allowed to carry guns and mimics of police badges. Those benefiting from this practice in Dolton had been individuals that had given notable sums of money to the campaigns of Shaw and his brother. It was discovered that at least two of those benefiting from this were  that had used the mimicry police IDs in order to avoid having police search their vehicles.\n\nIn 2006, Shaw was criticized for flashing a  while personally conducting a  of an alleged .\n\nShaw would remain in this position through the launch of his  campaign in late 2009.\n\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Shaw and his brother William were dominant political \"kingmakers\" of Chicago's far South Side and southern suburbs. They garnered the support of the African American electorate in the area. Over the years, their main rivals for influence there was the Jackson family, Jesse Jackson and Jesse Jackson Jr. Their influence dissipated greatly in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, with Jesse Jackson Jr. largely beating them out to become the new kingmaker at the time. Their tide first began to change when Jesse Jackson Jr. won election to U.S. congress in 1996, defeating the Shaw brothers-backed candidate  in the Democratic primary. In 1999, Jackson Jr. successfully backed Anthony Beale against Shaw's son Herbert Shaw in the race to succeed Shaw as 9th Ward alderman. In 2000, Jackson Jr. backed  in his successful state representative Democratic primary race against Shaw-backed candidate Willis Harris. In 2002, Jackson Jr. encouraged James Meeks to make his  successful general election challenge to William Shaw for state senate. Jackson accused the Shaw brothers, that same year, of being behind the  campaign of a retired truck driver named Jesse L. Jackson against him for congress. In 2004, Jackson backed Larry Rogers Jr.'s successful primary challenge against Shaw for Cook County Board of Review. Also in 2004, the Shaw brothers denied involvement with two challengers running against Jackson for congress, who each filed challenges to the younger Jackson's petition signatures (which, if successful, would have seen Jackson removed from the ballot in the Democratic primary). The two challengers to Jackson worked for Dolton (where William Shaw was mayor), and used the village's attorney as their lawyer. By 2006, the Shaw brothers leveraged a Dolton  program to regularly assail Jesse Jackson Jr.\n\nWhen the Shaw brothers ran the 9th Ward Regular Democratic Organization, they and their campaign volunteers helped deliver strong voter support for campaigns of African American politicians such as Mayor Harold Washington and Illinois State Senator , and the  of . They also helped mobilize support in the area for the  of .\n\nIn 1996, Shaw was elected the 9th Ward Democratic , succeeding his brother William in holding this elected Democratic Party leadership position. In 2000, Shaw was unseated by Anthony Beale.\n\nAmong the individuals that got their starts in the political organization run by the Shaw brothers was .\n\nAfter Shaw's death, the ''Chicago Crusader'' credited him and his brother's political organization with successfully pushing the Illinois State Legislature to establish new  and  sub-circuits located in African American city wards, which the ''Chicago Crusader'' wrote had the impact of enabling more than 60 African American individuals to become judges.\n\n\n\nIn 1984, Shaw was one of four individuals who challenged incumbent   in the Democratic primary for . Other challengers included state senators  and . Savage won renomination, with Shaw placing fourth.\n\n\nIn October 2004, Shaw announced that he would be challenging incumbent village president (mayor) Don DeGraff in the April 2005 , election. Shaw had moved from the  neighborhood of Chicago to the southern suburb in 1999, shortly after he left the Chicago City Council. Shaw was defeated in an immense , with DeGraff receiving 91% of the vote, to Shaw's 6%.\n\nDuring his campaign, Shaw pledged to bring more business and job opportunities to the village, if elected. The village had a 10%  rate at the time.\n\nDuring the campaign, Shaw accused incumbent mayor DeGraff, who was white, of preventing more minorities from working for the village by utilizing the village's residency policy, which allowed village employees, with the exception of department heads and their deputies, to reside outside of the village. Shaw proposed making residency in the village a requirement for all village employees.\n\nShaw tried to characterize DeGraff as an \"ultraconservative\". Shaw claimed that DeGraff was a supporter of heavily  politician , who had been the  nominee who ran against Democrat Barack Obama in the . DeGraff refuted this by pointing out that he had supported Obama's campaign for the . Shaw charged that DeGraff practiced nepotism as mayor. DeGraff denied that the allegations were true. Businesses that Shaw alleged DeGraff was personally profiting from awarding contracts to either did not have any connection to DeGraff, or had not even received municipal contracts in South Holland.\n\nA victory by Shaw would have helped to reestablish the Shaw brothers' declining political influence in the southern part of the Chicago area. Ahead of the election, commenting on Shaw's campaign in South Holland and his brother's coinciding reelection campaign in neighboring Dolton, Jennifer Shalka of the ''Chicago Tribune'' wrote, \"a double win would give the Shaws their own . Dolton and South Holland have a total of about 50,000 residents.\" Political rival Jesse Jackson Jr. supported DeGraff in Shaw's race, and also supported an unsuccessful challenger to Shaw's brother William in the Dolton election.\n\n\nIn 2006, Shaw ran for the Democratic nomination for the 29th district seat in the , seeking to unseat incumbent . He was unsuccessful, losing to Miller by 70.88% to 29.12%.\n\nThe campaign was seen as another effort by Shaw to stop the decline of his and his brother's political power in Chicago's suburbs. Political observers saw Shaw as unlikely to succeed, however. This was another saga in the Shaw brothers' political rivalry with Jesse Jackson Jr., as Miller was considered Jackson's \"point man\" in the Illinois House of Representatives on matters such as education reform and the . Jackson gave his backing to Miller in the election.\n\n\nShaw ran for Cook County assessor in . If elected, he would have been the first  holder of the office. In January 2010, the '''' reported that Shaw's campaign lacked not only a website, but also lacked a campaign office and phone number. During the campaign, Shaw trained his criticisms at opponent Joseph Berrios, and largely ignored his other opponent, Raymond A. Figueroa. Since soon after incumbent assessor  announced that he would not seek reelection, Berrios had been considered the  in the race to succeed him.\n\nShaw placed second out of three candidates in the Democratic primary, with 34.09% of the vote, with the winner of the primary, Berrios, receiving 39.14% of the vote. Shaw had placed first in 19 of the 20 wards in Chicago with the most sizeable black populations.\n\n\nIn December 2013, Shaw moved from South Holland, Illinois, where he had lived since 1999, to the Hyde Park– area of Chicago. In March 2014, Shaw announced he would run in the . He was the first noteworthy politician to announce that they would be challenging incumbent mayor , and second challenger to announce, after . However, he ultimately withdrew his candidacy.\n\nIn the previous  mayoral election, Shaw had been an advisor to the campaign of Carol Moseley Braun.\n\nDuring his candidacy, he took positions, including supporting a move to having the  be an elected . He criticized Emanuel for public school closures. He also voiced concern of the city's ability to fund  programs for municipal employees, criticizing cutting benefits for retired workers. He pledged to rectify both previously-implemented school closings and decreases of benefits for retired municipal employees.\n\nHe described his campaign strategy as aiming to bring together a coalition of African Americans, Latinos, and others displeased with the policies of the incumbent mayor. He stated he believed that he had strength as a contender, saying that he believed he had strong . During his candidacy, an early July 2014 poll taken by  showed that, in a head-to-head matchup, incumbent mayor Rahm Emanuel led him 47.7% to 29.6%, with 22.8% of voters being undecided. Shaw's campaign had very low funds.\n\nAfter dropping out, Shaw endorsed  in the election. Shaw would go on to again support Wilson in his  mayoral campaign as well, taking part in his March 2018 campaign announcement.\n\n\nShaw was a candidate in  in the Democratic primary for the  board. He withdrew his candidacy before the election, however. He declared again to run in , but was ultimately disqualified from appearing on the ballot.\n\n\nIn 2021, Shaw ran unsuccessfully for the mayoral office once held by his brother in Dolton, Illinois. He placed last out of four candidates in the Democratic Party primary, receiving six percent of the vote. His opponents were incumbent mayor Riley Rogers and village trustees  and .  Shaw endorsed the primary's victor, Henyard, in the general election. Henyard won the general election.\n\n\nShaw fathered two sons and four daughters. In 1997, Shaw's 27-year-old son John was murdered by gunshots near his South Side Chicago house. From 1999 until 2013, Shaw lived in South Holland, Illinois. In December 2013, he moved to the – area of Chicago.\n\nAt the peak of their political careers, Shaw and his brother were recognizable-looking for both wearing similar s.\n\nIn December 2008, in Dolton, Shaw, then still the village's inspector general, alleged that he had been assaulted in an altercation with corrections officer Elliott R. Kozel, who was circulating a petition in support of mayoral candidate Riley Rogers (the nephew of Larry Rogers, who had unseated Shaw on the Cook County Board of Review). The assault charges against Rogers were dismissed by a Cook County judge on February 18, 2009. In February 2012, Shaw was hospitalized after he fell and injured himself in his house. His injuries included a fractured nose.\n\nShaw contracted  in 2021 during the , managing to overcome the viral infection.\n\n\nShaw died at the age of 83 of cancer on July 22, 2021 at a rehabilitation facility in South Holland, Illinois.

In 2022, he sought the Republican nomination for  A  veteran, Irvin has worked as an educator and prosecutor.\n\n\nIrvin was born and raised in , the son of a single mother. He is a graduate of . After high school, he enlisted in the  and served in the Gulf War. Irvin graduated with a B.A. from  and in 1998, he received a  from the . He served as a substitute teacher in the East Aurora School District and as an adjunct professor at Robert Morris College and Northern Illinois University.\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Irvin served as an assistant state's attorney for the  State's Attorney's office and the Kane County State's Attorney's office.\n\nIn 2001, he was named Aurora's first community prosecutor, an alternative law enforcement strategy designed to improve police relationships with residents and develop solutions to drugs, prostitution, and other quality of life crimes. As community prosecutor, he joined the 's “Weed and Seed” program, which aimed to both aggressively combat crime in specified areas, but also provide redevelopment and social services. Irvin also successfully pressured the owners of Woodlands Apartments, an apartment complex notorious for violent crimes, drug sales, and prostitution, to improve security of the complex or be shut down. A year after Irvin's intervention, residents said the complex was \"pretty much cleaned up.\"\n\nIrvin was removed as community prosecutor in late 2002, and he resigned from the Kane County State's Attorney's office in 2003 to open his own law office.\n\n\nIn 2003, Irvin announced he would run for Mayor of Aurora after incumbent mayor David Stover announced that he would not seek a third term. While the race was officially non-partisan, Irvin was supported by prominent Republican politicians and conservative organizations, and his opponent  had the support of Democratic politicians, including then-Senator . Weisner also had the support of eight of Aurora's twelve aldermen and raised nearly three times the amount of money as Irvin. In April 2005, Weisner defeated Irvin with 60.8% percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2007, Irvin won election as Alderman At-Large on the Aurora City Council, the first African American elected to the position.\n\nIn 2008, he announced he would run for mayor again and challenge Weisner. Irvin criticized Weisner for enacting tax increases during his first term, including a 7.5 percent property tax increase, and pledged to roll back property taxes if elected mayor. In April 2009, Weisner defeated Irvin and fellow alderman , and won re-election.\n\n\nIn 2016, Weisner stepped down, citing his health. Irvin, state representative , alderman Michael Saville, and Weisner's assistant chief of staff Richard \"Rick\" Guzman ran to replace him. Following the February 28, 2017 primary, Irvin and Guzman advanced to the April 4 general election. Irvin campaigned on controlling crime and improving education, and narrowly defeated Guzman with 53% of the vote.\n\nHe was sworn in on May 9, 2017, becoming Aurora's first African-American mayor.\n\nOn April 6, 2021, Irvin won re-election to another four-year term, defeating Alderman Judd Lofchie and union carpenter John Laesch with over 55% of the vote. Irvin made economic development central to his campaign.\n\n\nWhen five people were killed in a  in Aurora in 2019, Irvin reacted by saying, \"It's a shame that mass shootings such as this have become commonplace in our country [and] that a cold and heartless offender would be so selfish as to think he has the right to take an innocent life. But we as a society cannot allow these horrific acts to become commonplace.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting deaths of 15-year-old Jasmine Noble and 20-year-old Juanya Booker in Aurora in 2019, Irvin said his administration would put a renewed focus on youth mentoring programs. This included city promotion of such programs.\n\nIn December 2019, Irvin defended the Aurora Police's issues of notices to nineteen convicted  at Aurora  Wayside Cross Ministries that they needed to leave the house, saying that the house's proximity to a  at McCarty Park meant state law prohibited it from housing such offenders. The offenders' lawyer raised concerns that the offenders could be forced into  in the middle of . Following a legal dispute, all the offenders found alternative housing.\n\n\nOn March 16, 2020, Irvin declared a formal emergency due to the , which gave him emergency powers. He supported Illinois Governor 's March 2020  and urged residents to take preventative steps such as .\n\n\nIrvin condemned looting that took place in downtown Aurora in late May 2020, amid  across the world over the . \"Aurora will be ready for you if you try to cause destruction in our community,\" he said. \"We will not put up with this BS and foolishness.\" Additionally, he placed two back-to-back curfews in the city during the rioting.\n\nIn the wake of Floyd's murder, Irvin backed a number of police reforms in Aurora, including officer body cameras and a civilian review board to investigate complaints about officers.\n\n\nAfter the organizers of Aurora's 2022 pride parade asked that uniformed and armed police officers not march in the parade, Irvin said he would not attend it – as he had in 2018 and 2019 – and pulled the City's float from the parade. The organizers' request was made to make the parade \"the most welcoming environment possible,\" and they said that “trust between police and LGBTQ people and people of color” is extremely low.\n\nDays before the parade was set to occur, the City of Aurora revoked its permit, saying that not enough police officers had signed up for the extra shifts needed for adequate security at the event. The  had previously warned Irvin against revoking the permit. When a judge upheld the permit's revocation, organizers threatened to file a federal lawsuit. However, Aurora officials said that by offering a triple pay incentive, they had secured enough officers to work at the parade.\n\n\nOn December 16, 2021, it was reported that Illinois billionaire hedge fund manager  was to fund a  of Irvin. Griffin wanted to oust incumbent J.B Pritzker, a Democrat. The news was surprising given Irvin's previous praise of Pritzker and because he had not been widely seen as a potential candidate. Several other candidates were already seeking the Republican nomination. Previously, in October 2021, a spokesperson for Irvin said that there was \"no way\" he would run for governor.\n\nOn January 17, 2022, Irvin officially announced his gubernatorial campaign and said his running mate for  was Illinois State Representative . To launch is campaign, he released a highly-produced video touting his background as a descendant of enslaved people, an Army veteran and the mayor of Illinois' second-largest city.\n\nPritzker's campaign connected Irvin to former Illinois Governor , who was widely seen as unpopular. Fellow Republican candidates questioned Irvin's principals and party loyalty, as he pulled Democratic ballots in 2014, 2016, and 2020.\n\nIrvin struggled to answer for his previous support of Pritzker as well as his position on abortion.\n\nWhile seen as a conservative at the beginning of his political career, as Aurora mayor he adopted policies much more in line with , before again reversing himself on a number of issues when he ran for governor.\n\nIn May 2022, it was reported that at Aurora cannabis dispensary Zen Leaf on May 24, 2021, Irvin's then-girlfriend Laura Ayala-Clarke was charged after she allegedly assaulted a security guard after they touched her in an effort to remove her from the dispensary. When Irvin arrived on the scene, according to a police report, he was overheard saying in a phone call that the \"charges would be taken care of.\" Irvin later said that he said they would be taken care of in the sense that she would be afforded a lawyer and that he did not abuse his mayoral power.\n\nWhile Irvin quickly garnered the support of the party's establishment and several donations from wealthy Republicans including Griffin, he ultimately failed to win over the party's right-wing base and lost the primary in a landslide, coming in third place out of six tickets, with only 15% of the vote. State Senator  and running mate Stephanie Trussell won the primary with 57% of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n}}\n\n \n\n\n\n}}|party=Republican Party (United States)|votes=454,068|percentage=57.7}}\n|party=Republican Party (United States)|votes=123,156|percentage=15.6}}|party=Republican Party (United States)|votes=117,276|percentage=14.9}}\n\n|party=Republican Party (United States)|votes=51,611|percentage=6.6}}\n|party=Republican Party (United States)|votes=33,897|percentage=4.3}}\n|party=Republican Party (United States)|votes=7,199|percentage=0.9}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A member of the , he was first elected to the Chicago City Council in 1969, and represented part of the city's Southwest Side. Chair of Council's Committee on Finance, Burke had been called Chicago's \"most powerful alderman\" by the ''''. Burke was named one of the \"100 Most Powerful Chicagoans\" by '''', describing him as \"[o]ne of the last of the old-school Chicago Machine pols.\"\n\nBurke is the longest-serving alderman in Chicago history. Despite gaining prominence in Chicago politics, Burke was known to clash with the \"old guard\" of Mayor  and often aligned with fellow Councilman . Along with Vrdolyak, he was a leader of the \"\" during the first term of Mayor , the \"\" era. Burke and his staff were the subjects of federal and local investigations, and members of his staff were the targets of indictments and convictions involving payroll and contracting irregularities. Burke opted not to run in the , ending a record 14-term tenure on the City Council.\n\nBurke was the lead partner with Klafter & Burke, a law firm that specializes in property tax appeals; the firm has served clients who do business with the city and also provided services to former U.S. president . As of August 2019, Burke is no longer a partner with the law firm.\n\nOn November 29, 2018, Burke's office at  and his Aldermanic ward office were seized by federal agents, who ejected staff and papered over the doors and windows. On January 3, 2019, Burke was charged with attempted extortion for allegedly using his political office to drive business for his law firm.   On December 21, 2023, Burke was found guilty by a federal jury on 13 of 14 counts of racketeering, bribery, and extortion.  On June 24, 2024, Burke was sentenced to two years in prison and a $2 million fine. \n\nBurke's wife is former  Justice . He and his wife were  and were party to a protracted, highly publicized, racially charged  dispute.\n\n\nBurke is a lifelong resident of . His father, Joseph P. Burke, was a Cook County Sheriff's policeman who worked as a court . Joseph Burke served as  from the 14th Ward (a local  post), and was elected alderman from the 14th Ward in November 1953.\n\nEd Burke attended Visitation Grammar School in Visitation Parish on Chicago's South Side and is a 1961 graduate of . He graduated with a bachelor's degree from  in 1965, then worked for three years as a Chicago police officer, assigned to the state's attorney's office. Meanwhile, he studied law at . In 1968, Burke received a  degree, was admitted to the Illinois Bar, and married his wife, Anne Marie.\n\nWhile in law school in the late 1960s, an era of escalation in the , Burke received a  deferment as a full-time student. After his marriage and the death of his father, he applied for and was granted a hardship deferment (), as the sole support of his wife, mother, and two younger brothers. In June 1969, the Illinois  board of appeals reclassified him  (\"available for unrestricted military service\"). At the same time, he was accepted into a Chicago-based  unit, the 363rd civil affairs group, as a . Political rivals expressed concern that special consideration allowed Burke to join the Reserve unit ahead of others, but an Army investigation found no evidence of manipulation in his favor.\n\n\n\nBurke succeeded his father in local politics, first as Democratic Committeeman and then as alderman from the 14th Ward. After the elder Burke died in office of cancer on May 11, 1968, Edward Burke took leave from his job as a policeman to replace his father as Democratic committeeman for the 14th Ward. Though not a , Burke won election to his father's committeeman seat in a secret vote of 65 precinct captains, defeating a veteran precinct captain by just 3½ votes. At 24, Burke was the youngest person in Chicago's history to become a ward committeeman, a position he held until being defeated by State Representative  on March 17, 2020.\n\n\nThe 14th Ward Democrats slated the young Burke as the Democratic candidate in a special election called for on March 11, 1969, to fill vacancies in city council, including the 14th Ward. Burke faced six opponents, but won with a majority of 11,204 votes, while the next highest candidate received 1460 votes. He was sworn in by Mayor  on March 14. Following the 1971 aldermanic elections, the Council approved the appointment of Burke, who was at the time a police sergeant on leave, as chairman of the Police and Fire Committee. In 1972 and 1973, Burke joined Alderman  in a dissident caucus of aldermen demanding a greater voice in city affairs from Mayor Daley and finance committee chairman . The dissident aldermen were labelled the \"Young Turks,\" and their caucus was called the \"coffee rebellion\" after the beverage served at their morning meetings. In the backroom of the city council chamber, Burke once threatened to punch Alderman  in the nose if Despres were not so old.\n\nFormer city commissioner of consumer affairs  announced her challenge to Chicago Mayor  on April 24, 1978, describing herself as an alternative to a \"cabal of evil men [that] has fastened onto the government of the City of Chicago,\" and, when pressed to name them, singled out Burke and Vrdolyak. However, during her mayoralty, Byrne would ultimately work together with Burke and Vrdolyak.\n\nHaving been first elected in a 1969 special election, Burke has since been reelected thirteen times, in 1971, 1975, 1979, 1983, 1987, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, , and . After Burke's first campaign for alderman, he has been unopposed in most of his re-election campaigns. In 2007, Burke faced his first opponent since 1971, a school teacher who had never run for office. A Burke supporter unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the opponent's ballot application, but the case was tied up in court for most of the campaign, and Burke went on to win with nearly 90 percent of the vote.\n\nBurke did not seek reelection in  and retired after completing his thirteenth full term.\n\n\n\nBurke was, along with Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, a leader of the \"\", a city council majority voting block, which included 28  and one Puerto Rican aldermen, who opposed the agenda of the newly elected Mayor Harold Washington, Chicago's first  mayor, during Washington's first three years as mayor, 1983–1986, a period referred to as . Vrdolyak, a Burke mentor, was chairman of the . Vrdolyak forged the alliance by expanding the number of city council committees to 29 and negotiating 29 committee chairmanship assignments. On May 2, 1983, during the first city council meeting of the Washington administration, the mayor and some aldermen left the meeting, Vrdolyak was  of the city council (chair of city council meetings when the mayor is not present) so he continued the meeting. Burke was chosen to chair the powerful Finance Committee.\n\nBurke assumed a vocal role in anti-Washington attacks and was considered second to Vrdolyak in the anti-Washington caucus. Burke sued in  to remove Washington from office, contending that Washington forfeited his office by being three weeks late in filing a routine financial disclosure by the deadline set by state law. The suit was dismissed. Burke asked Illinois Attorney General  to seek the ouster of Washington. The request was denied. Richard M. Daley, Cook County States Attorney at the time, pleaded for unity, saying, \"This personal hatred has gone too far.\"\n\n\n\nIn the spring of 1987, in Chicago's municipal elections, Vrdolyak, rather than seeking re-election as alderman, was the Solidarity Party's candidate challenging Washington for mayor. Washington won re-election, and Washington allies won twenty-five city council seats. Burke led opposition in the city council, but Washington supporter Alderman  replaced Burke as Chairman of the Committee on Finance. Ousted from the spacious Finance Committee staff offices, Burke never used the relatively modest office allocated to him in City Hall and instead worked out of his private law office two blocks away. In the days following the death of Mayor Washington in office, Burke supported the Council's selection of Alderman  over Evans to serve as mayor. Sawyer prevailed, but Burke was the alderman who least often voted in support of the legislative agenda of Mayor Sawyer, Chicago's second black mayor. After Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in the spring of 1989, Daley nominated Burke as Finance chairman, a position he had held until January 4, 2019, a day after he was charged with attempted exortion of a Burger King operator to gain more property tax appeal business for his private law firm, Klafter & Burke.\n\nThe chairmanship of the city council's Committee on Finance has been described as \"the No. 2 spot in city government\". Almost all expenditures, tax matters, and many city contracts must be recommended by the Finance Committee before they can be considered by the full Council. As Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Burke controlled a 63-member staff and $2.2-million annual budget, dwarfing the resources of other council committees. In the city's self-managed  program, the Finance Committee determines and approves payment amounts in disability claims. As Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Burke controls a $1.3M per year taxpayer-funded payroll account available to aldermen with no scrutiny. In 2008, Burke spent the largest portion of the account, $70,164, more than any other alderman by more than $26,000. Burke is also a member of the city council's committees on Aviation; Budget and Government Operation; Energy, Environmental Protection and Public Utilities; and Zoning. Additionally, Burke is a member of the Chicago Planning Commission and Economic Development Commission. He controls three well-funded s, the \"Friends of Edward M Burke,\" the \"14th Ward Regular Democratic Organization,\" and \"The Burnham Committee.\" In July 2009, Burke's campaign funds totaled $3.7&nbsp;million, higher than any other alderman and one of the largest in Illinois. Illinois judges are elected in partisan elections, and a significant aspect of Burke's influence derives from his role as the longtime chairman of the judicial slating subcommittee of the Cook County Democratic Party.\n\nBurke has been a principal draftsman of the map of ward boundaries. When Burke started his political career, the 14th Ward that he represents was centered in the  neighborhood, more than a mile and a half east of where it is now. The 14th Ward is a ed area whose shape has been described as \"like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle\". With each new ward map, drawn every 10 years, its boundaries have been moved farther west. As of 2010, its boundaries extended from 39th Street south to 59th and from Western Avenue west to Cicero Avenue, including most of the ,  and  neighborhoods. The ethnic composition of the ward has changed dramatically during Burke's tenure in office. As of 1968, residents were predominantly of  or other  extraction, but by 2010 it had a large  and  population.\n\nBurke maintained a taxpayer-salaried staff to ghost-write speeches, resolutions, and works of non-fiction for him, including Thomas J. O'Gorman, carried on Burke's city council staff payroll as a \"legislative aide\" since 1995. In October 2006, Burke and O'Gorman published ''End of Watch'', a book detailing the lives and tragedies of police officers who died in the line of duty. Also, Burke and R. Craig Sautter published the book ''Inside the : Chicago Presidential Conventions 1860–1996''. Under Burke's direction, the Finance Committee staff compiles historical exhibits in City Hall and drafts honorary resolutions for special visitors to Chicago or recently deceased prominent Americans and Chicagoans. Burke was named \"Best Orator at City Hall\" in the '''''s \"Best of Chicago 2010\" special issue.\n\n\n\nThe staffing practices of Burke's Finance Committee came under scrutiny in local and federal investigations of ghost-payrolling abuses in local government and resulted in several indictments and convictions.\n\nMarie D'Amico, the daughter of Alderman  of the 39th Ward of Chicago, pleaded guilty to having collected tens of thousands of dollars in no-work jobs between 1981 and 1994 from three separate public agencies: Cook County sheriff, Cook County clerk, and the city council's Finance Committee  while Burke was chairman. Burke denied knowing D'Amico rarely showed up for work. Burke said the Finance Committee's chief investigator, who had died in 1994, \"apparently connived\" with D'Amico to carry D'Amico on the payroll, prompting the '''' editorial, \"Dead Men Can't Wear Stripes.\" D'Amico was the first indictment in what became a federal investigation of ghost payrolling known as . In January 1995, the Operation Haunted Hall grand jury subpoenaed the personnel records of three City Council Committees: Finance, Budget and Traffic.\n\nBurke's long-time aldermanic secretary worked full-time out of the downtown office of Burke's law firm, even though her salary was paid by the city. The secretary was subpoenaed by the Operation Haunted Hall grand jury. Alderman  asked, \"Why is she over at the law firm? It looks bad. It raises the appearance that she's possibly doing not only city work but law firm work.\" An attorney for the Finance Committee said, \"I don't have to explain why she's at the law firm. [Burke] doesn't have to explain. It makes no difference where she sits...She's a city employee and she does city work.\" The secretary was transferred to City Hall.\n\nBurke's law firm had employed Joseph A. Martinez, a real estate tax appeal attorney, as a full-time partner since about 1977, when in 1981 Mayor Jane Byrne appointed Martinez to replace the resigning 31st Ward Alderman Chester Kuta. Martinez served out the remainder of Kuta's term but declined to run for re-election when the ward committeeman endorsed a challenger. Between 1985 and 1992, Martinez received $91,000 in wages and benefits for doing little or no work for city council committees, and was a target of Operation Haunted Hall. In April 1995, after the federal subpoena of Council committee personnel records, Martinez returned the $91,000, sending cash to City Hall in three installments. He was charged and pleaded guilty on January 23, 1997. In his plea agreement, he admitted he was a ghost payroller on city council committees, starting with the Finance Committee in 1987, and said that he was employed in each committee job \"in order to receive health insurance\". Martinez's attorney said Burke got Martinez the jobs because Burke's law firm did not provide health insurance. In a statement, Burke wrote, \"A memorandum filed in Mr. Martinez's case [has] asserted that I participated in a scheme that gave rise to these charges. This allegation is untrue. I have done nothing wrong in connection with this matter.\" -winning columnist  wrote, \"You would think that a bright fellow such as Burke – whose father was a ward boss and an alderman – would know better...\"\n\nBurke was  of security firm SDI Security, Inc. from shortly after it was formed in 1989 until 1994. Burke hired the President of SDI, Michael A. Pedicone, as an outside lawyer for the Finance Committee.  SDI was owned by 11th ward Alderman , chairman of the Council's Transportation Committee, and Mayor Richard M. Daley's , and Huels' wife and brother. A federal grand jury subpoenaed Burke's and Huels' campaign finance records and ethics disclosures, and Pedicone's billings. The Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Illinois Supreme Court, the state agency that regulates the conduct of attorneys in Illinois, investigated Burke and subpoenaed all records on SDI from the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation. In late December 1997, a grand jury convened by the  's office subpoenaed records on expenditures to SDI from Burke's Finance and Huels' Transportation Committees, notable in that local prosecutors rarely investigate local politicians. In a memo to aldermen, Burke wrote, \"He [Pedicone] was not a ghost payroller,\" and that Pedicone had been paid about $490,000 over eight years for handling more than 450 disability-claim cases. Huels' resignation was the first major public corruption scandal of Daley's first two terms, and editorials called for Burke's resignation as well.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing for a Chicago attorney, a federal agent testified that the attorney said that his job with Burke's Finance Committee only required four hours of work a week, although he was paid a full-time salary. On January 8, 1998, federal prosecutors in Operation Haunted Hall indicted another Chicago attorney for collecting $9,223 in wages and benefits from the Finance Committee in 1991 and 1992 despite doing little or no work.\n\nBurke hired criminal defense attorney , a former United States attorney and a partner in the law firm , to represent him. Burke was not charged with any wrongdoing in the probe. By 1999, Operation Haunted Hall resulted in 34 guilty pleas, one conviction after trial, and one acquittal.\n\nOn December 4, 2008, Illinois State Representative  resigned after serving about 15 years in the state legislature, and was eligible to receive a public pension of about $64,000 per year based on the standard of 85% of his roughly $75,000 annual salary. Burke hired the newly retired Molaro for $12,000 for one month to write a 19-page  about Chicago's perennially under-funded pensions. When Molaro officially retired on January 1, 2009, his pensionable salary was annualized as $144,000, nearly doubling his pension. On August 16, 2012, Illinois Governor  signed a bill which limited the state's liability when former state legislators bolster their state pensions with short-term jobs with cities, counties and other local governments.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, although one of eight alderman who were attorneys, only Burke disclosed law clients who were local government contractors. Burke had 37 law clients that did business with the city or other local government agencies, according to his annual ethics statement filed with the city. Burke disclosed 2008 income above the reporting threshold of $5,000 from each of 31 law clients that do business with the city.\n\nBurke has been criticized for alleged conflicts of interest involving law clients and his role as chairman of the Council's Finance Committee. Burke has helped line up millions of dollars in public subsidies to companies that later hired his firm for property tax assessment appeals. Burke law clients which regularly have legislative issues before the Finance Committee have included communications company , the , , and several major airlines and concessionaires at the city-owned  and  airports.\n\nFor example, Cotter and Company, a wholesaler to 6,000  hardware stores, sought a package of public subsidies to keep their headquarters and operations in Chicago. In February 1996, while the final components of the package were working their way through City Hall, Burke toured Cotter's headquarters, at the end of which he handed out his business card from his private law practice and asked for the company's property tax appeals business. Cotter decided to hire Burke in March 1996 and finalized the arrangement in June 1996. An unprecedented $2.8&nbsp;million cash grant from the City to Cotter, never publicized by the Daley administration, was included in a $20&nbsp;million bond issue approved by the Finance Committee and the city council by July 31, 1996.\n\n\n\nBurke recuses himself from voting on issues involving clients so often that he was called \"Chicago's most conflicted alderman\" by the ''''. Burke abstains from at least a few votes at almost every Finance Committee meeting.\n\nIn March 1997, weeks after hiring defense attorney Valukus, and days after learning from the '''' of their investigation into Burke's law firm and clients, Burke invoked a rarely used motion to amend the proceedings of the city council to change to abstentions four \"yes\" votes regarding airport facility leases for  and  airlines, two of Burke's seven airline clients. Burke blamed the recording of his \"aye\" votes on the late Alderman Thomas Cullerton, who chaired the City Council Committee on Aviation, which reviews airport leases. Cullerton had died in February 1993, three months before Burke cast one of the votes he changed. At the July 2, 1997, City Council meeting, Burke changed to abstention a June 4, 1997, vote in favor of a property-tax break for another client, Heinemann's Inc., a baked goods company in Burke's 14th ward. Between 1993 and 1997, Burke put through six journal corrections on his votes, some dating back seven years, and accounting for more than half the corrections from all aldermen during that period. In 2004, Burke changed the record of a vote in support of a  change favorable to another of his clients, Centrum Properties.\n\nBurke's corrections of his voting history were criticized by other aldermen and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. Daley suggested Burke was involved in conflicts of interest that merited investigation by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission and the City Board of Ethics, and Daley advocated more stringent regulation regarding aldermanic conflicts of interest. Burke's conflicts of interest inspired a strengthening of the City's ethics laws in October 1998. The Council passed the ordinance, 40–9. Burke voted \"no\" in a voice vote, then switched to \"yes\" for the record.\n\n\n\nIn October 1997, as Huels resigned in the SDI scandal, and amid calls for Burke's resignation, Burke sponsored a resolution exonerating Kate O'Leary and her cow Daisy of culpability for the  of 1871. The resolution cited research blaming the fire on an O'Leary neighbor, Daniel \"Peg Leg\" Sullivan. Burke argued in favor of passage of the resolution,\n\nIn 1871, journalists, eager to sensationalize the events of the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy scapegoat for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify  who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.\n\nThe resolution was unanimously recommended by the city council's Police and Fire Committee on October 6, 1997, and passed unanimously by the full city council on October 28, 1997. Other Burke legislative initiatives include protecting non-smokers from second-hand smoke, mandating , and regulating fatty restaurant food.\n\n\nIn April 1999,  priest and activist , pastor of St. Sabina parish in Chicago's  neighborhood, wrote a letter to Chicago Police Superintendent Terry Hilliard complaining of the glorification of violence on '''', a popular television show which was produced in Chicago. Burke showed about ten minutes of clips from the show at the April 28, 1999, meeting of the city council's Police and Fire Committee and convinced aldermen to invite, under threat of , show host  to testify under oath as to whether the violence on the show was genuine or scripted. If scripted, Burke proposed to force the show to obtain a city entertainment license, and, if genuine, Burke proposed that the off-duty Chicago policemen providing security at the show arrest fighting guests on the set.\n\nThe hearing attracted more than 21 television news crews from around the country, including , , , a film crew from ''The Jerry Springer Show,'' dozens of print reporters, and about 75 of Springer's fans. Burke led the questioning of Springer. None of the aldermen asked Springer if the violence was staged until more than an hour into the three-hour hearing. Springer, a former Cincinnati council member and mayor, spent most of his time sparring with Burke, and handled the inquiry.\n\n\n\nBurke is the only Chicago alderman who has  officers assigned to him as . In 1986, Mayor Washington's acting Chicago police commissioner Fred Rice tried to reduce the number of Burke's bodyguards from four to two, on the basis that the manpower was no longer necessary. Burke sued the city, arguing that the move was a political retaliation. The court sided with Burke. Rice removed nearly all the aldermanic bodyguards, but was blocked by court orders from taking away the Vrdolyak and Burke contingents. For nine months in 2005, the police details assigned to the city clerk, city treasurer and Burke did not file any police reports. Andy Shaw, president and chief executive of the watchdog group , asked,\n\nThis is a city that doesn't have enough money for basic services right now and doesn't have enough money to protect regular citizens. The question has to be asked whether a full-time bodyguard detail to one alderman who hasn't been shown to be in any kind of danger for more than two decades is warranted.\n\nAn unmarked Chicago police car was assigned to Burke's city-funded security detail. He is one of several aldermen who lease s at taxpayer expense.\n\n\nIn November 2014, Burke surpassed  as the longest-serving alderman in Chicago history. Coughlin, who had served from 1892 until his death in 1938, had held the record with 46 years.\n\n\nAccording the '''' in October 2023, Burke's political prominence did not come through mainly being a loyalist to the Chicago Mayor's office, but rather through the \"army of allies\" he placed in city jobs, and which served as his \"personal intelligence network.\" It was noted that \"Even mayors who despised Burke didn’t dare to depose him as chairman of the council’s Finance Committee, fearing the potential he had to stymie their legislative agendas.\"\n\n\nA criminal complaint was filed against Burke on January 2, 2019, for attempted extortion.\n\n\nOn December 21, 2023, Burke was found guilty on 13 of 14 counts of racketeering, bribery, and extortion. Developer Charles Cui was also convicted, while Burke's aide Peter Andrews was acquitted.  Burke turned 80 on December 29, 2023.\n\nThe  sought an interim suspension of Burke's license to practice law. The  denied this motion because it was unable to obtain a quorum since a majority of the seven justices  themselves from the matter.\n\n\nOn June 24, 2024, Burke was sentenced to two years in federal prison and given a $2 million fine.\n\n\n, Burke sought the Democratic nomination for Cook County . Burke was aligned with Mayor Byrne and was endorsed by the Cook County Democratic Central Committee. Burke's loss in the  to  was interpreted at the time as a set-back for the Chicago .\n\nIn 1988, following the sudden death in office of Mayor Harold Washington, Burke was one of several candidates who sought to fill the vacancy in . \"I know I would like to be Mayor. It is obviously the Super Bowl of Chicago politics,\" Burke said. After polls showed declining support for his candidacy, he dropped out of the race in December 1988 and endorsed Richard M. Daley, who won the nomination in the February 1989 Democratic primary.\n\n\n\nBurke was the lead partner in a Chicago law firm, Klafter and Burke, that specializes in representing clients in property tax appeals before the Cook County Assessor's Office, the Cook County Board of Review, and in the courts. The firm was successful in several \"significant legal challenges\" to Illinois real estate law. Burke's law firm's senior partner, Melvin Klafter, died on June 5, 1988, at age 73. The number of tax appeals Burke's firm filed for clients with the Board of Tax Appeals increased from 212 in 1982 to 1,876 in 1995. In 2002, Burke helped pass a city ordinance barring the city from contesting property tax appeals seeking a reduction in property assessment of under $1&nbsp;million, which was most of Burke's cases. Between 2003 and 2013, Burke's firm won more than $18.1&nbsp;million in property-tax refunds in Chicago.\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Burke reflected,\n\nThe law business is good. I have been fortunate to have the best of both worlds. I have enjoyed the political side of it and also enjoyed my private legal practice. Yes, there have been temptations, [but] if you try to conduct yourself under the rules, in the long run you are better off.\n\nAs of August 2019, Burke is no longer a partner with the law firm. According to the Illinois Secretary of State's office, he filed to withdraw himself as lead partner in April, a month before his federal indictment for bribery, racketeering, and extortion so he could increase more business for his former law firm. His daughter, Jennifer and two other attorneys took over his lead partnership.\n\n\n\nBurke's wife Anne has served as an  Justice and was installed as an  Justice on July 4, 2006. The Burkes reside in the southwestern Chicago neighborhood of , close to  and the  of the . Their adult children are Jennifer, Edward, and Sarah. Jennifer is an attorney who worked in the City of Chicago Law Department under Mayor Richard M. Daley's corporation counsel and now is on the Illinois Pollution Control Board. Edward M. Burke Jr. was an assistant chief deputy to Cook County Sheriff . He resigned while under investigation for misconduct and was separately charged with domestic battery in 2019. In 2004, Burke's son Emmett, aged 30, was killed in a snowmobiling accident.\n\nBurke's brother  was previously a member of the  from Illinois' 23rd District, which includes the 14th ward, as well as a lobbyist to Chicago City Hall. '''' in 2006 named Edward, Daniel, and Anne one of \"Illinois' most influential families\" and in 2013 named Edward and Anne one of Chicago's \"15 clout-heavy clans.\"\n\nNoted for his impeccable conservative suits and attention to , Burke was named \"Best Dressed Alderman\" in a 1981 review of aldermen by the '''''s City Hall reporters. Burke is also a licensed  in Illinois.\n\n\n\nIn February 1996, the Burkes became s to an  child, known in public by his court name \"Baby T\", born to a woman suffering . The child's mother, Tina Olison, an addict in recovery, sued to regain custody of her child several times in a protracted, racially charged court battle that drew extensive media attention. The suits ultimately reached the , which ruled in favor of custody for the Burkes in 2001.\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*  on the Legislative Information Center of the Chicago City Clerk\n* \n*  interview on ''End of Watch'' at the  on April 17, 2008\n* , video of  luncheon, June 18, 2012\n*   archive at the ''''\n* \n*  archive at the ''''\n*  channel on \n*  in  of the 's  Center for Oral History\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The racial discrimination leading to her mother's death impacted Langford's life and her involvement with the . Her mother, who was white, was taken to an Ohio hospital while suffering from . However, when her children, including Anna, who were , came to visit their sick mother, the hospital immediately ordered her transferred to another hospital for African Americans. Langford's mother suffered a burst appendix while en route to the second hospital and did not survive.  After the passing of her mother, she was raised by her grandmother. Langford moved to Chicago, Illinois, at age thirteen to live with her aunt and uncle. She graduated from  in 1935 and later . She enrolled at  and became a  in 1956. As a black and female attorney she was refused office space in downtown Chicago and as a result set up a neighborhood practice in the Park Manor neighborhood of Chicago with already established criminal defense and family law attorneys Norman Robinson and Muriel Farmer to start the firm Robinson Farmer and Langford. She later opened her own practice at 1249 west 63rd in Englewood where she served a poor and diverse client group.\n\n\nLangford became intimately involved in the Civil Rights Movement, both within the  and nationwide. She spent several weeks in rural Mississippi as a volunteer attorney at the office where three civil rights workers were kidnapped and murdered by suspected members of the KKK. Later Langford met with  in the  of her home in 1966 to plan a march on  to promote  within the .  Langford ran for a seat on the  in 1971 after losing in her first attempt four years earlier.

She was Evanston's third female mayor and second Democratic mayor.\n\n\nTisdahl has held many civic posts throughout her almost four decades of living in Evanston. She helped to found the Mothers Against Gangs School Liaison in 1987 and served on the Evanston Community Foundation Advisory Committee from 1987 to 1995. She spent twelve years on the  Board of Education beginning in 1989, serving two of those years as the President of that organization. She then became the alderman of Evanston's 7th Ward, an  position she held from 2003 until her election as mayor in 2009.\n\nShe attended  but did not graduate, according to a 2008 interview. She worked as an investment analyst.\n\nShe and her family live in Evanston.

She won in a four-candidate election.\n\n\nSince she became mayor, Tisdahl has simultaneously come under criticism and received praise for cracking down on alcohol consumption while loosening the penalties for drug use within Evanston city limits.

The bar was repeatedly cited for underage drinking and noise violations and had been the site of a shooting in 2005.\n\nShe has faced further criticism from the Northwestern community for the proposed enforcement of a city ordinance called variously the \"three-unrelated rule\" and the \"brothel law.\" The over-occupancy ordinance \"prohibits more than three unrelated people from living together in a residential unit,\" affecting students who are usually unrelated to one another while leaving residential families untouched. Once again, many Evanston residents favor the change while Northwestern students largely see it as a form of discrimination targeted at students.\n\nIn her time as mayor, Tisdahl has also initiated a series of anti-crime (specifically anti-gang) programs like a gun buyback initiative in an attempt to curb rising rates of violent crime.\n\nTisdahl announced in 2016 that she would not seek a third term as mayor, and in 2017 endorsed businessman  to succeed her.

Shimkus voted in favor of the .\n\n\n* ''''''\n** \n** \n**  (Ranking Member)\n** \n* ''''''\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n and regional levee concerns with Congressman  and ,  official]]\n\nOn March 25, 2009, in introductory remarks made to , during a  hearing, he made the following statement regarding the role of  in :\n\nIt's plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.\n\nShimkus has quoted the Bible to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood. He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on \"something that you cannot stop versus the changes that have been occurring forever\".\n\n\nShimkus has been a proponent of legislation to increase the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was passed by Congress and signed by the president. Of the bill, he said: \"When you're talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority.\"\n\n\nIn May 2013, Shimkus stated he would renew his support for the . The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian  through the Midwest, including Illinois. As a supporter, he stated that he would rather see Canada as an energy partner than ship in oil from overseas.\n\n\nShimkus spoke positively of President 's 2017  to temporarily curtail immigration from specified countries until better screening methods are devised. He stated that \"This temporary halt will give Congress and the new Administration time to evaluate and improve the vetting process, and in the meantime gives Secretary Kelly authority to grant exceptions to the restrictions as needed. One of those exceptions must be to green card holders, who have already undergone extensive screening.\" In October 2019, he criticized Trump for withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, and resigned as a co-chair for Trump's 2020 campaign in Illinois.\n\n\nShimkus has a \"D\" rating from marijuana legalization advocacy group  for his voting history regarding -related causes.\n\n\nIn 1992, while still serving as Madison County treasurer, he won the Republican nomination to run for the U.S. House seat in what was then the 20th district. He was defeated by 10-year   .\n\nFour years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the . Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced   in a close general election, which Shimkus won by just over 1,200 votes.\n\nHowever, he would never face another general election contest nearly that close. He faced only one credible Democratic opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th district, then held by two-term Democratic representative . The new district retained Phelps' district number, but was geographically and demographically more similar to the old 20th district, as Shimkus retained 60% of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other's staffers of stalking their families. Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, with Democrats flipping the Governorship and State Senate, Shimkus defeated Phelps with 55% of the vote. This was the only time he received below 60% in a reelection bid.\n\nShimkus announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge  when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.\n\nIn 2012, Shimkus' district was renumbered as the 15th district after Illinois lost another district. It lost much of its northern portion to the , previously numbered as 15th, which was ultimately won by his former projects director, . The old 19th had been trending Republican over the years, like southern Illinois as a whole. However, the new 15th was, on paper, one of the most Republican districts in the Midwest. Shimkus was reelected four more times from this district with over 70 percent of the vote.\n\nWhen seeking his 11th term , Shimkus faced Illinois   in the Republican primary. McCarter ran to the  of Shimkus and criticized his accommodation with the Obama administration as well as national Republican party leadership. No other party even put up a candidate, meaning whoever won the primary would be assured of victory in November. Shimkus won the primary with 60.4% of the vote to McCarter's 39.6%. He then won the general election unopposed.\n\nFEC records show that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader  in 2005. The fund also made contributions to , a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 6th district, from 2005 to 2008 and to , a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 8th district, in 2006. In 2006, the funds treasurer, lobbyist Mark Valente, resigned. Shimkus earlier said he was considering removing Valente, but he did not want to act too quickly because it might suggest there was something improper about their relationship.Meinert, Dori. , , March 9, 2006\n\n\nThe  was disbanded after the  due to reapportionment and Illinois' loss of a U.S. House seat, which is why Shimkus faced , incumbent of the 19th district, in the 2002 election. The 19th district was disbanded after the , so Shimkus ran in the redistricted 15th district.

After failing to challenge the nomination papers of Chandler, Deer went on to come in third place behind Alderman Chandler and Joe Ann Bradley, a co-founder of Citizen's Action Group which worked towards eliminating prostitution in North Lawndale.\n\nIn 2007, Deer filed to run for 24th ward Democratic  in the 2008 primary, but withdrew as a candidate after facing a challenge to his nominating papers.\n\nDeer served as the president of County Commissioner  fundraising committee until Steele's death in 2017 and considered Steele to be a mentor. He was also the chairman of an anti-violence task force that Steele's 2nd County District Community Advisory Council created with  .\n\n\n   died on June 19, 2017, due to complications related to .

After appearing as a candidate, Conyears ultimately left prior to interviewing.\n\nDeer received endorsements from the chairman of the replacement committee, Alderman Scott Jr., and from the Steele family.

Deer won over the committee as a life-long community member who could build on the work of Robert Steele. As the former president of Steele's fundraising committee, he said \"We already know how to raise money.

After initially supporting the tax at the time of his appointment, Deer ultimately voted for the successful repeal of the tax on October 11, 2017.\n\n\nOn July 25, 2019, the Board of Commissioners passed Deer's resolution declaring racism and racial inequalities a public health crisis in Cook County. The resolution was intended to encourage growth in public health support networks to work towards decreases in racial disparities in health outcomes.

The amendment prohibited landlords from denying housing applications based on arrest records or convictions that are more than 3 years old and required an individualized assessment of convictions less than 3 years old for otherwise qualified applicants. Deer decided he wanted to champion this issue as someone who is both a landlord and works with ex-incarcerated men and women. He stated, \"There's no room for double jeopardy. People should not be required to pay over and over and over again for a crime they committed when they were 19.\"\n\n\nAs a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Deer served on multiple committees of both the Board of Commissioners and the .\n\n\n* ''Asset Management''\n* ''Business and Economic Development''\n* ''Criminal Justice''\n* ''Contract Compliance''\n* ''Emergency Management and Regional Security''\n* ''Environment and Sustainability'' (Chairman)\n* ''Finance''\n* ''Health and Hospitals'' (Chairman)\n* ''Human Relations'' (Chairman)\n* ''Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations''\n* ''Rules and Administration''\n* ''Technology and Innovation''\n* ''Transportation''\n* ''Veterans''\n* ''Zoning and Building''\n\n* ''Botanic Garden''\n* ''Capital Development''\n* ''Contract Compliance''\n* ''Environment and Sustainability'' (Vice Chairman)\n* ''Finance'' (Vice Chairman)\n* ''Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations''\n* ''Real Estate''\n* ''Recreation''\n* ''Rules''\n* ''Zoological''\n\n\nDeer and his wife, Barbara, had three children.

She ultimately finished in second place out of three candidates, with 20.12% of the vote, 51 points behind Daley.\n\nBrown ran for  in . At one point, she led the Democratic field in at ''Chicago Tribune'' poll. However, she ultimately lost the Democratic primary to , placing third out of four candidates, behind Preckwinkle and Terrence J. O'Brien. Brown received 14.45% of the vote.\n\nDespite the scandals she had faced, Brown attempted to run for mayor of Chicago in , but was removed from the ballot for failing to complete the required paperwork. Following her removal from the ballot, Brown endorsed  for mayor. However, Enyia failed to qualify for the , which was won by .\n\n\nBrown was characterized as running an office full of  hires. In 2014 the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' described the Clerk's office as \"a 2,300-employee office, one of the last true bastions of political  in Illinois\".\n\nBeginning in August 2018, a federally-ordered monitor was appointed under to audit the hiring and employment practices of Brown's office in an effort to monitor the office's compliance with the . This federal oversight of the office's hiring and employment practices would not cease until November 2022, during the tenure of Brown's successor.\n\nIn 2015, an employee of Brown's office testified that the \"going rate\" for a job in Brown's office was $10,000.\n\n\nWhen she first campaigned for the office in 2000, Brown promised that she would make sure that the clerk's office kept pace with new technology. However, Brown was seen as falling significantly short of this promise in her tenure. In 2014, Natasha Korecki of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' described Brown as, \"synonymous with questionable ethics and woefully outdated technology.\" In 2017, the editorial board of the ''Chicago Tribune'' characterized Brown as leading a, \"patronage-packed office...stuck in a land that time forgot,\" with a, \"well-earned reputation as a fortress of inefficiency.\" In 2024, journalist Gregory Pratt recalled, }}\n\nProjects and services developed under Brown's leadership include: Two Electronic filing (e-filing), a Clerk of the Circuit Court mobile app:  \"Court Clerk Mobile Connect,\" an Online Traffic Ticket Payment System, an Electronic Tickets (eTickets) system, Mortgage Surplus Search, SmartForms (Online Order of Protection service), Smart Kiosks (court information terminals), and IDMS (Imaging Document Management System).\n\nBrown was criticized by advocacy groups who alleged a failure to sufficiently modernize the court system. The court's case management system had been characterized as \"archaic\". In 2012, the editorial board of the ''Chicago Tribune'' criticized Brown for, \"years of failed assurances to modernize the obsolete, paper-choked office she heads.\"\n\nBrown numerous times failed to meet deadlines for the modernization of the court's filing system. In late-2017, Brown announced that an e-filing system that the  had mandated be created for lawsuits and other civil cases was ready to be launched. However, a month after this, Brown called-off the launch and requested that the court allow a delay. The eventual July 2018 rollout of the electronic filing for civil cases was plagued by confusion and disorder. \n\nA partial system update that digitized criminal courts filing was first phased-in in November 2019, but proved to be problematic. This update led to the records it made available often  being incomplete incomplete and taking longer to be updated. This proved so problematic that the court itself in October 2020 ordered that Brown halt its implementation.\n\n\nFor much of her tenure, Brown was criticized for failing to provide stored records that had been requested in a timely fashion.\n\nIn May 2018, The '''' detailed how the removal of documents case files to warehouses as part of the slow-moving effort to digitize documents had placed more 600 s cases in flux due to the unavailability of needed documents. At this time, the Illinois Appellate Defender's Office called delays in obtaining records from the Brown's office was an \"ongoing problem\".\n\nIn June 2020, Legal Aid Chicago filed a lawsuit accusing Brown's office of, during the , failing to provide  and  survivors with copies of their  immediately after they had been granted, which the office had a statutory duty to do. The lawsuit by Legal Aid Chicago further accused Brown's office of failing to transmit such orders top the  in a timely fashion so that they could be entered into that office's Law Enforcement Agency Data System. The lawsuit argued that these alleged failures on the part of Brown's office endangered survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. \n\nAlso during the pandemic, Brown received criticism for failure to mail out the notices in a timely fashion to tell individuals that their court appearances would be conducted virtually, with some notices having been mailed out after the date of the court appearances had already passed. When questioned by  on this, Brown alleged that “unconscious racism” was at the root of both that story, and other negative stories reported on her during her tenure.\n\n\nAmid theCOVID-19 pandemi, Brown received criticism from courts clerks and the clerks' union, who argued she was not doing enough to protect them and the public amid the pandemic. Some clerks walked off the job. Brown faced lawsuits for her alleged failure to send out notices of virtual hearings in a timely fashion, and for failing to produce documents in a required timely fashion.\n\nIn November 2020, Brown was caught by WGN-TV holding a retirement party that appeared to possibly violate the city and state's 50-person limit on gatherings amid the pandemic.\n\n\nIn 2024, the editorial board of the '''' recollected, }}\n\nIn 2012, the ''Chicago Tribune'' published a report documenting in excess of $315,000 of political donations which Brown had accepted from employees of her office and at least $75,000 which she had accepted from relatives of employees. After winning election to a fourth term several months later, Brown promised to stop accepting campaign contributions from her employees.\n\nIn May 2006, Brown chaired the host committee for a Chicago  to support the reelection of Mayor  of , .  contractor Mark St. Pierre, who had worked contracts for both the city of New Orleans and Cook County government and  to both Brown and Nagin's political campaigns, organized the event. Nagin was  on  charges on January 18, 2013, with the fundraiser being cited in the indictment. He was convicted in 2014.\n\n\nBrown accepted cash gifts on her birthday and Christmas from her employees. In 2008 Brown announced that she would no longer accept the gifts after questions arose regarding how she claimed the items.\n\nIn January 2010, the Inspector General of Cook County investigated Brown's \"Jeans Day\" program, in which Clerk's office employees could donate cash to the Jeans Day fund and wear casual clothing to work on a Friday. The Jeans Day fund, which grew to over $300,000, was supposed to be used to fund employee morale activities and charities. The Inspector General's report documented expenditures unrelated to charitable causes, including  tickets,  tickets, and employee parking reimbursements. The Inspector General's report cleared Brown's office of wrongdoing, but advised Brown provide better controls. Brown discontinued Jeans Day in August 2010.\n\n\nIn June 2011, a contributor to Brown's political campaigns gave a commercial property at the intersection of Pulaski, Ogden and Cermak Avenues on Chicago's southwest side to Brown's husband. Two months later, the deed was transferred to The Sankofa Group, L. L. C., Brown and her husband's for-profit consulting firm, and in November 2011 The Sankofa Group sold the property for $100,000. The Cook County  and by a  convened by prosecutors with the Cook County 's office opened an investigation of the land deal.\n\nIn 2014, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' reported that the Chicago Area Project, which had employed Brown's husband, was the subject of a criminal probe by a . Ethics concerns related to  were raised by the newspaper, which noted that signatures on documents indicated that Brown had directly involved herself in her office's the handling of the probe's . The newspaper also alleged that Brown had been involved in securing the granting of sizable amount of money to the group from the Illinois state government.\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that a campaign donor, Naren Patel, had given Brown's husband a parcel of land for $1. Brown's name was later added to paperwork and Sankofa Group (a private entity once registered to Brown's home) ended up on the title. Brown and her husband sold the land for $100,000. Brown did not disclose the land as a gift or donation on state economic interest forms. In October 2015, the FBI executed a search warrant at Brown's home and seized her County-issued cell phone. Chicago attorney  represented Brown at the time.\n\nIn November 2015, a federal indictment alleged that a clerk's office employee had been rehired by the Clerk's office weeks after lending $15,000 to a company controlled by Brown's husband, then lied to a federal grand jury about the incident. The employee pleaded guilty in 2016, and claimed that the \"going rate\" for a job in the office had been $10,000.\n\nIn 2018, a federal probe detailed accounts of alleged job-buying in Brown's office.\n\nIn March 2019, a federal indictment charged Donald Danagher with bribery, alleging a pay-for-contract scheme which involved making donations to Brown's campaign and scholarship funds in exchange for his debt collection business receiving a contract.\n\nOn April 26, 2019, a jury convicted former Brown aide Beena Patel, who had supervised approximately 500 employees in the clerk's office, of perjury concerning her federal grand jury testimony in 2015 and 2016. In November 2019, court documents evidenced that Patel's perjury had protected Brown against prosecution.\n\nIn October 2021, Donald Donagher Jr., the former chief executive officer of a debt-collection company, admitted in federal court that he had made payments to support a Women's History Month program run by Brown in an effort to reward Brown for business he believed she had directed to him.\n\n\nIn late 2019, Brown's office had a class-action lawsuit brought against it alleging that it had charged illegal fees to people seeking child support enforcement.\n\nLegal Aid Wisconsin filed a lawsuit over Brown's failure to produce documents in a timely fashion as legally required during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also faced a separate lawsuit alleging failure to send notices of virtual hearings in a timely fashion during the pandemic.\n\n\nAfter her successor as clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, , was critical of the shape of the office she inherited from Brown, on December 17, 2020, Brown released a three-page statement to WGN-TV which was highly critical of Martinez. Brown accused Martinez of refusing attempts she had made to assist Martinez's transition into office. Brown wrote that Martinez, \"obviously does not have a plan or a clue how to run the office.\"\n\nBrown's statement included comments which attacked Martinez for hiring  individuals to management, writing, \"Iris Martinez's administration does not look the racial make-up of Cook County, but it looks like Puerto Rico\". The statement accused Martinez and her staff of, \"showing disrespect to the  language, and the English-speaking staff, by only communicating in , when non-Spanish speaking staff are present.\"\n\nBrown received $5,000 for consulting services to the 2021  mayoral campaign of . Henyard considers Brown to be her mentor. Brown then led the transition team after Heynard was elected mayor. From October 2021 until December 31, 2021, Brown served as  of Dolton, having been appointed by Heynard. The hiring of Brown to the six-figure position sparked criticism from several Dolton city trustees.\n\n\nIn 2013, Brown was an honoree awarded at the \"125 Alumni of Distinction Reception\" held by the Chicago-Kent College of Law. In 2021, Brown was inducted into Southern University's Black College Alumni Hall of Fame. She has received professional achievement awards from both of these alma maters. Other honors that Brown has received include the Marks of Excellence Award from the National Forum for Black Public Administrators, the Women of Achievement Award from the , and the Justinian Society of Lawyers Humanitarian Award.\n\n\nBrown is married to Benton Cook, who is a convicted .\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# \n# \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n* news and investigations by the , an Illinois watchdog group\n* archive at the ''''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He currently serves as Deputy Governor for Illinois Governor ’s administration. Prior to assuming that role, Mitchell represented the 26th District of Illinois as state representative from 2013 to 2019. He also served as the executive director of the  during the 2018 election cycle, becoming the first African-American to hold the position.\n\nMitchell began his career as a community organizer, working with churches on the south side of Chicago and is an advisor to many reform-minded political leaders.\n\n\nMitchell was raised by his mother, a retired nurse, and his grandfather, who was a union steelworker and an elder at his church in Maywood. Mitchell cites his mother's dedication and sacrifice as well as his grandfather's service as his inspiration to become a public servant.\n\nMitchell attended the , graduating in 2008 with a B.A. in public policy. He later earned a J.D. at  in 2019.\n\nMitchell began his career as a faith-based community organizer with Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation (SOUL). His work with SOUL focused on education funding reform, affordable housing, and economic empowerment for low-income communities. In 2009, Mitchell drafted legislation that became the Urban Weatherization Initiative, a $425 million program designed to put people to work weatherproofing houses in Chicago.\n\nIn 2010, Mitchell worked as a deputy field director for Illinois Attorney General 's reelection campaign and managed ' successful campaign for alderman of the . He was a senior advisor to Cook County President  from May 2011 to November 2011, serving as Director of Outreach and External Relations. Preckwinkle credits Mitchell with keeping the  sales tax repeal from unravelling in the  budgeting process. Mitchell was named to -elect 's transition team in March 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Mitchell acted as the Midwest director of Paid Media and Polling for President 's reelection campaign. He worked as a senior vice president at The Strategy Group from 2014 to 2017, executing strategic communications plans for  candidates across the United States. Christian has consulted for State Assembly and Congressional races across the country and was a senior advisor on Senator ’s successful 2016 campaign and Governor ’s successful 2018 campaign.\n\n\nMitchell was first elected to the  in November 2012 and was sworn into office in January 2013. He was the youngest member of the 98th General Assembly. Mitchell was reelected to his seat in 2014, 2016, and 2018.\n\nAs a legislator, Mitchell was a leader in the fight to reform Illinois’ broken education funding formula. He worked diligently to pass the bill that increased resources for poor schools across the state by billions of dollars. In his capacity as , Mitchell fought to increase funding and access to state colleges. Mitchell also worked tirelessly to reform Illinois’ justice system: passing a law requiring background checks for private handgun sales, playing an important role in passing bills to reform the broken relationship between our communities and police, and leading the fight to decriminalize and legalize marijuana. He is a vocal advocate for a woman's right to choose and affordable healthcare for everyone.\n\n\nChairmanships and vice-chairmanships:\n* House Committee on Economic Opportunity (chairperson)\n* House Committee on Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, and IT (Vice-chairperson)\n\nCommittee assignments:\n* Appropriations – Higher Education Committee\n* Judiciary – Criminal Committee\n* State Government Administration Committee\n\nSubcommittee assignments:\n* Appropriations – Cost Analysis Subcommittee\n* Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, and IT – Distributed Ledgers and Cryptocurrency Subcommittee\n* Judiciary – Criminal Administration and Enforcement Subcommittee\n* Judiciary – Firearms and Firearm Safety Subcommittee\n* Judiciary – Sex Offenses and Sex Offender Registration Subcommittee\n\n\n* Black Caucus\n\n\nMitchell was one of the most progressive members of the . On March 3, 2014, the ''''  described Mitchell as \"just what his constituents need: a smart, hardworking lawmaker whose first priority is to look out for them.\" He is known as someone who shows a deep understanding of Illinois' problems as well as a lawmaker who proposes a wide range of solutions.\n\n\nAs a State Representative, Mitchell consistently supported legislation to direct more state funds to K-12 schools. In the 99th General Assembly, he proposed the Fund Education First Act as a long-term solution to restore education funding in Illinois. The Fund Education First Act is projected to increase investment in Chicago Public Schools by $200 million without increasing local property taxes. In the long term, the proposed legislation will generate an additional $1 billion in funding to schools statewide. On Wednesday, October 30, 2013, Mitchell told Dartesia Pitts on CAN TV's Political Forum that he views \"education as the key to opportunity, as a ladder out of poverty, as the thing that got me to the place where I am\".\n\nIn his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Economic Opportunity, Mitchell toured the state's universities during the 2015-2017 budget impasse, bringing attention to the economic importance of higher education to communities all across the state.  Mitchell highlighted the ability of colleges and universities to serve as anchor institutions – attracting new residents, providing employees for local businesses, and supporting local shops and restaurants. \"The impacts are real and they are direct on the lives of real people,\" he said.\n\nMitchell consistently advocated increased state funding for schools, and particularly districts with large numbers of low-income students. He was a strong supporter of education funding reforms passed by the General Assembly in 2017, which increased state funding for education by $350 million – including $60 million for Chicago Public Schools. However, Governor  vetoed the bill, and demanded $75 million in tax credits for private schools in exchange for his signature. Mitchell continued to advocate for increased school funding, but voted against the amended bill proposed by Gov. Rauner, denouncing the tax credits as vouchers by another name. Mitchell said: \"[The bill] incentivizes the wealthiest citizens - instead of paying their fair share of taxes to fund public education - to take a tax break that will pull resources out of our public schools, and away from the funds that invest in infrastructure, human services, and property tax relief…public education is too important a concept to be traded away for the money that low income school children around the state deserve.\"\n\nMitchell supported legislation to establish an elected Chicago Board of Education. Currently the School Board is appointed by the Mayor of Chicago.\n\nIn 2018, Mitchell sponsored SB 2892, a bill to raise the minimum salary for teachers in Illinois - set at $9,000 since 1980. Mitchell's bill would have raised the minimum salary for teachers to $32,076 the following year, and $40,000 by 2022. The Illinois General Assembly passed Mitchell's bill in May 2018, with bipartisan support. On August 26, 2018, Governor Bruce Rauner vetoed the bill.\n\n\nIn 2014, Mitchell called for the establishment of a Gun Trafficking Control Task Force to stop illegal guns from reaching criminals.  He introduced legislation that increases regulations on gun dealership to quell the spread of illegal guns, such as 24/7 video surveillance, mandatory background checks on employees working at gun dealerships, detailed record keeping, and zoning restrictions.  Representative Mitchell also proposed legislation calling for a 2% tax on the sale of ammunition to fund trauma centers in Illinois.\n\nIn 2018, Mitchell voted for HB 1467, a measure to ban bump stocks in Illinois. The measure was introduced after the 2017 , which was carried out by a lone gunman who used bump stocks to convert semi-automatic rifles into automatic rifles.\n\n\nMitchell is vehemently opposed to Right to Work policies. In a speech from the Illinois House floor on May 14, 2015, he opposed an initiative to create local employment empowerment zones, stating \"without unions, we wouldn't have an African American middle class. Because the African-American middle class in places like Chatham and Bronzeville was built on the backs of firefighters and teachers and unions\". He supported the Fair Arbitration Bill (SB 1229), which would have allowed the State to reach a renewed collective bargaining agreement with its unionized employees through arbitration rather than a lockout or strike.\n\nMitchell was also the chief co-sponsor of HB 2607, the Illinois Clean Jobs Bill - a bill that will reduce carbon pollution and create 32,000 new jobs in Illinois.\n\n\nRepresentative Mitchell supported numerous initiatives to relieve taxes on middle-class families in Illinois. He advocated amending the constitution to create a graduated state income tax, in which lower earners pay a lower rate and higher earners pay a higher rate. He also supported expanding the State Earned Income Tax Credit to reduce the tax burden on lower and middle income families.\n\nIn February 2015, Mitchell introduced a bill to guarantee that all workers in Illinois have the right to paid sick time. He also co-sponsored legislation which became law to expand access to SNAP benefits for families that include an elderly, disabled, or blind person.\n\nIn May 2018, Mitchell supported a bipartisan state budget. The state budget, passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Bruce Rauner, avoided property tax increases - a major selling point for Mitchell.\n\n\nIn the legislature, Mitchell has championed measures to preserve the environment and move Illinois towards a clean energy economy.\n\nMitchell was a chief co-sponsor of the Illinois Clean Jobs Bill, which will create an estimated 32,000 new jobs; lower electricity costs; and reduce the state's carbon footprint. Mitchell was a vocal supporter of a stronger Renewable Portfolio Standard, which steered a larger share of state investments to sustainable energy sources.\n\nIn 2018, Mitchell was the Chief House Sponsor of SB 3156, a bill to increase transparency around Illinois Environmental Protection Agency investigations.\n\nIn 2018, Mitchell's record on the environment earned a 100% rating from the Illinois Environmental Council. This marked the fifth time Mitchell received a 100% rating from the IEC.\n\n\nMitchell believes that state sponsored child care empowers single parents to provide for their families. In 2015, in response to Governor Rauner's drastic reduction of Illinois' child care program, Mitchell became the chief sponsor of legislation to expand state-subsidized child care to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. This legislation expands access to the program for thousands of working families, particularly single parents and is a bill that Mitchell has carried since he was sworn into the General Assembly.\n\nOn November 17, 2015, Mitchell expressed his support for expanded child-care in an interview with Paul Lisnek, saying \"I've got child care providers in my district who are shutting down. We've got businesses who are adjusting the way they do shifts because you've got so many single moms that are being crushed by the fact that they don't have child care anymore. So for us, voting for SB 570, which I was a chief co-sponsor, was insurance to say the governor can never do something like this again\".\n\nIn March 2017, Mitchell introduced HB 3595, a bill that would create tax credits to help working parents cover child care expenses. \"I think [the bill] could really be useful in moving the middle-class, lower-middle class forward in terms of having more money for child care and better quality child care in the state,\" Mitchell said of the bill.\n\n\nRepresentative Mitchell co-sponsored the Police and Community Relations Improvement Act, which expands access to body cameras, requires additional training for police officers and incorporates a measure drafted by Rep. Mitchell requiring police departments to conduct an independent investigation of police involved deaths.\n\nMitchell is an ardent supporter of criminal justice reform, recognizing the disproportionate effect current drug laws have on minority communities. He co-sponsored HB 218, legislation to decriminalize marijuana by eliminating criminal penalties associated with the possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana. The Illinois Department of Corrections projected this bill would reduce Illinois' prison population by 115 inmates and save $29,335,700 over 10 years. Governor Rauner vetoed the bill in August 2015.\n\n\nIn July 2018, Mitchell was named Interim Executive Director of the , the first African American serve in the role. &nbsp;As Executive Director, Mitchell traveled to every corner of the state, listening to and soliciting feedback from voters on how they’d like to see the party grow and continue its record of electing Democrats in Illinois.\n\nWorking closely with the Democratic Party Chairman and the members of the Democratic State Central Committee, Mitchell took significant steps to increase Democratic performance in the 2018 elections. In concert with J.B. Pritzker's campaign for Governor, the Party launched a $1 million voter registration program; executed a massive vote-by-mail program, targeting nearly two million eligible voters to ensure broader access and engagement during the traditional “drop-off” (non-presidential) midterm election year; and increased data sharing among campaigns from the top of the ticket to the bottom, giving down-ballot races access to additional data from which they could produce more sophisticated targeting and better-coordinated field operations.\n\nMitchell also hired a full time voter protection coordinator and created a voter protection hotline at the start of Illinois’ early voting period, creating the most sustained and far reaching voter protection effort in the state's history.\n\nUnder Mitchell's leadership, the Party spent more than $27M to support over 100 Democratic candidates and local Democratic party organizations in Illinois.  As a result, Democrats achieved gains up and down the ticket, including the election of  as Governor, securing two additional congressional seats, three additional state senate seats, and earning a super-majority in the state house and state senate - a “wave” election that would later be cited as “changing the course of Illinois politics.”\n\n'''2018 Election / Democratic '''\n\n\n\nOn December 20, 2018,  announced Mitchell would be a Deputy Governor in his administration. Mitchell resigned from the  on January 11, 2019, to assume the position.\n\nAs Deputy Governor, Mitchell works to carry out initiatives set forth by the Pritzker Administration. His primary areas of focus are the Environment, Infrastructure, and Public Safety. The state agencies and departments under his oversight include the , Capital Development Board, , , , , Department of Innovation and Technology, , and .\n\nDuring what was regarded as Springfield's \"most momentous legislative session in decades\", Mitchell was instrumental in the passage of HB , Illinois Cannabis Control , which legalizes the adult use of cannabis in Illinois effective January 1, 2020. Mitchell, in concert with the sponsors and caucuses of color, not only worked to ensure that HB  would generate much needed revenue, but also guaranteed that the Act was rooted in equality and justice.\n\nThe Illinois bill is noted for wrapping in \"significant criminal justice reform\" through a combination of clemency and expungement for a half million individuals that have been convicted of minor offenses. Criminal justice experts have referred to Illinois’ law as a possible “roadmap.” The bill also prioritizes social equity for potential business owners in the cannabis industry, including preference in licensing and a loan fund for owners disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs. Industry experts applaud actions taken by the Illinois legislature for “marrying increased opportunity, increased access [to] points of sale, while at the same time really giving the current operators, the current infrastructure the opportunity to be first to market.”\n\nOther components of the law will expand mental health and addiction recovery services and reinvest in economic development, violence prevention, youth services, re-entry programs, and legal aid. The passage of HB  makes Illinois the eleventh state in the nation to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and the first state to pass it through a general assembly vote instead of a ballot measure.\n\nAlso during the 2019 legislative session, Mitchell spearheaded efforts that led to the passage of “Rebuild Illinois”, the first-of-its-kind $45B Capital Construction Program. The historic program is projected to create over 500,000 jobs and put Illinois on a path to economic recovery by investing billions in the state's infrastructure, mass transit, and universities and schools throughout Illinois. It will also fund environmental and flood mitigation programs, economic development, and expand access to broadband in rural areas. The bill also creates a requirement that 10 percent of hours worked on state construction projects be worked by apprentices - a key component for advancing diversity - and sets goals for minority participation.\n\nDuring Governor Pritzker's first legislative session, the legislature also passed an amendment proposal to the state constitution to allow for the implementation of SB 687, a bill which would (given approval through a state referendum) implement the first progressive taxation system in Illinois, as well as the state's first agreed upon and enacted budget in a decade, a $15 minimum wage, a statewide expansion of gaming, legalization of sports betting, and passed the Reproductive Health Act, guaranteeing state funding for abortion.\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n''' for State Representative, 26th District'''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* at the Illinois General Assembly\n**\n* at Illinois House Democrats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The 14th district, which Osterman was vacating and Cassidy now represents, includes the neighborhoods of Edgewater, Andersonville, and Rogers Park. Per Illinois law, the vacancy was filled by Democratic committeemen from the wards making up the district, their votes weighted to reflect the share of the district falling in each ward. Because more than half of the 14th district's voters live in Chicago's 48th ward, that ward's committeeman – former state senator  – cast more than half of the votes. On April 17, the committeemen unanimously selected Cassidy to fill the vacancy.\n\nIn the 2012 Democratic primary, Cassidy was challenged by Paula Basta, a lesbian and longtime North Side activist.

Despite being the presumed front runner and endorsed by the outgoing State Senator, Cassidy lost the vote of committeemen to 's former policy director .

Blagojevich was later convicted in Federal court on 18 counts and sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, based on the blatancy of his attempts to use his office for personal gain. Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court upheld his convictions, on a subsequent appeal, the 7th Circuit threw out 5 of the convictions in 2015, but Blagojevich was resentenced to the same lengthy term of imprisonment.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Madigan won re-election with 72.4% of the vote against   Stewart \"Stu\" Umholtz.\n\nIn 2008, Madigan was considered a potential candidate for  or the .

He served in that office until his election as  in 1990. Since then, he has unsuccessfully run for office four more times.\n\nIllinois Governor  appointed Burris to replace   as the junior senator from Illinois. The appointment was controversial, as the governor was already under investigation and there were rumors of his being paid for the appointment. Burris succeeded Obama as the U.S. Senate's only African American member. He was briefly a candidate for election to a full term but withdrew before the Democratic primaries in the .\n\n\n in 2008]]\nBurris was born and raised in the small community of  in southern Illinois. The Burris family can trace their roots to  in the , mainly in the states of Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. He was a 1955 graduate of Centralia High School.

His tombstone reads \"TRAIL BLAZER\" and includes a list of his accomplishments, with space left for future ones.\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Burris became National Bank Examiner for the  for the .   The adversities he faced as an African-American bank examiner in the early 1960s were described in some detail in the February 2013 edition of ''SuperVisions'' (the OCC's employee newsletter).  From 1964 to 1973, he worked at  (now ), serving as tax accountant, tax consultant, commercial banking officer, and vice-president. He headed a commercial group that covered government guaranteed loans and minority business banking.\n\nIn 1973, he was appointed by Illinois Governor  as Director of the , serving through 1977.\n\nHe was National Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer for  from January to October 1977. \n\nIn 1985, Burris was selected for the position of vice-chairman of the . This decision, coming on the heels of the party's  to President , generated controversy, since Gary, Indiana Mayor , who had served as the campaign manager for presidential candidate , was the nominee of the party's Black Caucus.

There, he was the second African American ever to be elected to a  in the United States (after ). In 1985, 19-year-old  was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death along with a co-defendant in a  Circuit Court, for the  of a 10-year-old child. In 1992, Assistant Attorney General Mary Brigid Kenney, whom Burris had assigned to fight Cruz's appeal, sent Burris a memo identifying numerous errors in the investigation and trial in Cruz's initial conviction, and refusing to participate in upholding what she considered to be a . Burris ignored Kenney's warnings, and she resigned in protest, writing to Burris, \"I was being asked to help execute an innocent man...

The following year, Burris admitted that he kept a handgun in his home and had not turned it into police as he had urged others to do. A spokesman stated that Burris had \"forgotten about\" his handgun.\n\n, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for . While Burris had been favored for much of the primary campaign, he and  Board President  were both defeated by Comptroller , who had a strong late showing in the final weeks of the campaign despite being seen as the . Netsch would go down to defeat the following November against incumbent Republican Governor  in an election where Democrats lost every single race for statewide office.\n\nIn 1995, Burris ran as an independent for , losing to incumbent . In 1998, he again unsuccessfully sought the  nomination for Governor of Illinois. In that race, Burris caused a controversy by referring to his Democratic primary opponents  Jim Burns,  (who eventually won the nomination) and   as \"nonqualified white boys.\" During his 2002 run for governor against, among others, , he was supported by, among others, .\n\n\nIn the 1980s as Illinois State Comptroller, Burris's office issued a license to the Illinois Funeral Directors Association (IFDA) to manage a pre-need funeral trust fund. A provision was also issued allowing trustees to take 25% of the fund's earnings as management fees.\n\nThe fund went into deficits beginning in 2001 leading to a revocation of the IFDA license in September 2007 and a $59 million deficit by October 2008. Burris acted as a lobbyist for the IFDA trust during early 2007 through 2008. Burris has refused comment on the scandal citing \"it was 30 years ago\". Consequently, a group of funeral directors (plaintiffs in a suit filed January 2009 against the IFDA alleging a ) have subpoenaed Burris to find out his involvement during his time as lobbyist. \n\n\nBurris is manager/CEO of Burris & Lebed Consulting, LLC, which was formed in April 2002.\n\nBurris was featured briefly in a scene from the Hollywood blockbuster '''', starring .  A scene in the movie, which was mainly shot in Chicago, shows Burris in the St. Patrick's Day parade, waving to spectators.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 14, 2008, Burris suggested himself as a possible caretaker for the  seat vacated by President-elect , saying he would not run for election if appointed. Prior to this suggestion, Governor Blagojevich had been considering asking  but feared she would not take his call. This suggestion came in the wake of an  investigation regarding charges of corruption against the Governor for seeking bribes in a  scheme for the empty Senate seat and other offenses. Blagojevich says he appointed Burris because he believed Burris's ego made him the only person who would fight to be seated.\n\nBurris filed an affidavit on January 5, in advance of his testimony before the Illinois impeachment committee, in which he wrote that \"prior to the December 26, 2008, telephone call from Mr. Adams Jr., there was not any contact between myself or any of my representatives with Governor Blagojevich or any of his representatives regarding my appointment to the United States Senate.\" However, according to the FBI wiretap transcript recorded November 13, Burris told Rob Blagojevich, who was the chairman of the ex-governor's reelection campaign, that he understood that Blagojevich wanted money and that he was \"trying to figure out how to deal with this and still be in the consideration for the appointment,\" and that he was willing to \"personally do something,\" including offering to give the governor a personal check. He realized, however, that such an action might look like he was trying to buy the seat and wanted to find a way to avoid that perception.\n\nOn December 30, 2008, Governor Blagojevich announced that he was naming Burris to the seat.   registered the appointment in the official records of Illinois on December 31, 2008. However, White declined to sign the Senate's certification form.\n\nOn January 5, 2009,   rejected Burris's certificate of appointment to the Senate as invalid. Erickson cited  as the reason for the rejection. Because White had refused to sign the certificate, Erickson concluded in her findings that the certificate did not conform to Senate Rule 2.   and Illinois's senior Senator  agreed with Erickson that the Senate rule required the secretary of state's signature.\n\nReid initially said that the Senate would not seat Burris, citing , which states that \"Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members.\" Reid and other senators had previously stated, before Burris was in contention, that they would use Article I authority against any appointment by Blagojevich. The Senate also could have referred the appointment to the , thus stalling it until Blagojevich's status was settled. Some Democrats, including the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, , and the , spoke out in favor of Burris being seated.\n\nBurris appeared in Washington at the January Congressional swearing-in ceremony (January 6) to claim his seat, but was denied entry into the Senate chambers. Burris and his lawyers insisted that Burris was \"now the junior senator from the state of Illinois,\" although technically he was not a senator and could not be one until being administered the oath of office.\n\nOn January 9, 2009, the  ruled that the appointment only required the signature of the governor and the secretary of state's signature is not required to make the appointment valid. It also said Illinois is not obligated to use, and hence its Secretary of State is not required to sign, the Senate's \"recommended\" certification form. The State Supreme Court noted that a different form was available: White had already registered the appointment in Illinois's official records, and Illinois law requires the Secretary of State to provide a certified copy, with signature and seal, of any of the state's official records to anyone willing to pay the fee. It suggested that Burris simply obtain a certified copy of the appointment registration. In its ''Burris v. White'' ruling the State Supreme Court not only declared that the form of certificate contained in rule II of the Standing Rules of the United States Senate was, according to its own terms, only a ''recommended form'' but it further remarked that \"no explanation has been given as to how any rule of the Senate, whether it be formal or merely a matter of tradition, could supersede the authority to fill vacancies conferred on the states by the federal constitution\". Following the ruling, White provided Burris with a certified copy of the appointment's registration, and Burris delivered that copy, bearing the State Seal, to the . On January 12, 2009, after the Secretary of the Senate announced that she and the  deemed Burris's new credentials valid, Senate leaders decided to seat Burris. Burris was sworn in by Vice President  on January 15, 2009.\n\nBurris filed an affidavit with the Illinois House committee that oversaw Governor Blagojevich's impeachment, dated February 4, to supplement his earlier answer to a question posed by the committee. Burris acknowledged Rod Blagojevich requested \"assistance in fund-raising\" for the governor three times in the weeks and months before Blagojevich appointed Burris. Illinois House Republicans consider this to be at odds with Burris's testimony during the impeachment trial, and said they were considering pursuing a perjury investigation. Democratic officials, including  , supported an investigation. Burris stated that he told the governor's brother Rob Blagojevich that he could not donate to Gov. Blagojevich because \"it could be viewed as an attempt to curry favor with him regarding his decision to appoint a successor to President Obama\" and that he \"did not raise or donate any funds to Governor Blagojevich after the fundraiser on June 27, 2008.\"\n\nOn February 16, in comments to reporters, Burris told reporters that the governor's brother had asked him to raise ten- to fifteen-thousand dollars for the governor in October 2008. Burris said that after the phone call, he \"talked to some people about trying to see if we could put a fundraiser on,\" but that no one was willing to donate to the governor. Burris says he spoke again with the governor's brother around November 10 to tell him that his earlier efforts to raise money were unsuccessful, but that he might be able to talk other people into donating about a thousand dollars to the governor. Burris also said that around November 15 or 16, he told the governor's brother that he could not raise any money for the governor, nor would he donate to the governor himself.\n\nOn February 17,  State's Attorney's Office released a statement saying that it was investigating Burris for possible perjury charges connected to his testimony to the panel of the Illinois House of Representatives investigating the governor's impeachment. The  also reportedly was preparing a preliminary investigation into the matter.\n\nOn February 18, the '''', the state's largest newspaper, called on Burris to resign. In the editorial, the board wrote, \"His protests that he had nothing to hide just don't square with his obvious attempts to hide something.\" The editorial board of ''The '' also called for his resignation saying Burris's story has more twists than the  because Burris had offered five varying explanations, three of them under oath, of his contacts with associates of Blagojevich. Burris refused to resign his seat, despite calls to do so from new Illinois governor  and statements from fellow Illinois Senator  that Durbin would not support a Burris election bid.\n\nOn March 7, the '''' reported that   John Schmidt has asked the FBI for tapes of wiretapped phone calls between Burris and Rod Blagojevich, which he would use for his investigation of whether to charge Burris with perjury. On May 26, 2009, tapes were released from the wire taps. Roland Burris promised to \"personally do something\" for Blagojevich's campaign. During the conversation, Burris and Blagojevich discussed the possibility that Burris might raise campaign money on a larger scale, saying \"I know I could give him a check myself.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported a few days after the revelation: \"When asked in a recent interview with The Associated Press how the scandal back home has affected him, Burris made a sweeping gesture with his hands and literally brushed the matter aside.\"\n\nOn May 28, 2009, Democratic Illinois Rep.  and Republican Rep. , the ranking Republican on the impeachment panel who had questioned Burris during his January 8 testimony, claimed that Burris committed perjury and called for him to be removed from office. In 2009, Senator Burris was named one of the 15 Most Corrupt Members of Congress by the watchdog group .\n\nSangamon County State's Attorney John Schmidt announced on June 19, 2009, that Burris would not face criminal perjury charges, stating that Burris's promise to \"personally do something\" for Governor Blagojevich was too vague to rise to the level of criminality, as it could be interpreted in too many different ways. Burris praised the announcement, saying, \"The truth has prevailed\"; meanwhile, Durkin criticized Schmidt's decision, saying, \"They're all contradictions to his previously sworn statements. To me, it's a pretty strong case.\"\n\nThe  issued a letter on November 20, 2009, admonishing him saying that although no ethics charges would be pursued, \"The Committee found that you should have known that you were providing incorrect, inconsistent, misleading, or incomplete information to the public, the Senate and those conducting legitimate inquiries into your appointment to the Senate.\"\n\n\n in June 2009]]\nJust as Revels, Bruce, Brooke, Braun, and Obama had been the Senate's only African American member, Burris was the only black Senator during his term in office. Following his leaving office, it would be over two years until the next black Senator, , a Republican, and the first black senator elected in the south since Reconstruction, took office in January 2013.\n\n\n*'''''' \n**\n**\n**\n*'''''' \n**\n**\n**\n*'''''' \n\n\n\nAccording to  records, on January 2, 2009, prior to the controversy regarding his conflicting explanations of his fundraising activity on behalf of , Burris signed a statement of candidacy for the .

Huffington Post AOL News. June 1, 2011. Retrieved June 2, 2011. McCarter had noted that Jacobs' father was a registered lobbyist for the utility, but Jacobs' response was that \"one thing he would not allow to happen would be for anyone to question my integrity.\" Jacobs also said this information had been fully disclosed, his constituents were aware of it, \"and they would make a decision based on that\".

McCarter voted against the bill because he believed such programs would be used to promote homosexuality. While answering questions about his vote, McCarter said, \"Some of these programs are very good. They indeed encourage kids not to bully.

In 1963, Rush dropped out of high school before graduating and joined the . While stationed in Chicago in 1966, he joined the , which had helped obtain national civil rights legislation passed in 1964 and 1965. In 1968, he went  from the Army and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the . He later finished his Army service, receiving an honorable discharge.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Rush was involved in the  and worked in civil disobedience campaigns in the . After co-founding the Illinois chapter of the  in 1968, he served as its defense minister. After the Chicago Police Department and the State's Attorney Office assassinated Black Panther  in a police raid, Rush said, \"We needed to arm ourselves\", and called the police \"pigs\". Earlier that year, Rush had discussed the philosophy of his membership in the Black Panthers, saying, \"Black people have been on the defensive for all these years. The trend now is not to wait to be attacked. We advocate offensive violence against the power structure.\" After Hampton's death, Rush became acting chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party. He worked on several nonviolent projects that built support for the Black Panthers in African-American communities, such as coordinating a medical clinic which offered  testing on an unprecedented scale. Rush was imprisoned for six months in 1972 on a weapons charge after carrying a pistol into a police station. In 1974, he left the Black Panthers, who were already in decline. \"We started glorifying thuggery and drugs\", he told ''''.

Rush's allies in the black-power movement abandoned the Democrats in the wake of the political turmoil that followed the sudden death in 1987 of Chicago's first black mayor, , and formed their own political party, naming it after Washington. Rush infuriated  leaders by spurning their candidates for local offices and sometimes backing white Democrats instead. He worked with the Democrats and was rewarded with the deputy chairmanship of the state party.\n\n\n\nAfter redistricting in 1992, Rush ran in Illinois's newly redrawn 1st congressional district, which included much of Chicago's South Side.

The district has been in Democratic hands since 1935.\n\nIn the 2000 Democratic primary for the district, Rush was challenged by  . During the primary, Rush said, \"Barack Obama went to  and became an educated fool. Barack is a person who read about the civil rights protests and thinks he knows all about it.\"\n\nRush claimed Obama was insufficiently rooted in Chicago's black neighborhoods to represent constituents' concerns. Obama said Rush was a part of \"a politics that is rooted in the past\" and said he could build bridges with whites to get things done. But while Obama did well in his own  , he did not get enough support from the surrounding black neighborhoods. Starting with 10% name recognition, Obama eventually gained 30% of the vote, losing by more than 2 to 1 despite winning among white voters. Rush won 61% of the vote, and won the general election with 88% of the vote.\n\n\nIn , Rush ran for , but lost to incumbent , an ethnic  whose father had long controlled the city as mayor. He remained active in city and regional politics.\n\nIn 2013, Rush criticized U.S. Senator 's proposal that 18,000 members of the Chicago gang \"Gangster Disciples\" be arrested, calling Kirk's suggestion \"headline grabbing\" and an \"upper-middle-class, elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about\". A spokesman for Kirk said Kirk had dealt with the issues for decades.\n\nAlso in 2013, Alex Clifford was forced to resign as CEO of  commuter rail agency, but soon after he left, a memo was released indirectly accusing Rush of using his political power to steer a $50,000 contract to a Washington-based business group.\n\n\n\nIn the , Rush endorsed Mayor  in Emanuel's runoff reelection campaign against .\n\nIn the , Rush endorsed  in the first round and  in the runoff.\n\nThough a very close friend of former President  and his wife, , Rush announced early on in the  that he would support Obama. After Obama won the presidency and vacated his Senate seat, Rush said that an African American should be appointed to the seat: \"With the resignation of President-elect Obama, we now have no African-Americans in the , and we believe it will be a national disgrace to not have this seat filled by one of the many capable African-American Illinois politicians.\" Rush said he did not support any particular person and was not interested in the seat.

The , passed in 2000, incorporated Rush's Urban Asthma Reduction Act of 1999, amending the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant program and including an integrated approach to  management.\n\n;Energy\nRush was very outspoken against the GOP's No More Solyndras Bill, which would override a loan guarantee by the Energy Department to encourage research and development. The Energy Department provided a federal loan guarantee to the solar manufacturing company Solyndra to help with R&D. He said the No More Solyndras Bill would be better named the No More Innovation Bill.\n\n;Firearms\nRush introduced Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 on January 6, 2009. The bill would require all owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms to register for a federal firearms license. All sales of the subject firearms would have to go through a licensed dealer.

He spoke against . As the House forbids its members from wearing headgear as a breach of decorum, Rush was called out of order and escorted from the chamber.\n\n;Lynching\nRush twice introduced the  (named for Chicago teenager ) to make  a federal crime.  Federal anti-lynching legislation in Congress had been held up for about 100 years, but the Emmett Till Act finally became law in 2022.\n\n\nIn the  (January 3, 2017, to January 3, 2019):\n*\n**\n** (Chair)\n\n\nRush's career average missed vote percentage is 15.7, much higher than the median missed vote percentage of 2.2 for members of the House.

He had the distinction of missing more votes than any other member of the House between 2007 and 2015: of 6,906 votes, Rush missed 1,549 (22.4%).

The  questioned a Rush campaign-finance report that showed thousands of dollars spent on vague categories such as \"campaign visibility\" and \"services rendered.\" His campaign paid his wife, Carolyn, $50,000 in 2015 for consulting, and his brother, Marlon Rush of Lansing, $13,000 in 2016 for two months' work as campaign manager, according to FEC reports. Oxford Media Group Inc., an Oak Brook company owned by multimillionaire businessman Joseph Stroud, paid the  billwhich was well past due, totaling $17,900 for Rush's Beloved Community Christian Church in 2010. Rush had personally been named in a ComEd lawsuit over the church's previous unpaid bills. Stroud was trying to break into the wireless phone industry dominated by Verizon and AT&T, and Rush was pushing for federal tax incentives that would give one of Stroud's other companies a leg up as a minority-owned business. A nonprofit Rush started got $1 million from the charitable arm of what is now AT&T for what turned out to be a failed effort to create a \"technology center\" in Englewood. At the time, the telecom giant was seeking support for legislation in a House committee of which Rush was a key member.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2013, businesses counting on favorable actions by Rush in Congress donated roughly $1.7 million to his pet charities. Rush attracted more charitable corporate giving than any other Illinois congressman by a large margin, according to a Sunlight Foundation study of expenditures from 2009 to 2011. While it is impossible to assign cause and effect, at critical junctures Rush parted with fellow liberal Democrats in Congress to take pro-industry positions aligned with corporate benefactors SBC/AT&T, Comcast and ComEd.\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRush is pastor of the Beloved Community Christian Church in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood.

Unpaid taxes included property taxes, income taxes, and employee withholding taxes. New City Bank sued Rush and his wife for $500,000, claiming they failed to pay their property taxes in 2009. In 1994, Rush owed the IRS $55,000 in federal income taxes, according to Cook County records.\n\nSince 2018, 15% of Rush's congressional salary has been garnished to repay more than $1 million he owes on a delinquent loan for the now-closed church he founded in Chicago. Cook County Circuit Judge Alexander White ordered Rush to repay the $550,000 loan that New City Bank granted him and seven other co-signers in 2005. With the money, Rush bought the former Our Redeemer Lutheran Church in Englewood and restyled it as the Beloved Community Church of God in Christ.\n\n\n]]\nRush has been married three times. His first marriage, when he was 19, was to Sandra Milan. They had two children together and divorced in 1973. He was married to community organizer, precinct captain, and political strategist Carolyn Thomas from 1980 or 1981 until her death from  on March 13, 2017. Their  had seven surviving children at the time of her death. On June 30, 2018, Rush married minister and author Paulette Holloway.\n\nRush's son Huey Rich was murdered on the South Side of Chicago at age 29, in October 1999. He was named after Black Panther co-founder . Rich's mother was Saundra Rich, whom Rush never married. On October 18, 1999, Rich was approached outside his apartment building by Leo Foster and Darcell Prince, who falsely claimed to be police officers. They wore s, and carried s, guns, and badges, but Rich didn't believe them and ran. Foster and Prince chased and shot Rich, then stole several hundred dollars and keys from his pockets. He died in the hospital four days later from extensive blood loss. Foster told police that he and Prince were coming to collect $110,000 worth of cocaine that Rich had been paid to procure but hadn't delivered. Rich's friends didn't believe Foster's story, with some suggesting it may have been a case of mistaken identity. Rush said Rich \"was involved in positiveas far as I knowendeavors\", adding \"as parents, we don't always know\". Foster was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the murder and Prince to 50 years.

A  serving most of the , he represented such affluent constituencies as the  and  as well as such poor areas as  and . At the time of his death he was the Dean of the Chicago City Council, as well as the last alderman from the era of partisan aldermanic elections and when wards elected two aldermen each. An alderman for 43 years, and the last to have served under a Republican mayor, he is as of 2018 the third-longest serving alderman in Chicago history, behind  of the 14th ward and  of the 1st.\n\nA corrupt and mob-linked yet popular and effective alderman, Crowe kept his affiliation with the  in a changing climate and was able to maintain and entrench his power within the 42nd ward as the decades wore on. His long tenure witnessed many political changes in Chicago and his ward. When he assumed office, the Democratic Party of the area was bitterly fractured and his fellow aldermen were ; in the years since his death the Democratic Party has been the dominant force of the 42nd ward, which has yet to have a Republican alderman as of 2018.\n\n\n\nCrowe was born on August 21, 1891, in , to Kathryn Josephine (née Ryan) (1866–1941) and Stephen Augustus Crowe (1860–1925), who had been respectively born in Illinois and Iowa, both to parents born in Ireland. He was the eldest of five children and three sons. He was a nephew of notorious kidnapper , who abducted wealthy meatpacking heir  in 1900. The family moved to Illinois sometime between 1892 and 1897, and by 1900 he was living in the  district in what was then known as \"Smokey Hollow\" at what is now 400 North , across Kinzie Avenue from what was then  and would later become  in a hotel owned and operated by his father. By 1910 the family moved up north to 753 North Dearborn Avenue, in another hotel owned by the elder Crowe known as the Dearborn Hotel. Dorsey would still be living there as of 1917, at which point he was also operating a real-estate business, and would work in the same building one address to the north at 755 North Dearborn at the start of his aldermanic tenure.\n\nCrowe graduated from , and joined the Army Air Service in 1917. He received preliminary aviation schooling at  and more detailed training at  in San Antonio, reaching the rank of  in 1918.\n\n\nFor the entirety of his term of office Crowe was closely affiliated with the machine, and would gain a reputation as Boss of the 42nd ward.\n\nAlthough usually associated with the machine, Crowe occasionally deflected from the administration. In two meetings of the Council in 1939 he consistently voted against the machine, bringing his nominal voting percentage of agreeing with it down to 17 percent. (Excluding those meetings, he voted for the machine 50 percent of the time in 1939.) In addition to his work as alderman, Crowe was an Illinois delegate to the , as well as an alternate delegate to the  and  conventions.\n\n\nAs early as 1918 it has been claimed that Crowe first ran for alderman in 1915, but his name does not appear in the canvassing sheets that year for any of the primaries or the general election. He did run in 1916, winning the Democratic primary against John Prendergast but falling in the general election to Republican candidate Earl J. Walker, who was aided in part by society women who learned oratory for the purpose. Then, as in 1919, his family history was used against him, although the women also asserted that he had been floor manager for a hotel employees' ball that had turned into a drunken orgy. He would not run again in the Democratic primaries for either 1917 or 1918.\n\nCrowe ran again in 1919. At that time he was serving as an Army aviator and had been injured the previous autumn while distributing propaganda for war bonds when his plane crashed and he fell , in large part winning on a sympathy vote and defeating Republican incumbent Robert Hall McCormick (not to be confused with , who had been Republican alderman of the same ward from 1904 to 1906), who was further perceived to have a very poor attendance record at the Council,\n8,735 votes to 6,287.\n\nCrowe was condemned during his campaign by the reform-focused Municipal Voters' League, who noted his relation to Pat Crowe, stated that \"his place of residence and business, the Dearborn hotel, is operated by his father, and has been the scene of police raids,\" and did not mention Crowe's military service. Embittered by such attacks, he would after his victory proclaim that \"I never want to know any of the Municipal Voters' league people. I never want them to support me, and I think I shall make a record they could support if they were honest. They vilified my family so terribly that I wish never to have anything to do with them.\"\n\nAt the time Crowe declared zoning to be his main passion, planning to stop factories from coming up on  and giving his zealous support for the . He also proposed to electrify all of the railway terminals in the city to reduce smoke and noise, and supported giving jobs to veterans returning from France. He had his first regular session with the rest of the new council on April 28.\n\n\nIn his first year as alderman, Crowe was a member of the Judiciary, Streets and Alleys, and Building and City Hall committees of the Council. By 1920 he chaired the committee on Small Parks, Playgrounds, and Beaches. In 1921 he went on record to oppose a proposed , quipping that \"The proposed Sunday law is against all laws of common sense,\" a sentiment shared by many such fellow aldermen as 29th ward alderman and City Council Leader Thomas F. Byrne. In the aldermanic election that year the Municipal Voters' League would reverse its position on him, endorsing him as \"[having] courage and show[ing] capacity for further good council service\". On May 23, 1922, he was one of seven aldermen to call a special meeting of the Council to consider adding 1,000 patrolmen to the police force, which was ultimately approved. In 1920 aldermanic elections became nominally nonpartisan and Crowe's colleague and erstwhile rival Earl J. Walker was defeated in a runoff election by fellow Republican Charles J. Agnew.\n\nFrom its incorporation in 1837, the City of Chicago had always been divided into wards which elected two aldermen each and which had numbered 35 by 1923. Both of Crowe's colleagues of the 21st Ward had been Republicans. In 1923 the number of aldermen allotted to each ward was reduced to one. Along with this change the number of wards was increased from 35 to 50 and Crowe's ward was renumbered the 42nd ward, the 21st ward designation being thenceforth applied to the eastern part of  and western part of the  represented by former 29th ward alderman Dennis A. Horan. The new 50-member Council convened on April 16.\n\nDespite coming from a greatly anti-Prohibition area, in 1923 he voted against a resolution proposed by fellow Democratic alderman  of the 1st ward that New York Governor  be commended for signing a prohibition enforcement repeal act and that Illinois to do the same. He claimed that the vote was because he didn't have enough time to consider the resolution, although prominent wet and  President  insisted it was because Crowe wasn't allowed to introduce it, and criticized him and 43rd ward alderman  for voting against the resolution when their respective U.S. Representative  was leading the fight against the  in Congress.\n\nThroughout much of the 1920s, Republican , who had connections to notorious mobster , was the mayor of Chicago. Crowe was generally against Thompson; in 1923, he was supported by the Municipal Voters' League and several of the leading citizens of the area in the first election of the new one-alderman 42nd ward against his former colleague Charles J. Agnew, who was seen as a consistent supporter of Thompson. His opposition to Thompson notwithstanding, Crowe had his own connections to the mob. In 1920 he was one of many politicians present at mobster 's funeral. He was also one of many officials implicated in receiving mafia kickbacks in the aftermath of a hit made on mob accountant , his erstwhile law firm Crowe & Kolb having received and via a rubber stamp endorsed a check of $500}} on September 4, 1925. Crowe denied knowing Zuta or anything about the check.\n\nDespite such mob links, he endorsed, and his ward voted for, incumbent anti-mob and Prohibition-enforcing mayor  in the . In retaliation for such support, on April 4, the day before the election, his downtown office at the Burnham Building (currently known as the , not to be confused with the current ) was ransacked, allegedly by North Side Gang member , among others. Invading the office while Crowe was himself absent, the attackers kicked out a window, knocked over file cabinets, and either scared or assaulted his secretary, although contemporary accounts place the invasion having taken place at night after the attackers assaulted a watchman to get keys. Upon his arrest Drucci created a scuffle with the police and was killed in the resulting shootout.\n\nCrowe was not universally popular within the 42nd ward at this time. In particular, the reform-minded '''',  were located within the ward, and his old enemy the Municipal Voters' League, despite its 1921 and 1923 reviews, continued to endorse his opponents throughout the decade. He was not particularly popular in the areas east of , comprising the Republican-dominated Gold Coast and Streeterville. The importance of this opposition varied throughout the decade. In , he crushed League-endorsed candidate Philip Farina 8,549 votes to 814. In , however, he received 144 fewer votes than wealthy stockbroker and -backed reform Republican candidate Richard Prendergast (of unknown relation to John Prendergast from 1916) and was forced into a runoff, where he nonetheless defeated Prendergast with a comfortable 1,622-vote majority. The campaign was active and violent, involving such violence as fistfights and shootings, and Crowe's precinct captain Charles S. Brown would be found dead in September.\n\nOn June 2, 1929, Crowe was involved in an automobile accident in  in which his vehicle was crowded into a ditch and he was thrown through the roof of the car and pinned in the wreckage before being saved by a passerby as it began to catch fire, suffering a concussion and being rendered unconscious for six hours. The injuries forced him to miss most Council business for the remainder of 1929.\n\n\nThe onset of the  initially spelled problems for Crowe, with seven rivals vying for his seat in , at least two of whom – hoteliers Thomas Daniel Collins and Charles F. Henry – receiving significant support. However, even the Municipal Voters' League endorsed him, if weakly, over the inexperienced Henry. He would ultimately defeat all of his rivals in the first round with a 3,871-vote majority.\n\nIn 1939 the Municipal Voters' League disbanded and merged with the Citizens' Association of Chicago. By 1945 Crowe was the second-longest serving member of the Council (behind only future congressman  of the 25th ward, who had been serving since 1906), as well as the alderman with the longest continuous term of service (Bowler had been out of office between 1923 and 1927 and between 1934 and 1935), and was reported to be \"one of the most popular men in the council\".\n\n\nCrowe continued to have dubious connections and engage in dubious practices throughout his tenure. As of 1947 he owned the Olympic Hotel operated by Harry Rubenstein, who was definitively linked to killing a man and suspected of killing two more. When accused of beating out two independent candidates in 1959 by paying each voter 50 cents, he is reported to have retorted \"Madame, you can't get that done for 50 cents. It costs $5.\"\n\nBy 1960, the composition of the 42nd ward was changing, with an influx of recent immigrants from Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, and a third of the voters being African-American. Regardless (if not because) of these demographic changes, Crowe's hold on the ward stayed as strong as it ever had been. The former Republican strongholds of the Gold Coast had become at least half Democratic as former mansions were turned into apartment buildings. Republicans at that point were \"not considered of much importance in the general scheme of things\". At this time Crowe was usually elected without the need of a runoff election. His good friend and longtime ward  William J. Connors was known as \"Old Reliable\" due to his obedience to the wishes of the machine. Crowe himself was the president ''pro tempore'' of the Chicago City Council, a position he would hold until his death.\n\n\n\nHaving served in the Air Service, Crowe was interested in several projects concerning aviation. In 1924 he and Mayor Dever suggested to the Council that appropriations should be made to investigate various sites for an air field in Chicago. In 1928 as an alternative to the delayed project of a Downtown airport that would eventually become  he proposed an airstrip on the site of then disused , which would continue into 1929. Neither of these proposals are known to have produced any results. He did, however, speak at the opening of what would later become  on May 8, 1926.\n\nIn 1921, as a member of the Aviation committee, Crowe insisted that a provision be added to a proposed Aviation bylaw prohibiting  using flammable gas from being flown over the city, action on which was deferred.\n\n\nIn 1939 the  over the Chicago River was removed so that the  could be constructed. Crowe complained that such removal, and other associated damage wrought by the subway construction, was ruining business on the thoroughfare. He also noted that a widening of the Street which had been planned in 1931 had not been followed through, which he also blamed on funding issues caused by the construction of the subway. Expressing disdain for a watered-down version of widening involving only sidewalk removal and not affecting the property lines and a fear that unsold bonds for the widening project would be used to pay damages incurred during construction of the viaduct, he suggested that the money be used to continue on with the street widening. This was a popular sentiment in the area; in February 1940, local property owner Donald M. Campbell, backed by the property-owners' North Central association, sued the City to enjoin it from pursuing the sidewalk-reduction plan and pursue the original 1931 scheme.\n\n\nCrowe was a Catholic by faith, and his ward covered the , the primate Catholic church of the Chicago archdiocese. He moved to the Gold Coast sometime in the 1920s, living by 1929 at 65 East Bellevue Place with his mother, brothers Stephen A. and Orpheus E., aunt Frances C. Ryan, a servant, and a lodger. He would still be living there as of 1959. His aunt, who had lived with the family for all of his life and who had been involved in his real estate business in later years, died in 1931. In 1951 a safe weighing several hundred pounds and containing no cash but miscellaneous insurance policies, warranty deeds, and a $1,000  made out to the Chicago Title and Trust company for use in a realty transaction, was stolen from his real-estate office.\n\nHe married attorney Mary G. Kelly in 1939 at Holy Name, with brother Stephen A. as the best man. He died of a heart attack on July 1, 1962, at Veterans Research Hospital. He had previously had a heart attack in 1953, and was taken to Chicago Wesley Memorial Hospital in critical condition in May 1961 after suffering another one. He was survived by widow Mary. Services were held the following Thursday on the 5th at Holy Name, where it was requested that flowers be omitted, and he was buried in the Catholic . Mayor  referred to him as \"a great figure in the political life and the civic life of Chicago\", while 31st ward alderman and Council floor leader Thomas E. Keane deemed him \"[a man with] the courage to make a decision\" and \"[one who] helped shape the destiny of our city.\"  was closed except for emergency services on the 4th through 1 p.m. on the 5th in his memory. Upon his death,  of the neighboring 43rd ward, who had served from 1933 to 1943 and again since 1947, became the alderman with the longest service. Nevertheless, the Council elected 37th ward alderman Paul T. Corcoran on August 31 to succeed Crowe as President ''pro tempore'', while the office of 42nd ward alderman would remain vacant until future Circuit Court judge Mayer Goldberg assumed it on February 26, 1963.\n\n\nCrowe first ran for alderman in 1916, winning the Democratic primary but losing the general election.\n\n\nIn 1929 he lost the first round of the election to Republican Richard Prendergast. However, in the resulting runoff he would handily defeat Prendergast. This was one of the last elections in which he was seriously contested.\n\n|candidate1 = Richard Prendergast\n|party1 = Republican Party (United States)\n|votes1 = 3,399\n|percent1 = 36.29\n|candidate2 = Dorsey R.

She is the second , after , to hold this position.\n\n\nFoxx was born in Chicago and grew up in the  Housing Project on the  . Raised by her mother and grandmother, Foxx graduated from LaSalle Language Academy in  and from  in 1990. She earned a bachelor's degree in  from , and a J.D. degree from . She is a member of the board of trustees of .\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Foxx worked as an assistant public guardian in the Cook County Public Guardian's Office for three years. She then worked as Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County for 12 years, joining during 's tenure as State's Attorney. In this role, she worked on cases of child protection and juvenile offenders. In 2013, she was hired as deputy  for  President , focusing on  issues. She was later promoted to chief of staff for Preckwinkle, and served in that role until 2016. Foxx has been described as a  of Preckwinkle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2015, Foxx announced that she would challenge incumbent  in the 2016 election for Cook County State's Attorney. She also faced a second challenger, former federal and state prosecutor Donna More. Foxx campaigned on a platform of , emphasizing policies such as diverting low-level offenders to treatment programs rather than prisons, address wrongful convictions, and dealing more aggressively with police misconduct.\n\nDuring the campaign, Alvarez came under scrutiny for her handling of the  by Chicago police officers. Foxx criticized Alvarez for her performance on the issues of police accountability and wrongful convictions.\n\nOn January 14, 2016, the Cook County Democratic Party endorsed Foxx for state's attorney, reversing its decision made in August 2015 to not endorse any candidate. She won the Democratic primary for state's attorney's race on March 15, 2016, with 58% of the vote, and went on to win the November general election with 72% of the vote.\n\n\n\nFoxx announced on November 19, 2019, that she would run for re-election. She faced three competitors in the Democratic Party primary: Bill Conway, , and Donna More. Ahead of the primary, Foxx had been endorsed by several progressive organizations, labor unions, and state-wide elected officials. Her campaign's largest donors were Michael Sacks, , , , and ; a  supporting her campaign also received a $2 million donation from . She won the primary election on March 17, 2020, with 50.19% of the vote. Relative to the 2016 election, she maintained a high level of support in the county's majority-African American neighborhoods and lost some support in white neighborhoods (especially in Chicago's northwest side and in suburban Cook County). In the November 3, 2020 general election, she defeated Republican candidate Pat O'Brien with 54.1% of the vote and was re-elected to a four-year term.\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, shortly after taking office, Foxx announced that the State's Attorney's office would no longer pursue keeping certain detainees in jail because they are unable to post the  amount of $1000. Foxx expressed support for the proposed Bail Reform Act, testifying in favor of it at the Illinois General Assembly despite opposition to the bill from the Illinois State's Attorneys' Association. The legislation passed in June 2017 and removed the requirement to post cash bail for those charged with minor crimes. That same month, Foxx's office announced that prosecutors would no longer request  for those charged with low-level nonviolent offenses in court.\n\n\nIn March 2018, Foxx's office launched an  portal and released 6 years of data on felony criminal cases. Since then, case-level data on felony intake, initiation, disposition, and sentencing, along with summary reports and dashboards, have been posted on the State's Attorney office's website.\n\n\nA series of reports by The People's Lobby and Reclaim Chicago, progressive organizations who had endorsed Foxx in 2016, found that the number of sentences involving prison time in Cook County dropped 2.5% from 2016 to 2017 and 19% from 2017 to 2018.\n\nAn October 2019 report by  found that since taking office, Foxx \"turned away more than 5,000 cases that would have been pursued by previous State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, mostly by declining to prosecute low-level shoplifting and drug offenses and by diverting more cases to alternative treatment programs.\" Foxx has directed her office to not prosecute shoplifting cases under $1,000 as felonies.\n\n\nEarly in her first term, Foxx established a program called the Gun Crimes Strategies Unit (GCSU), which placed specially trained prosecutors directly in police districts. In 2019, analysis by the  found that charges for habitual gun offenders increased in the five districts with the GCSU program.\n\n\nIn April 2017, Foxx announced that her office had drafted legislation proposing an amendment to the Special Prosecutor Act, which would give the statewide Office of the State Appellate Prosecutor the jurisdiction to review cases of police shootings where the State's Attorney's office decides not to prosecute. The legislation was passed in May 2017 and signed into law in August 2017.\n\n\nIn January 2019, Foxx announced her support for the proposed , and helped to write the provisions of the law pertaining to past convictions. The law passed in May 2019, and later that year, Foxx's office initiated the expungement of 1,012 low-level nonviolent marijuana convictions as allowed by the new law. Foxx's office stated that it would attempt to use the maximum authority allowed by the law to overturn low-level convictions, and partnered with the nonprofit organization  to develop procedures for the conviction relief process. Foxx has called conviction relief an effort to \"right the wrongs of the past\" and \"a recommitment of our values; that a low-level marijuana conviction does not mean that someone is a threat to public safety.\" By 2022, the effort had led to the expungement of 15,000 marijuana convictions.\n\n\nIn October 2019, as part of her budget proposal to the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Foxx proposed expanding the Conviction Integrity Unit in the State's Attorney's office by adding 10 new units. The proposed expansion was partly in response to developments that would enable the State's Attorney's office to address conviction challenges based on allegations of torture by former Chicago police commander .\n\nAs of February 2020, the Conviction Integrity Unit has worked with the Exoneration Project to overturn 95 convictions tied to the team of disgraced former Chicago police sergeant Ronald Watts.\n\n\nIn 2020, during the , Foxx issued a department-wide policy to decriminalize protesting, instructing prosecutors to distinguish peaceful protestors from \"individuals who intentionally cause harm or damage.\" The policy adopted a \"presumption of dismissal\" for certain low-level charges (e.g. disorderly conduct, public demonstration, unlawful gathering, curfew violation) and a \"presumption against proceeding unless body-worn camera footage is available and/or where a police officer is the complainant\" for more serious charges (e.g. resisting or obstructing arrest, assault, battery, aggravated battery, mob action, obstructing identification) that arose during protests. Foxx's challenger in the , Republican candidate Pat O'Brien, criticized this policy and argued that it allowed \"crime and looting to intermix with peaceful protests.\"\n\n\nOn February 19, 2019, Foxx announced that she had  herself from the  hate crime investigation. Smollett orchestrated a staged assault and filed a false report with the local police; Foxx's recusal, due to her \"familiarity with potential witnesses in the case\", prompted criticism from her predecessor . Recusing herself would have required Foxx to ask the court to appoint an outside attorney as a . Critics called her method of recusal insufficient, saying that because her office retained authority over the case, she maintained influence over how it was handled.\n\nOn March 26, 2019, her office dropped all charges against Smollett, which was denounced by Mayor  and Police Superintendent . The Chicago Police Union pushed for an investigation into Foxx's decision. Foxx was also criticized by the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association and the National District Attorneys Association. Chicago's  called for her resignation. Smollett was convicted in December 2021 and was sentenced in March 2022 to 150 days in county jail.\n\n\nIn April 2023, after two car thieves, age 14 and 17, drove recklessly and killed Cristian Uvidia, a 6-month-old child who was in another vehicle, ABC News Chicago said, \"The two have been charged with just one misdemeanor count of criminal trespassing each.\"\n\n\nKim Foxx has been married to Kelley Foxx since 2001.

In 2012, Biss was elected to the  Illinois Senate, and represented its 9th district from 2013 through 2019. Biss unsuccessfully ran as a candidate in the Democratic primary for  in the . In 2021, he won the election for mayor of Evanston in the city's consolidated primary.\n\n\nBiss was born into a Jewish  family of musicians.

Mathematician Nikolai Mnëv published a report in 2007 that there was a \"serious flaw\" in two of Biss's works published in '''' and '''' in 2003, saying \"unfortunately this simple mistake destroys the main theorems of both papers\". In 2008 and 2009, Biss acknowledged the flaw and published  reports for the two papers, thanking Mnëv for drawing his attention to the error. He and a co-author, , also acknowledged in 2009 that there was a \"fatal error\" in a paper they had published in '''' in 2006, thanking mathematicians Masatoshi Sato and Tom Church for helping to explain the problem. Another of his papers published in '''' was formally retracted by the publisher in 2017, fifteen years after its 2002 publication, with the journal saying \"This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief after receiving a complaint about anomalies in this paper. The editors solicited further independent reviews which indicated that the definitions in the paper are ambiguous and most results are false. The author was contacted and does not dispute these findings.\" The journal said they had identified twelve specific errors in the paper, but clarified that they had concluded that the paper's findings were merely inaccurate, not fraudulent. When contacted by the journal, Biss had responded saying \"Thank you for writing. I am no longer in mathematics and so don't feel equipped to fully evaluate these claims. I certainly do not dispute them. If you would like to publish a retraction to that effect, that would seem to me to be an appropriate approach.\"\n\nWhen the 2017 retraction and the previously identified errors were reported by the '''' in September 2017, his campaign blamed operatives for the perceived front-runner for the  candidate for governor of Illinois, , for raising it as a political issue. They said \"Whether it was training at MIT or the University of Chicago, Daniel has had dozens of academic papers reviewed by his peers and published. In a few cases, further research has found that the case posited in the original article didn't stand up, and he revised his findings.\" They referred to the raising of the issue as \"silly opposition research\".\n\n\nBiss ran for a seat in the Illinois State House of Representatives in 2008, losing to   in the 17th district.

In May 2015, the Illinois Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional. In rejecting the constitutionality of SB&nbsp;1, the Illinois Supreme Court stated: \"These modifications to pension benefits unquestionably diminish the value of the retirement annuities the members…were promised when they joined the pension system. Accordingly, based on the plain language of the Act, these annuity-reducing provisions contravene the pension protection clause's absolute prohibition against diminishment of pension benefits and exceed the General Assembly's authority,\" the ruling states. Biss later said that his work on SB&nbsp;1 was an error, saying, \"I decided this was the least bad of the bad options. I allowed myself to think we couldn't do better.\" Biss later expressed support for funding higher pension payments if necessary by instituting a tax system with a graduated income tax and a tax on financial transactions.\n\nIn March 2017, Biss sponsored SB&nbsp;1424, a bill proposing a system of matching state funds for small-donor political contributions and SB&nbsp;780, a bill proposing to elect a number of statewide offices by .

In 1988, Reynolds finished third with only 14% of the vote with multiple candidates running.  In 1990, Reynolds lost, but ran much closer after Savage's conduct was criticized by the  in connection with a sex scandal.\n\nIn 1992, redistricting pushed the 2nd further into Chicago's suburbs. The  reported that this change was \"seen as a benefit to the 40-year-old Mr. Reynolds, whose appeals for accountability and racial unity sit well with middle-class black moderates embarrassed by Mr. Savage and whites frightened by his often combative, racially charged speech.\"  Shortly before the primary, Reynolds was lightly injured when unknown gunmen fired shotguns at his vehicle while he was waiting at an intersection. \nHe was given police protection for the rest of the campaign; Savage's supporters accused Reynolds of staging the incident to generate sympathy for himself and suspicion of Savage.  Reynolds did not directly accuse Savage of organizing the attack.\n\nDays later, Reynolds beat Savage in the Democratic primary on March 17, and easily won the general election in November.  In Congress, he was granted a seat on the , the first freshman to serve on this committee in 14 years.  He voted for the  and introduced legislation on gun control.\n\n\nIn August 1994, Reynolds was  for  and criminal  for engaging in a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer that began during the 1992 campaign. He also faced charges of child pornography for asking the underage campaign worker to obtain \"lewd photographs of another girl who was age 15\" and obstruction of justice for convincing one of the girls involved to lie to authorities. Despite the charges, he continued his campaign and was re-elected in November without opposition. Reynolds initially denied the charges, which he claimed were racially motivated. \n\nOn August 22, 1995, Reynolds was convicted on 12 counts of criminal sexual assault, sexual abuse, obstruction of justice, and solicitation of . He resigned his seat on October 1 of that year. Had he attempted to stay in office, his role in Congress would have been very limited, as longstanding House rules state that a member convicted of a felony should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the  reviews the matter. Reynolds was sentenced to five years in federal prison and was expected to be released in 1998.\n\n\nIn April 1997, Reynolds was convicted on 16 new counts of bank , misusing campaign funds for personal use, and lying to  investigators. Specifically, one count of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud, eight counts of making false statements on loan applications, one count of conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission, and four counts of making false statements to the FEC. \n\nThese charges resulted in an additional sentence of 78 months in federal prison, to run consecutively with his 1995 sentence.

Reynolds sought the seat again, running in the 2013 special election to replace Jackson after Jackson retired.

He was allegedly found to be in possession of pornographic videos he had filmed with several women at the hotel where he was staying. Possession of  is a crime in the country. He had also purportedly accrued over $24,000 in hotel charges that he had yet to pay. The pornography charges were later dropped, but he pleaded guilty to violating immigration laws, and was deported to .  He claimed in early March 2014 to be hiding there from Zimbabwean s, who he claimed were targeting him because he possessed information about American companies from Chicago doing business illegally in Zimbabwe.\n\nOn June 26, 2015, Reynolds was indicted by a grand jury for failure to file federal income tax returns for the 2009 through 2012 tax years on more than $400,000 income. The next month he missed his arraignment, because he claimed he could not return to the U.S. due to issues with his daughter's health. It was not clear where Reynolds was, although he had previously hidden in South Africa out of fear for his life. \n\nIn April 2016, Reynolds was sentenced to two months of prison for two bond violations in his tax case and his trial was scheduled for September; Reynolds decided to represent himself in court. Reynolds claims the majority of the income the government claimed should be filed on income tax returns was given by Elzie Higginbottom, the key witness for the trial on misdemeanor tax charges, to him in order to travel to South Africa to set up opportunities in real estate and the diamond industry. \n\nOn September 28, 2017, Judge  found Reynolds guilty on tax charges, on all four counts alleging he failed to file a federal income tax return for four consecutive years. He was sentenced by Gettleman to six months in prison on May 10, 2018, which he began serving at the  in Chicago on August 1. At a press conference after the sentencing, Reynolds stated he planned to move to South Africa with his daughter after his release.  \n\nReleased into a halfway house in November 2018, Reynolds filed a lawsuit against deposed Zimbabwean dictator  and a Chicago-area businessman for what he said was \"physical and psychological torture\" that took place during his 2014 detainment in Zimbabwe.  Reynolds received permission from the U.S. court to travel to Africa while on supervised release.

She represented the 29th district for one term, from 1981 until 1983.\n\n\n\nStewart was born in  on September 3, 1952, and attended , graduating from  in 1970.

She won 23 out of 28 majority-Black precincts in the 66-precinct ward.\n\nShe was elected to the  in the 1980 election, as one of three representatives from the 29th district on Chicago's South Side. Stewart ran as an independent Democrat, and in the primary election she bested the other candidates by a wide margin. She also received the most votes of any candidate in the five-way general election race, which the '''' described as \"hotly contested\". She received the greatest number of votes of any candidate, 76,600 as against 64,700 for regular Democrat . She was, at the time, the youngest African American woman who had ever served in the Illinois state legislature.\n\nIn the , where Democrats were in the minority, she served on the Executive Committee and the Public Utilities Committee. She also served on the Rape Study Commission and cosponsored legislation to increase the penalties for . The General Assembly faced a difficult task of redistricting, as the voters of Illinois had passed the  in the same election that brought Stewart to the House. This amendment required the elimination of multi-member districts and a 1/3 reduction in the total number of representatives. Stewart broke from the Democratic Party to support the Republican redistricting map because it would maintain seven majority-Black State Senate districts and fourteen majority-Black State House districts. She urged that \"it is important that black people use the two party system and not be used by one party\".\n\nIn 1982, Stewart challenged Democratic incumbent  in . She came in third of four candidates in the primary, finishing behind incumbent Savage and CTA Chair Eugene Barnes. After her primary loss, Stewart chose to run for reelection in 1982 as an independent against fellow incumbent Democrat  Due to the redistricting following the , her district was now the 36th. She lost the general election.\n\nStewart remained involved in politics, serving as a field coordinator for 's successful 1983 mayoral campaign. In a 1986 special election for the , Stewart ran against Robert Kellam, the same white incumbent she had faced in 1977, in an eight-candidate race in Chicago's 18th ward. She was endorsed by the '''' and by Mayor . Stewart, viewed as the most viable African-American opponent to Kellam, ultimately lost the election receiving 4,720 (24%) to Kellum's 12,666 votes (64%). In the 1990 Democratic primary, she challenged incumbent  for the 31st House District seat, losing in a four-way race.\n\nShe served as an observer with the  for the . After the election, she decided to move to South Africa and opened a restaurant in .

She was elected to her first term as president of the , the executive branch of Cook County government, , becoming the first woman elected to that position.\n\nPreckwinkle previously served as a five-term  in the , representing 's  centered in . During her tenure, she emerged as the council's prominent defender of . She was also the runner-up in the  for .\n\nAmong other issues, she is known for championing the county's controversial sweetened beverage tax, sponsorship of living wage ordinances, concerns about the costs and benefits of , and her strong stance against  and excessive force.\n\n\nToni Lynn Reed was born in , and attended local schools there. She graduated from Washington High School in St. Paul in 1965. During high school, she worked on the campaign of , who was the first African American person to run for . She moved to Chicago to study at the  in the  , where she earned her  in 1969, and later a  in 1977.\n\nAfter college, Preckwinkle taught history for ten years in several high schools in the , including , the Visitation School, and Aquinas.\n\nIn 1985 and 1986, Preckwinkle served as President of the Disabled Adult Residential Enterprises (DARE). She was active in community organizations, serving as a member of the board of directors of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, and  Director of the Near South Chapter of the .\n\nDuring and after her 1987 aldermanic election campaign, she worked as a planner for the Chicago Department of Economic Development. By 1990, she was working as executive director of the Chicago Jobs Council and become allied with civil rights attorney .\n\n\nChicago's fourth ward is on the , adjacent to the  lakefront. It includes all of the  and  , and portions of , , ,  and the  community areas. The northern part of the ward (North of 45th Street) is predominantly African American, while the more racially diverse southern half is predominantly .\n\nIn her first two aldermanic campaigns for the 4th ward, in 1983 and 1987, Preckwinkle lost to the incumbent, , who had been in office since 1973. Evans was  's City Council floor leader and lieutenant. In 1983, Preckwinkle, supported by many independent voters, received enough support in the preliminary election to force a  (Chicago Aldermen are elected without regard to  affiliation, but must earn a majority of votes or the top two candidates have a runoff election). In the runoff, Preckwinkle carried traditionally \"independent\" precincts in Hyde-Park, but Evans carried the precincts in the north of the Ward.\n\nIn the 1987 elections, Evans defeated Preckwinkle by a 77% to 21% margin. In 1987, although both the '''' and '''' endorsed Evans, they praised Preckwinkle for qualities including her intelligence and independence, and expressed hopes she would continue in politics. Preckwinkle was endorsed by then   and also by the . Mayor Harold Washington endorsed Evans.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1991, Preckwinkle and four others challenged Evans for the 4th ward alderman's position. In the first round of voting on February 26, 1991, she won nearly one-third  in the ward by winning 20 of 58 precincts (all in the Hyde Park-Kenwood community). Evans and Preckwinkle again advanced to a runoff election, as they had in 1983. This time the majority of the eliminated candidates endorsed Preckwinkle. On April 2, 1991, Preckwinkle performed better in the northern part of the ward and was elected by a 109-vote margin, defeating the 17-year incumbent alderman Evans.\n\n\nPreckwinkle was initially sworn into office in 1991, and was reelected to four-year terms in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007.\n\nIn City Council, Preckwinkle developed a reputation for . She was known as being independent of then-Mayor , with whom she dissented more often than did any other alderman. In addition, Preckwinkle was one of the few aldermen on the City Council occasionally critical of the policies of former  .\n\nIn 2004, she and  were the only aldermen to vote against the mayor's city budget, and in 2005, Preckwinkle was the lone dissenter on the mayor's budget. Preckwinkle has supported the majority of legislation advanced by the mayor and his allies, including most of Daley's annual budget proposals; his controversial use of , an economic development program in which tax revenues are funneled into accounts controlled almost exclusively by the mayor; and, ultimately, his quest to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nPreckwinkle championed set-asides for  as her signature issue. The municipal ordinances she sponsored in 1993 and 1999 for affordable housing increased city expenditures on low and moderate income housing by 50 percent. In 2007, she pushed for increases in the existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance. This mandates that housing developers using land bought at a discount from the city, must reserve at least 10 percent of their housing units as \"affordable\", or to contribute money to an affordable-housing fund that would be equivalent to increasing the percentage to 15 percent. Affordable housing is considered a key element in the debate about ending  in Chicago.\n\nPreckwinkle's depth of knowledge of public housing has been recognised in the national press, which cited her defense of the maligned  when the federal government took over Chicago's  projects.\n\n\nPreckwinkle was outspoken in support of the city settling the  police torture case, rather than continuing to spend money in the litigation process. She was also proactive in the effort to pursue compensation for victims of police brutality in the related Burge cases, and sought hearings on the initial 's report. She has been a critic of the decades-long delay in settling the case, and supported the settlement.\n\nIn 2007, Preckwinkle pursued disclosure of  officers who were accused of using . The  had ruled that the records be unsealed and made available to the public. However, on July 13, 2007, the city filed an emergency motion to stay the judge's order. When the city argued in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals against disclosure, it said that aldermen would have access to the information. But Preckwinkle's August 23, 2007, request for the data was denied.\n\n\nPreckwinkle was a co-sponsor of the  ordinances that passed the city council in 1998 and 2002. On July 26, 2006, Preckwinkle was one of 35 aldermen who voted to approve the  sponsored by  (49th). For 7 weeks, until the law was overturned, Chicago was the largest United States city to require  to pay a \"living wage.\"\n\n 2006  parade (left to right starting at center in light green): Preckwinkle as the ,   as , and    as ]]\n\n\nIn October 2007, Preckwinkle opposed naming a landmark in the 4th ward for , the 1976  laureate, reportedly because Bellow had made remarks that Preckwinkle considered racist. She also opposed the renaming of a stretch of street near the original  as \" Way.\"\n\nIn 2006, Preckwinkle decided to paint over two 36-year-old, neglected and severely damaged public murals in the 47th Street  underpass. The murals had been created by  artists, working with permission from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, and had represented themes that included , African, , Indian, and   practices. The walls were later covered with murals that were newly commissioned by the city: one is made up of a series of ceramic tiles and the other is a traditional painted mural, featuring the city and important historical  figures, including former Alderman .\n\n\n\n\nThe  would have placed the main site of the 1.1&nbsp;billion residential complex in the 4th Ward, to accommodate athletes in an . Chicago was not chosen. Preckwinkle expressed her reservations about the initial plan, and was involved in plan revisions.\n\nSince the construction was planned almost entirely in her ward, she expressed concern that her constituents had not been offered a chance to voice their concerns with the plan. She was an early advocate of moving what would have been the Olympic Village from the McCormick Place truck yard to the Michael Reese Hospital site.\n\nShe also had concerns about how the proposed project would be financed. On March 14, 2007, Preckwinkle joined four other South Side aldermen in voting against a $500&nbsp;million public-funded guarantee to back up Chicago's Olympics bid. But on September 9, 2009, Preckwinkle voted to authorize Mayor Richard Daley to sign the International Olympic Committee's host city contract, which included financial guarantees putting full responsibility for the Olympics and its proposed $4.8&nbsp;billion operating budget on taxpayers.\n\n\nSince December 2010, Preckwinkle has served as  of the . Her tenure as president has seen her wield a great amount of top-down control on what has been a rather unified legislative body. This is in contrast to the discord that the Board saw in its four years under her immediate predecessor, . John Byrne and Alice Yin of the ''Chicago Tribune'' have characterized Preckwinkle as pursuing and implementing a \"progressive agenda\" as Board president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreckwinkle announced in January 2009, that she would run for president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. She launched her campaign website on June 18, 2009. On February 2, 2010, she won a strong victory the Democratic Party , defeating the incumbent Board President Todd Stroger and fellow challengers  (the ) and Terrence J. O'Brien. Preckwinkle received 48.99% in the primary despite their being a four-way race. as well as Green Party nominee Thomas Dresser. Preckwinkle received 69.54% of the vote in the general election.  Preckwinkle faced Republican nominee  in the November .\n\nThe four years prior to the 2010 election had seen the county government endure some of the greatest tumult that it had experienced in decades. As a candidate, Preckwinkle pledged that she would reform the Cook County government stability and repair the county's finances.\n\nWinning the general election, Preckwinkle became the first woman elected as president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. She won over two-thirds of the vote. After her Republican opponent received 26% of the vote, he moved out of the state.\n\n\nResigning as alderman in order to take the office of County Board president, Preckwinkle recommended that   appoint  to succeed her as fourth ward alderman, but Burns preferred to run in an open primary. Mayor Daley appointed Shirley Newsome as a \"caretaker\" alderman on January 12, 2011. Preckwinkle had urged this appointment. Burns handily won the election for the seat a month later.\n\nAfter taking office as the chief executive of the United States' second-most-populous county, Preckwinkle made newly-elected Cook County Commissioner  her  on the county board.\n\nAt the time she first took office, Cook County had the largest  population of any county in the United States. The county was also considered to have a high level of  in its government.\n\nIn her first term, Preckwinkle saw all of the initiatives she achieve passage by the county board, with the Board effectively resembling a \"rubber stamp\" to Preckwinkle. This was in major contrast to the preceding tenure of Todd Stroger, under whom the council saw intense infighting. On the few matters where Preckwinkle did not prevail on matters, the motivating factor for dispute was typically based upon political feuds between members of the Board rather than policy disagreements with Preckwinkle's position. Very few votes were divided. However, on the votes that did see division, the most frequent opposition to Preckwinkle's position arose from three Democratic members that had been allies of Todd Stroger: , , and  (prior to his November 2012 departure from the Board). These three were more frequent opponents to Preckwinkle's positions than the four Republican members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners were.\n\nFiscal issues that Preckwinkle inherited included an overgrown county payroll and a county government pension crisis. Preckwinkle's first three budgets each passed with no more than a single opposing vote.   Preckwinkle championed a 1% decrease to the county's  that was passed by the county board. Cook County had had what was, at the time, the highest sales tax rate of any county in the United States.\n\nOn September 7, 2011, the county board voted (aligned with Preckwinkle's position) to pass an ordinance that would have the county disregard a request by the federal government that the county jails detain suspects for an additional two days if there were questions about their immigration status in order to allow time to verify their immigration status. Preckwinkle's position had been that she would be unwilling to heed this request unless the federal government would reimburse the county for the expenses it incurred from such extended detentions, and the federal government had refused to compensate the county. Preckwinkle faced criticism for proclaiming that the ordinance to ignore the federal governments' request would actually enhance public safety. Four Republican members of the 's  wrote a letter to , the , decrying the county ordinance as a \"serious threat to public safety\". This generated national news coverage of the ordinance.\n\nIn August 2012, Dr. Nancy Jones, former head of the Cook County Morgue, referred to Preckwinkle as \"evil\" in criticizing her handling of the management and budgeting of the Morgue. Jones alleged that bodies had piled up and conditions were filthy. Also in August 2012, Preckwinkle defended Chicago's action to decriminalize possession of small amounts of  by allowing police to write tickets. She asserted that drug laws had unfairly resulted in more minorities being incarcerated for minor offenses.\n\n\n at the 2015 ]]\n\nPreckwinkle was reelected , going unchallenged on the ballot in both the Democratic primary and the general election. This lack of any challenger was unusual. Her two immediate elected predecessors,  and Todd Stroger, had usually faced primary election opponents during their reelection campaigns.\n\nDuring her second term, Preckwinkle saw nearly all of the legislation she supported get passed by the county board. By January 2018, Preckwinkle had only seen two votes by the board go against a position she and her floor leader, Chuy García, had supported, with these two votes being a resolution about \"\" procedures by the  and the repeal of the county's \"soda tax\". Very few votes by the County Board saw any division among its commissioners. The matters that tended to see the most divided votes were regarding budgeting and taxes. By January 2018, the board had seen any dissent on only 140 votes. This lack of divided votes came despite the fact that the board had four Republican members during this term, including  Chairman  and  Chair . However, the frequency of divided votes was still greater than it had been Preckwinkle's previous term. The 70 divided votes seen in the first year of Preckwinkle's second term alone eclipsed the mere 70 which had occurred in the first three years of her previous term.\n\nIn Preckwinkle's second term, the county reached a number of benchmarks she had set as goals. This included seeing a decrease in residents' cost of healthcare, coinciding with an increase in enrollment in health coverage provided through the  (ACA) which increased state and federal healthcare funding to the county. Preckwinkle had placed great effort in increasing the county's enrollment in the ACA. This also included a 3,800 person decrease in the daily inmate population in the county's s by the start of 2018 as well as a decrease to the per-inmate cost of operating the prisons. It also included an 11% decrease of county government debt by the start of 2018. The county government had decreased its spending while increasing the taxes it imposed.\n\nDespite being regularly mentioned as a possible challenger to incumbent  for the , Preckwinkle declined to run in the . Preckwinkle declined to make an endorsement in that election, despite the fact that her own county board floor leader, Chuy García, was Emanuel's prime challenger.\n\nIn order to balance increased spending and significant pension debt owed by the county, the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted on July 15, 2015, to pass a measure proposed by Preckwinkle which raised the county's sales tax to the level that it had been prior to her earlier 1% decrease.\n\n]]\n\nOn March 22, 2016, Preckwinkle announced that she had selected Brian Hamer, who served as the state's revenue director under Gov.  and then Quinn, to replace Tasha Green Cruzat as her chief of staff.\n\nPreckwinkle championed a \"soda tax\" taxing all retail sales of sweetened beverages made in the county at a rate of once cent per ounce. The tax was adopted by the county board on November 10, 2016. Exempted from the tax were purchases that were made using  (SNAP) benefits since federal law prohibited state and local taxes from being imposed on purchases made with SNAP benefits. 870,000 Cook County residents received SNAP benefits at the time. The \"soda tax\" was unpopular with Cook County residents. A poll commissioned by the Illinois Manufacturer's Association conducted shortly after the adoption of the tax found 87% disapproval of the tax by Cook County residents. Preckwinkle remained steadfast in her support for the tax. In defense of the tax, Preckwinkle argued that it was a justified means of achieving the public health goal of decreasing Cook County residents' consumption of sugar. She would, after its repeal, admit that health concerns had not been the sole motivation behind adopting the tax, remarking, that the greater motivation for its adoption was the generation of revenue for the county. In October 2017, against Preckwinkle's wishes, the county board repealed the tax by a vote of 15–2. The repeal of the tax created a $200 million hole in the county's budget for 2018.\n\n\n\n\nPreckwinkle was reelected to a third term . Preckwinkle had been challenged by , a former Chicago alderman who attempted to capitalize on the unpopularity of the \"soda tax\". Preckwinkle easily defeated Fioretti, winning 60.82% of the vote to Fioretti's 39.18%. Preckwinkle was unchallenged on the ballot in the general election. During the 2018 elections, anticipating a potential  year for Democrats, Preckwinkle made a concerted effort to increase the Democrats' majority on the Cook County Board of Commissioners, focusing her efforts on three of the Board's four Republican-held seats. Preckwinkle-backed Democratic nominees succeeded in ousting Republican incumbents in the  and  districts, but fell roughly a mere 2,000 votes shy of unseating the 's Republican incumbent. Preckwinkle did not target the Republican-held  seat, as the incumbent Republican, , was both popular and a political  and had a reputation for being a peacemaker on the Board at times when conflict arose between its members.\n\n for a  at a public park in October 2022]]\n\nIn 2018, under Preckwinkle's leadership, Cook County controversially requested an easement to build a road at taxpayer expense (~$750K-$1M) to pave public green space and the 10th hole of the Canal Shores Golf Course in the northern suburbs, which benefited of State Senators President  and a private developer. The easement was approved by the  despite strong opposition by local residents and the  Park District.\n\nIn 2018, Preckwinkle launched an unsuccessful candidacy for mayor of Chicago. She advanced to the runoff of the , but suffered a  against .\n\nPreckwinkle did not make an endorsement ahead of the .\n\n  in May 2022]]\n greet First Lady  in October 2021]]\n\nIn January 2021, the \"Fair Transit South Cook\" pilot program was launched. The three-year pilot program halves the standard fares on 's  and  commuter services. It also expands service and frequency on 's Halsted 352 bus route, which provides a connection between the  and the  Pace bus terminal. The effort to launch this program had been led by Preckwinkle. It is targeted at making transit more affordable and available to those residing in the southern suburbs of Chicago as well as those traveling to those suburbs. The program had an aim of addressing problems of transit access in southern Chicago communities. A mobility study had previous shown that a sizable share of residents of Southern Cook County did not have a personal automobile, spend in excess of half of their income on transit costs, and had work commutes in excess of two hours round-trips. Preckwinkle had been advancing the program since 2019. Chicago Mayor Lightfoot opposed the pilot program, alleging that it draws ridership away from the . An initially-cited primary goal of the program had been to increase ridership on the transit services targeted. In 2022, the pilot program's first annual report claimed that the effort had been successful. While it had not generated the increase in overall ridership than had been hoped for on the Metra services, Cook County leadership touted it as providing an important improvement in transit access for thousands of residents residing in \"transit deserts\". Additionally, despite an overall decline in ridership on the Metra services involved, the study showed that stations in low-income areas along the services saw an increase in ridership.\n\nPreckwinkle advocated for adopting an integrated fare between Metra and Pace services and  services.\n\n\nOn 25 June 2019, during a fundraiser held at the , Preckwinkle reversed a decision she made not to run for another term and announced that she would seek a fourth term as Cook County Board President . She was reelected to a fourth term. In the Democratic primary, Preckwinkle won a landslide victory over former Cook County Commissioner . In his single term on the County Board (from 2014 through 2018), Boykin had previously fought with Preckwinkle on the matter of the \"soda tax\", with Boykin leading the effort that ultimately led to the tax's repeal. In 2018, Preckwinkle supported 's successful campaign to unseat Boykin. In the general election, Preckwinkle again faced Bob Fioretti (who this time ran as the Republican Party's nominee) as well as  nominee Thea Tsatsos. Preckwinkle won 68.54% of the vote to Fioretti's 28.30% and Tsatsos's 3.16%.\n\nFor the runoff election of the , Preckwinkle endorsed the successful candidacy of Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson. Johnson was generally allied with Preckwinkle as a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and his initial county board campaign in 2018 also received Preckwinkle's backing.\n\nIn February 2023, Preckwinkle became co-chair of the new national organization Counties for Guaranteed Income, a group which advocates for the federal government to support  programs. In , Preckwinkle personally endorsed 's campaign to unseat incumbent Democrat  in the election for . The Cook County Democratic Party also endorsed Spyropoulos, who defeated Martinez in the primary for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWith Preckwinkle's support, the county board unanimously approved a resolution in December 2023 that requires most employers in suburban Cook County to provide up to 40 hours of paid leave annually to their employees. The ordinance allowed for suburban municipalities to individually opt-out of this policy. The ordinance went into effect in January 2024.\n\n\n\n\nOn September 20, 2018, Preckwinkle announced her candidacy for  in the  to replace , who had recently announced his decision. not to seek reelection.\n\nPreckwinkle launched a number of challenges to the petitions of several candidates. She received criticism from other candidates for choosing to challenge candidates that were female and people of color. She launched five challenges against candidates that were women.\n\nPreckwinkle was recognized by the public as being connected to alderman . This proved problematic for her candidacy  following Burke's January 2019  for corruption by the FBI. Burke had allegedly pressured fast-food executive Shoukat Dhanani to make an illegal $10,000 donation to Preckwinkle's campaign. Preckwinkle ultimately returned over $100,000 that had been raised for her campaign committee by Burke. She also called for Burke to resign from the city council. Despite denials by Preckwinkle of allegations that she had hired Burke's son as a six-figure county employee as part of a , Preckwinkle was proven to have previously met with Burke just prior hiring his son.\n\n\nAhead of the first round, '''' predicted that many progressive voters, expecting  to advance to runoff and wanting a strong progressive opponent to him, might  for Preckwinkle, even those progressive voters that might also like candidates  and .\n\nPreckwinkle placed second in the primary election, narrowly behind Lightfoot and narrowly ahead of third-place finisher Daley. Because no candidate reached the necessary 50% of the vote needed to win the election outright,  Preckwinkle and Lori Lightfoot advanced to a . In the runoff, both the '''' and the '''' endorsed Lightfoot. Several former candidates, including Mendoza, Chico, , and fourth-place finisher  also endorsed Lightfoot in the runoff. In an additional blow to Preckwinkle, Chuy García, who had been previously an ally of Preckwinkle's and floor leader for her on the Cook County County Board of Commissioners, endorsed Lightfoot. Preckwinkle herself had declined to endorse García's own candidacy in the runoff of the previous 2015 Chicago Mayoral election. Lightfoot held a substantial lead over Preckwinkle in polls conducted during the runoff campaign.\n\nIn the runoff, Preckwinkle highlighted her depth of government experience and sought to emphasize a contrast with Lightfoot's lack of experience in elected office.\n\nLightfoot won the April 2, 2019, runoff election with more than 73% of the vote. Lightfoot won every ward of the city. Preckwinkle had only managed to beat Lightfoot in a mere 20 of the city's 2,069 voting precincts, carrying less than 1% of the city's precincts. At the request of Rev. Jesse Jackson, both Preckwinkle and Lightfoot held a unity press conference at the Rainbow/PUSH headquarters on April 3, 2019, pledging to work together and not to get in the way of each other's political careers.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the 50 wards of the city and the 30 townships of Cook County elect a Democratic Committeeman to the Cook County Central Committee. These committeemen form the official governing body of the Cook County Democratic Party which, among other purposes, endeavors to attract, endorse, and support qualified Democratic candidates for office.\n\nPreckwinkle succeeded Evans as 4th Ward Democratic committeeman in 1992, defeating former Evans administrative assistant Johnnie E. Hill by 6,227 to 2,327 votes in the March 17, 1992, primary election. Evans had filed nominating petitions to run for re-election as committeeman and run for judge of the Cook County Circuit Court, but withdrew his name from the ballot for committeeman in order to concentrate on the judgeship (to which he was elected).\nPreckwinkle was re-elected as 4th Ward Democratic committeeman on March 19, 1996, running unopposed on the ballot after her successful challenges to the nominating petitions of Charles S. Williams and her 1995 and 1999 aldermanic challenger . They were each a few dozen signatures short of the number required to earn a place on the ballot.\nPreckwinkle was re-elected, again running unopposed on the ballot, as 4th Ward Democratic committeeman in March 2000, March 2004, and February 2008.\n\nOn November 6, 2004, the 10 Democratic ward committeemen whose wards make up parts of the 13th Illinois legislative district, voted to appoint  to the state senate seat vacated two days earlier by U.S. Senator-elect . 4th Ward Democratic committeeman Preckwinkle and 5th Ward Democratic committeeman  had the largest says in the appointment, with 29% and 27%, respectively, of the weighted-vote based on the percentage of votes cast in each ward in the 13th legislative district for Obama in the November 5, 2002, general election.\n\nPreckwinkle chairs the ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization. It was among 16 Chicago Democratic ward organizations named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005, with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the  , charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in city-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the general public, but state law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceeding to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an  and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines. It failed to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed.\n\nThe complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was among eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed to the . On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.\n\nPreckwinkle nominated Joseph Berrios for re-election as Chairman of the Democratic Party of Cook County at a meeting of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee on March 3, 2010. At the time Berrios was the incumbent chairman as well as a commissioner with the Cook County Board of Review and the Democratic candidate for Cook County Assessor. Berrios was re-elected.\n\nIn , Preckwinkle was a  from Illinois.\n\n\nPreckwinkle was elected  of the  by acclamation on April 18, 2018, after then chair  lost in a primary challenge as Cook County Assessor.\n\n\nPreckwinkle supported  in his political pursuits. She endorsed him in his campaigns for Illinois Senate in 1995–96, , and  in 2004. She was among those who encouraged Obama to make his first run for the  in 2000, taking a political risk in supporting his unsuccessful challenge to incumbent congressman . She was also an early supporter when he ran for United States Senate in 2004.\n\nWhen Obama was elected in 2004 as a , Preckwinkle had a large say in his  replacement. She became Obama's alderman when he moved from Hyde Park to South Kenwood in June 2005.\n\nPreckwinkle's views on Obama were prominently featured in a July 2008 '''' cover story on then-presidential candidate Barack Obama's political origins.| The article begins by recounting a 1995 meeting between Preckwinkle and Obama in which he discussed a possible run for the Illinois Senate seat then held by . According to ''The New Yorker'', Preckwinkle \"soon became an Obama loyalist, and she stuck with him in a State Senate campaign that strained or ruptured many friendships but was ultimately successful.\"\n\nIn 1997, she successfully challenged the signatures of Obama's opponents in the Democratic Primary for the Illinois Senate, allowing Obama to run unopposed. According to the ''New Yorker'' article, Preckwinkle became \"disenchanted\" with Obama. The article's author suggested that Preckwinkle's \"grievances\" against Obama were motivated by her perception that Obama was disloyal. Preckwinkle still served as an Obama delegate at the .\n\nAhead of the Democratic Party primary in 2018 reelection election for president of the County Board of Commissioners, Obama endorsed Preckwinkle's reelection campaign. However, the following year, Obama opted not to endorse any candidate in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. It had been reported that, during her campaign in runoff of the election, Preckwinkle had unsuccessfully sought to persuade both Barack Obama and his wife  to endorse her faltering candidacy. Barack Obama had not stayed neutral in the city's previous mayoral election, having endorsed Rahm Emanuel's 2015 reelection campaign.\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n*Uncertified results published in the ''Chicago Tribune'' on February 25, 1987\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n*}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 2013, she was married to Zeus Preckwinkle, then a seventh- and eighth-grade teacher at Ancona Montessori School.

He interned for U.S. Congressman  from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996 Lipinski was a legislative staff member for U.S. Congressman . He then served on Cook County State's Attorney 's campaign during the 1996 election season, and later on Devine's transition staff. After a short stint on then-U.S. Congressman 's staff, Lipinski served as a communications staff aide to then-House Minority Leader .\n\nFrom 2000 to 2001, Lipinski taught at the . In 2001, he joined the faculty of the , where he remained until his election to Congress in 2004.\n\n\nLipinski is Catholic and has urged Catholics to put their faith first.\n\n\nIn , Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Wardwhich is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd districthe was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; since the younger Lipinski had not lived regularly in Illinois since 1989 or run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primarythe real contest in this heavily Democratic district. He then bought a home in  as his residence in the district. As expected, Lipinski defeated his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the general election. He went on to win re-election seven times.\n\nIn the  Lipinski won 55% of the vote against two opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote.

The district earned a reputation as being home to s when in the 1980 presidential election it was one of only two Chicago districts (out of nine) to be won by Republican .\n\nLipinski has repeatedly argued that the Democratic Party is moving too far to the left, which he believes helped  become president. As one sign of his distance from the party, during the lame duck period after both he and President Trump had been defeated, he was one of only two Democrats to vote against HR 9051 on December 28, 2020, thus voting against increasing coronavirus economic relief checks, which had been delayed for over six months, from $600 to $2000, even while 44 Republicans voted with the Democrats.\n\nA socially conservative Democrat, Lipinski has a lifetime score of 90% from the League of Conservation Voters, an F grade from the National Rifle Association, and a 91% lifetime rating from the AFL-CIO.

During a hearing of the Research and Technology Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, witness Zach Mottl said this bill would create the first American strategy for manufacturing since Alexander Hamilton's \"Report on Manufactures\" in 1791. The bill became law as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, FY2015. The first National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing was published in October 2018. The Office of Science and Technology Policy is currently working the next plan which the Biden administration is required to release in 2022.\n\n\nLipinski opposed recognition of  until the Supreme Court legalized it nationwide in ''''. In 2011, he supported the , which denied federal benefits to gay couples. The portion of DOMA that prohibited gay marriage was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2013; by 2015, Lipinski had not publicly changed his support for DOMA. Lipinski supported the First Amendment Defense Act, which would prohibit the federal government from requiring that some businesses not discriminate against same-sex couples. In 2009 Lipinski voted for the Hate Crimes Expansion bill, which expands the definition of hate crime and strengthens enforcement of hate-crime laws. Lipinski also voted for the Equality Act in 2019.

The firm handles labor, real estate, commercial and civil rights cases, as well as some criminal defense.\n\nNonetheless, his early interest in Chicago clearly was politics:\nOne of the stories that is told about my start in politics is that on the way home from law school one night in 1948, I stopped by the ward headquarters in the ward where I lived. There was a street-front, and the name Timothy O'Sullivan, Ward Committeeman, was painted on the front window. I walked in and I said, \"I'd like to volunteer to work for  and .\" This quintessential Chicago ward committeeman took the cigar out of his mouth and glared at me and said, \"Who sent you?\" I said, \"Nobody sent me.\" He put the cigar back in his mouth and he said, \"We don't want nobody that nobody sent.\" This was the beginning of my political career in Chicago.\n\nHe spent ten years, 1956 to 1966, in the . He was defeated for reelection in 1966, but \"reinvented himself\" as a community activist, winning election to the  in 1968. In the Illinois House, Mikva was part of the \"Kosher Nostra\", a group of independent, clean Democrats that included future  and Presidential candidate , future Illinois Comptroller and candidate for Governor , and Representative . He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1969 to 1973 and 1975 to 1979.\n\nHe first represented Illinois's , which included the 's lakefront wards including , his residence and the University of Chicago. Both parties attempted to  Mikva out of Congress. The redistricting for the  elections put Hyde Park in the  for the first time since 1903. This would have pitted Mikva against Democratic incumbent  in a nearly 90% black district; moving to stay in the 2nd District would have matched him against Democratic incumbent , who had previously represented the . Mikva instead moved to the North Shore's .\n\nAfter he was defeated by   in 1972, he ran in the  and beat Young with 50.9% of the vote; his status was enhanced in the predominantly Republican, suburban district because he was viewed as critical of the Chicago Democratic establishment. In , he was reelected by 201 votes against Young in a rematch that was one of the most expensive congressional races up to that time. When he defeated Republican State Representative  by 650 votes in 1978, he joked to supporters that he had \"won by a landslide.\" Porter won the seat after Mikva resigned to become a federal judge.\n\n\n]]\n\nMikva was nominated by President  on May 29, 1979, to the , to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. Despite opposition from anti- that spent over $1 million to oppose his nomination, Mikva was confirmed by the  on September 25, 1979 and received his commission on September 26, 1979. He served as Chief Judge from 1991 to 1994. His service terminated on September 19, 1994, due to retirement, after which he became  to President .\n\nDuring his 15 years as judge, including four as Chief Judge, Mikva used his experience in the legislative branch as well as with the conservative Justice Minton to craft his opinions. Mikva's most controversial decisions struck down the Pentagon ban against gay people serving in the U.S. military (overturned on appeal by the circuit sitting , but the ban was ultimately overturned by Executive Order), and - in 1982 - upheld regulation of air bags in automobiles.\n\nIn 1992, while serving as Chief Judge on the D.C. Circuit, Mikva appeared in the  comedy '''' as \"Supreme Court Justice Abner J. Mikva,\" in a scene in which he administers the presidential oath of office to the Vice President (played by ).\n\n\n\nMikva taught law at  and was  under President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 1995, finding himself the oldest member of the White House team, and eventually resigning due to exhaustion. He then returned to the University of Chicago Law School, serving as the Schwarz Lecturer and the senior director of the . While at the University, Mikva came to better know future president , whom he mentored and supported politically. Obama awarded Mikva the  on November 24, 2014. Mikva offered Obama a  position in his judicial office after Obama graduated from , but Obama declined. Future Obama appointee and United States Supreme Court Justice  did serve as one of Mikva's law clerks and was then a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. Mikva also encouraged Obama to listen to preachers to understand public speaking, \"listen[ing] to patterns of speech, how to take people up the ladders. It's almost a Baptist tradition to make someone faint, and, by God, he's doing it now.\"\n\n\n\nMikva served as a mediator through , and was co-chairman of the 's bipartisan Constitutional Amendments Committee. In November 2004, Mikva was an international  of 's contested presidential election. In July 2006,   named Mikva chair of the Illinois Human Rights Commission. In 2009, Illinois Governor  requested that Mikva lead a commission investigating the  for admitting applicants (many of whom were not very well qualified) whose relatives or backers had connections to and had donated money to Illinois state lawmakers.\n\n\n\nMikva and his wife Zoe started the Mikva Challenge in 1997. Mikva Challenge is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose mission is to develop youth to be informed, empowered, and active citizens and community leaders who will promote a just and equitable society. Mikva Challenge has chapters in , , and , and partner sites spanning the country including , , , , , , , , and , , and . The organization helps youth to expand their political desire by working as election judges, volunteering on campaigns, advising city officials, and creating local activism projects to improve their schools and communities. Their motto is \"Democracy is a Verb!\" As of 2020, Mikva Challenge reaches 100,000 youth annually\nin programs in over 3,000 schools across the country.\n\n\n\nMikva died under  care in , , from complications of  on July 4, 2016, aged 90. He was also suffering from  at the time of his death.\n\n\n\nMikva's congressional and judicial papers are archived at the  in Springfield, Illinois.

Beavers who had been appointed by   after the 2006 November elections to succeed her father , Jackson's rival, as alderman of the 7th Ward. Jackson resigned from Chicago City Council, effective January 15, 2013. On February 20, 2013, Jackson pleaded guilty to one count of filing false tax returns, and on August 14, 2013, was sentenced to one year in prison.\n\nShe is the ex-wife of former U.S. Congressman  and erstwhile daughter-in-law of . Her candidacy for the city council of a major city was part of national news stories in '''', and thoughts of her running for a position in the  were noted in ''''.\n\nJackson has also been a longtime political consultant through her solely owned consulting firm J. Donatella & Associates.\n\n\nBorn in , Jackson grew up in .  She is an alumna of  in Akron. Her mother, Sarah Stevens, who is from , worked three jobs cleaning homes to raise Jackson and two other children. Later Jackson helped her mother clean homes to pay her way through , where she earned her bachelor's degree in 1985.  Jackson's father, Robert Stevens, was from Akron. Jackson met her future husband while still a law student at  and he convinced her to transfer to be with him at the , where she earned her  in 1992. The couple married on June 1, 1991.  The Jackson family keeps two homes. They own one in the South Shore community area, which is within both the  that Congressman Jackson represented in the United States House of Representatives and within the seventh  that Sandi Jackson represents on the Chicago City Council. The South Shore home serves as an election base. This home was the featured renovation on an HGTV ''Hidden Potential'' episode, first aired on March 24, 2009.  They also own a home in  in , which served as the family home and base for his service in Congress prior to her election. Prior to being elected, Jackson resided four days a week in Chicago and three days a week in Washington D.C.\n\nThe Jacksons have two children, Jessica Donatella Jackson (born March 13, 2000) and Jesse Louis Jackson, III, who is nicknamed \"Tre\", (born September 19, 2003). Sarah Stevens accompanies the family on commutes between Chicago and Washington. Jessica attended school in the  before Jackson's service on the city council. After Jackson was elected to serve as a full-time politician in a local legislative body in Chicago, she and her husband decided to have their children attend school in Chicago starting in the fall of 2007. Later, however, the family decided to keep their base in Washington. The family's residential choice has been a campaign issue as well as fodder for a local  discussant.\n\nJackson had suffered multiple s before the birth of her two children. In a highly publicized medical case, she lost a boy who was born four months premature at  in 1998. Complications arose while the couple was attending a youth leadership conference in  20 miles east of .  Jackson survived a three-hour surgical removal of a  from her neck on May 7, 2008.  During the 2008  holidays, the family suffered a fire and was forced to spend the holiday season in a downtown hotel. In 2001, Jackson had a  recipe published in \"The Barking Gourmet,\" the  family cookbook.\n\nOn July 14, 2016, Jackson's husband filed for divorce from her in Cook County, Illinois. They reached a settlement in April 2018.\n\n\nEarly in Jackson's political career she served as  for  . After the , she began working for  who had become the Democratic party's nominee for  in the .Jackson and Watkins, pp. 36-7\n\nJackson's political career prior to her election as 7th Ward Alderman included the following positions: Deputy Director of Training for the , Director of Scheduling Operations for Rev. , Vice President of Congressional and External Affairs for the  (appointed by ), Director of VIP Relations for the  Committee, National Outreach Coordinator for the Clinton/ 96 Campaign, and campaign manager and chief political strategist for many other politicians.\n\nDuring the , Jackson was listed as an Illinois state co-chair of GoreNet. GoreNet was a young-Americans focused group that supported the  with a focus on  and  organizing as well as hosting small dollar donor events.\n\n\nWhile Jackson was serving as the Export-Import Bank's director of congressional affairs, she lobbied in opposition of her husband's proposal to tighten the restrictions on the activities in Africa of the Export-Import Bank. She did so successfully, as her husband's amendment failed.\n\nJackson considered running for public office during the 2003 Chicago municipal elections.  At the time, Jackson, Jr. discouraged his wife from running for public office.  However, he felt his wife should be eligible to run for Alderman, despite the controversy surrounding such a candidacy.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, William Beavers announced that he would resign his 7th ward aldermanic seat to pursue the  seat being vacated by , after Stroger was forced to resign following a . Beavers requested that Mayor Daley appoint his daughter to replace him, in order for her to have the incumbency advantage in the February 27, 2007 municipal elections.  The deal also allowed for  to replace his father John as the president of the County Board and Beavers to surrender his ward seat after presiding over Mayor Daley's 2007 City Council budget hearings. In July 2007, when it first became public that Sandi Jackson was considering running for the 7th ward alderman seat, which would disrupt all the backroom dealings between the Strogers and the Beaverses with Daley's approval, Jackson, Jr. encouraged her to run.  In the November 2006 elections, William Beavers won the County Board seat while Stroger won the County Board President's office that had been part of the dealings. On December 5, 2006, Jackson officially filed paperwork with state election officials.  On December 12, Mayor Daley appointed Darcel Beavers to succeed her father until the Spring municipal elections.  Then, on December 18, which is the filing deadline for petitions, Jackson filed 5,000 petition signatures to run for alderman.\n\nJackson carried numerous endorsements including The  and numerous labor unions. Jackson was not endorsed by the .\n\nThe Jackson family (Sandi, , and Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr.) have occasionally not seen eye to eye with Mayor Daley.  In fact,  Jackson was considering contesting Daley for Mayor until the  success in the 2006 fall elections made it clear he could be very productive by remaining in Congress because of his party's majority.  Sandi Jackson, who is credited with encouraging Jackson, Jr. to run for Congress, had been supportive of the idea of him running for mayor. William Beavers had been a longtime Daley ally. However, Jackson says she has good relations with the Daleys, especially .\n\nJackson took leave from her position as deputy political director of training for the Democratic National Committee to run and her husband bought up the s in the ward to post an image of the couple.  Jackson, Jr. had acquired the rights to 1,800 billboards in the city in preparation for his own possible mayoral candidacy.  He relinquished the rights to all but those useful to his wife in her ward and a few candidates that he endorsed.  Jackson, Jr. invested 200,000 in his wife's campaign to pay for billboards, mailers, phone banks, a campaign manager and other professional staffers.  William Beavers was unimpressed with the spending and had his employees remind voters that Jackson did not live in the Ward and his daughter did. William Beavers attempted to make Jackson's Washington residence an issue, and there was mudslinging in the public press between the Beaverses and the Jacksons.  Jackson campaigned for the 7th ward alderman position based on the issues of economy, education, and public safety.  She also described the lakefront ward as prime  ripe for development.\n\n\n*Darcel Beavers 4004 (33.50%)\n*Ron David 951 (7.96%)\n*Eric Brown 216 (1.81%)\n*Jackson 6783 (56.74%)\nBeavers was one of only four incumbents on the 50-member City Council to lose during the municipal elections. Five new alderman supported by  and Jackson Jr. won seats.\n\n\nThe city of Chicago is divided into fifty wards that are each represented by an alderman in the Chicago City Council.  The northern portion of Chicago's seventh ward is adjacent to the  lakefront, and the ward includes portions of the , , , and  .\n\nJackson's aldermanic career began inauspiciously when she complained to the '''', one of Chicago's major daily newspapers, that she was caught off-guard by the need to pay office start-up expenses up front.  This provided fodder for a columnist in the '''', the other major daily, and anonymous on-line commenters on the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' web site made light of the issue. At the time, Jackson was considered by one local political writer as the most closely watched of the nine newly elected aldermen that were sworn in on May 21, 2007 and by another as the \"star\" of the incoming class of nine freshman aldermen.\n\nHer first political statement as an alderman was disappointment in Mayor Daley's decision to force his affordable housing ordinance through the council with nine  councilmen during the week before the new class was sworn in because new alderman would be \"forced to live by\" the new ordinance.  Meanwhile, her husband propounded a 10-point ethics reform that would give the city's inspector general power to investigate aldermen; reduce the number of City Council committees to 10; limit municipal campaign contributions for each election cycle; and strip the mayor of the authority to appoint replacements for aldermanic vacancies.\n\nUpon assuming office, she stated that she would emphasize  as her primary goal for her ward. One of her goals has been to redevelop the   on the site of the former  mill into a lakefront community.\n\nA local political writer immediately looked for signs that the nine new councilmen who were supported by pro-labor forces would form a block against the pro-business Mayor and old guard members.  Five of the new members were among eleven dissenters in a vote on mandatory public art purchase procedures during their first month on the job. In the fall of 2007, Jackson along with several other African-American alderman took issue with the allotment of contracts on the  runway expansion project because African-American firms were only awarded 8% of the contracts and no  roles. (Jackson's husband is a main proponent of the  in ). Jackson voted with the minority in the 29-21 vote approving the Mayor's November 2007  increase.  The February 2008 Real Estate Transfer Tax Increase also drew opposition from Jackson and a small minority of aldermen.\n\nJackson was among the co-sponsors of a council resolution in opposition of U.S. military attacks against .\n\nThere has been international press covering the City Council's deliberations regarding  and the . Mayor Daley has propounded a controversial proposal to relocate the Chicago Children's Museum from  to a City park, Grant Park that passed 33&ndash;16, with Jackson in the minority.\n\nJackson called attention to ' newly imposed  handling fees for even the first checked bag.  She claimed that the fees were contrary to Section 26-04 of the Airport Use Agreement with the City of Chicago, which is the contract that permits American Airlines to be a carrier in Chicago airports.  The initial plan exempted Platinum and Executive card holders who were generally business travelers and placed an inordinate burden of new fees on the common traveler in contravention of the non-discriminatory price agreement in the agreement. She expressed interest in a City Council forum on the issue.  She wrote directly to American Airlines and then wrote an article in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' on the issue.\n\nJackson was among the councilman and citizens who expressed outrage at the light punishment issued by the mayor's office over a multimillion-dollar city contract scheme. Jackson viewed it as a moral issue where the Mayor did not appropriately condemn immoral activity, which in her eyes encourages similar behavior. During a Summer 2008  rash she was among the aldermen calling for refocussed emphasis on adequate police support.\n\nShe continues to tout a plan to redevelop the USX steel mill as an effort to revitalize her ward.  She foresees 17,000 new residences, a high-end mall, and significant amounts of parkland with construction beginning in 2009.  By the beginning of her second year on the 50-person city council, Jackson had already amassed the 17th largest pool of campaign funds.\n\nShe has been vocal in pursuit of transparency on the issue of whether Mayor Daley should transfer the monitoring of city hiring to Inspector General David Hoffman and has voted against the mayors proposal to create a separate Office of Compliance.  Her voting record earned her praise from the . A year and a half into Jackson's first term, local political commentator Don Rose writing in the '''' included Jackson among four aldermen he considered to be inheriting a mantle of reform.\n\nIn 2001, the  ruled that Jackson, Jr. could hire his wife on his campaign payroll. The ruling stated that relatives can be employed as long as they were compensated \"no more than the fair market value\" for their services.  At the time, Sandi Jackson was employed by the  (DNC) as the deputy director of training. Many other lawmakers have made similar arrangements without contacting the FEC for a ruling. When   was charged with ethical infractions, matters such as these came to light. Jackson remained on the payroll of her husband's main campaign fund, Jesse Jackson Jr. for Congress, in 2006 as she considered a run for public office.  She also continued to be employed by  of the DNC. Between 2001 and early 2009, Jesse Jackson Jr.'s congressional campaign paid Sandra at least $247,500, including at least $95,000 after Sandra became Alderman.\n\nJackson received a $4,000  from Chicago's Office of Emergency Management and Communications (Chicago's 911 Center) to monitor  and emergency operations in her ward.  The radio was returned when the controversy that arose led to a personnel reshuffling that included the reassignment of a high ranking Hispanic city employee.\n\nWhen Congressman  was battling , '''' and other publications mentioned Jackson as a potential future candidate for the  in .  Responding to resignation requests, Rush noted that he would be returning to his congressional duties following post-operative treatment.  When he returned to full health he noted his disappointment in the premature consideration of his replacement.  The issue led to a public reconciliation initiated by Jackson, Jr. at the , termed a \"hugfest\" by the press. While considering the possibility of Jackson, Jr. being appointed to fill 's  seat, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' mentioned her as a possible candidate for Jackson, Jr.'s  seat.\n\nDuring the , Jackson's name was mentioned in the  activities of then- .  Allegedly, the governor had considered her for the state lottery director and then asked for contributions from her husband Congressman Jackson.  After the Congressman Jackson did not make a contribution, she was not selected and Blagojevich made the causality of the non-contribution in the matter.\n\nIn 2008, her second year as alderman, Jackson directed more than $32,000 in payments from her aldermanic expense account to her  account. Jackson said she used an AmEx account to launch her office during her freshman term.\n\n\nIn 2012 federal prosecutors reviewed evidence that Jackson faced potential criminal liability for misuse of her husband's campaign funds; allegedly she and the Congressman used campaign funds to decorate their Washington, DC home. Jackson resigned from Chicago City Council, effective January 15, 2013. On February 15, 2013 Jackson agreed to a plea deal. On February 20, 2013, Jackson pleaded guilty to one count of filing false tax returns after neglecting to declare nearly $580,000 in income.\n\nOn August 14, 2013, Jackson was sentenced to 12 months in federal prison, while her husband was sentenced to 30 months in jail. Judge  said she'd let the couple decide who should first serve out their prison term.  Court documents also showed she had spent campaign funds on personal items such as vacations, electronics and furs.  She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution. She entered the  in  to begin her sentence on October 20, 2015 after her husband was paroled. She completed her prison term on October 18, 2016 and began 12 months of supervised release.\n\n\nIn October 2007, Jackson filed to pursue William Beavers' 7th ward Democratic  post.  Among other duties, committeemen determine appointments for vacated political posts in and including their ward.  Two days later, Beavers filed to run to retain his position. In the race for the local post, her husband requested permission from the  to use his campaign funds in support of her local race. The commission voted in favor of allowing unlimited contributions to his wife's candidacy from his $827,000 fund. On February 5, 2008, Sandi Jackson defeated rival William Beavers in the election for 7th Ward Democratic Committeemen by 77.5%&ndash;22.5%., a 3&ndash;1 margin over Beavers.\n\nJackson has also been a long-time political consultant through her solely owned consulting firm J.

He was succeeded by Democrat Ann Wheeler.\n\n\nAfter Stewart took his seat as chair in 2007, the Prince William County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution designed to purge the county of undocumented immigrants; the new law allowed the  to check the immigration status of anyone, even if they were not suspected of wrongdoing. Additionally, the board directed county staff to cut off public services to illegal immigrants, including drug counseling, elderly services, services to the homeless, and business licenses.

In June 2016, the  selected Stewart to co-chair its \"Team Virginia\" field and communications campaign, alongside former Virginia governor .\n\nStewart drew controversy in July 2016 when he blamed \"liberal Democrats\" including Democratic presidential candidate  and Virginia lieutenant governor  for the . Stewart criticized Democrats for \"essentially encouraging the murder.\"\n\nOn October 10, 2016, amid reports that the  was withdrawing resources from the Trump campaign to focus on down-ballot races, Stewart joined a pro-Trump women's demonstration in front of the committee's , headquarters. Following the protest, Trump campaign CEO  dismissed Stewart to \"placate\" RNC chairman , who was reportedly \"infuriated\" by Stewart's actions. Days later, the RNC and the Trump campaign announced that they were withdrawing from Virginia, again drawing the ire of Stewart, who criticized the decision as a betrayal of the grassroots and \"totally premature.\" Despite his firing, he continued to support Trump.\n\n\n\nAt the Virginia State Republican Convention on April 30, 2016, Stewart announced his intent to run for governor of Virginia.

Virginia GOP chairman John Whitbeck rebuked the remarks, calling some of Stewart's language \"racist\", and noted that the term \"cuckservative\" is \"used by white nationalists\". Stewart also said that he and his campaign had been editing his  page since at least May 2014 to remove unflattering information and add positive spin, through at least two registered accounts.\n\nIn May 2017, while speaking at Temple Rodef Shalom in Fairfax County, Stewart blamed progressives in the United States for an uptick in anti-Semitic incidents throughout the United States, saying, \"Today most of the anti-Semitic bigotry is not coming from the right.

He posted on Twitter, \"It appears ISIS has won. They are tearing down historical monuments in New Orleans now too. It must end. Despicable!\" In his defense of Confederate monuments, he compared \"those who wanted to remove the statue to tyrants and Nazis\". Without Confederate symbols, he said at another event, \"we lose our identity\".\n \nDuring the campaign, Stewart distinguished himself among Virginia politicians by not condemning the white supremacists who marched in the  in Charlottesville in 2017.

It is what makes us Virginia.\" He also claimed that the Confederate flag was totally unrelated to racism or slavery. \"I'm proud to be next to the Confederate flag,\" Stewart said. \"That flag is not about racism, folks, it's not about hatred, it's not about slavery.

He promised a \"very vicious, ruthless race\", claiming that Republicans \"are looking for a more aggressive populist candidate\".\n\nIn December 2017, it was reported that the  leadership was \"maneuvering with help from the national GOP\" to block Stewart's nomination. On December 5, Stewart received the endorsement of , president of . Conservative talk show host  and former White House chief strategist  expressed support for Stewart, with Bannon having previously called Stewart the \"titular head of the Trump movement\" in Virginia. After Stewart won the Republican nomination in June 2018, it was widely reported that Republican lawmakers feared that Stewart's rhetoric would adversely impact other Republicans in the state. Former Republican lieutenant governor  said, \"I am extremely disappointed that a candidate like Corey Stewart could win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. This is clearly not the Republican Party I once knew, loved and proudly served. Every time I think things can't get worse they do, and there is no end in sight.\" Shortly after Stewart's primary victory, several senior leaders of the Virginia Republican Party resigned, but did not say Stewart's primary victory had anything to do with it.\n\nIn a tweet on December 8, 2017, Stewart revived the  by suggesting that former president 's birth certificate and   Beverly Nelson's yearbook were forgeries.

Davis' speech drew bipartisan applause from the chamber.\n\nStewart stirred controversy in June 2018 when it was reported that he had praised and paid far-right commentator . In January 2017, Stewart called Nehlen one of his \"personal heroes\" and said he was \"inspired\" by Nehlen's attempt to oust House speaker  in a Republican primary. Nehlen had previously made  comments, promoted fringe conspiracy theories and promoted content by . In June 2018, five months after Nehlen made controversial anti-Semitic statements, Stewart disavowed Nehlen and said that he no longer considered Nehlen one of his heroes.\n\nDuring the campaign, Stewart sought and received the support of the , an  group that advocates  and compares homosexuality to pedophilia. The founder of the group has claimed that Obama is a \"child molester\" and promoted the . Stewart pledged to the group that he would oppose \"'Transgender Bathrooms' legislation and regulations - which have the effect of encouraging and protecting pedophiles\". Stewart also agreed that public schools should be \"prevented from brainwashing elementary school children with the Homosexual Agenda\".

In May 2019, Stewart shifted the focus of Keeping America Great to helping down-ballot Republicans after criticism from Trump campaign officials who preferred that donors direct their support in the presidential election to another super PAC.\n\n\nIn November 2020, Stewart was appointed as the principal deputy assistant secretary for export administration at the .

Morton was Evanston's first African-American mayor, first Democratic mayor, and longest-serving mayor. She is also notable for spearheading the  of Evanston's public schools as a teacher and school principal.\n\n\n\nMorton was born in , the youngest child of Keziah Hairston, a schoolteacher, and William Patrick Hairston, a prosperous businessman who helped found the Winston Mutual Life Insurance Company (now the Golden Gate Insurance Company). She received a bachelor's degree in education in 1938 from  in North Carolina and a master's degree in curriculum (education) from  in 1942. She moved to Evanston in 1953 with her husband, Dr. James T. Morton Jr. (1911-1974) who was a clinical psychologist and worked at .  Both Morton and her husband taught at the  before moving to Evanston. The couple had one daughter and two grandchildren.\n\n\n\nPrior to her experience in municipal government, Morton was an educator in the  school system from 1953 to 1989. She began teaching in Evanston in 1953 at the now-closed Foster Elementary School, which was at that time the only elementary school for African-Americans in Evanston. Morton then went on to teach at Nichols Middle School from 1957-1966 and Chute Middle School from 1966–1977, becoming the first African-American educator to teach in an Evanston school outside of Foster School. In 1977, after twenty-five years of teaching in the District 65 school system, Morton was appointed principal of Evanston's  and held the position until she retired from teaching in 1989.

She was in office for sixteen years (until 2009), becoming Evanston's longest-serving mayor.\n\nDuring her long mayoral tenure, Morton attempted to improve the town-gown relationship between Northwestern University and the greater population of Evanston. She was able to form a close friendship with Northwestern University president  and ameliorate the tension between Evanston and the University given her status as both the Mayor of Evanston and a proud alumna of Northwestern.\n\nMayor Morton also worked with local community leaders and churches to create a safe zone and a \"time out\" period of time that gangs would call a truce. During this time, (Friday and Saturday nights, a time of would-be heightened gang activity) the community, including gang members were invited to play basketball at Evanston's Robert Crown Center. Morton would often be seen cheering from the sidelines\n\n\n\nBoth of her alma maters have recognized Morton's achievements. Winston-Salem State University created the Lorraine Hairston Morton Endowed Scholarship in 2010 for students majoring in education who are committed to community service.

In the , he failed to obtain an absolute majority in the first round but defeated Cook County board commissioner  in the subsequent run-off election. In late 2015, Emanuel's approval rating plunged to \"the low 20s\", in response to a series of scandals.\n\nIn October 2017, Emanuel announced he planned to run for a third term, but reversed his decision on September 4, 2018. The '''' assessed Emanuel's performance as mayor as \"mixed\", and at one point half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel's resignation. He left office in May 2019 and was succeeded by . In August 2021, President  nominated Emanuel to be the ; he was confirmed by the  in December of that year.\n\n\n\nEmanuel's father, Benjamin M. Emanuel, was born in . He moved to the United States to work as a  at .\n\nThe surname ''Emanuel'' (: ), which means \"God is with us\", was adopted by their family in memory of Rahm's uncle (his father's brother) Emanuel Auerbach, who was killed in 1933 in an altercation with Arabs in Jerusalem.\n\nEmanuel's maternal grandfather was a  who emigrated from . His mother, Marsha (née Smulevitz), is the daughter of a West Side Chicago labor union organizer who worked in the . She briefly owned a local  club, and later became an adherent of 's writings.\n\nEmanuel's parents met during the 1950s in Chicago. Emanuel was born on November 29, 1959, in Chicago, Illinois. His first name, ''Rahm'' () means ''high'' or ''lofty'' in . He attended  in Lakeview for elementary school. He has been described by his older brother , an  and  at the , as \"quiet and observant\" as a child. , his younger brother, is the CEO of , an entertainment agency with headquarters in . Rahm Emanuel also has a younger adopted sister, Shoshana.\n\n\nWhile he lived in Chicago, Emanuel attended the . After his family moved to , north of the city, Emanuel attended public schools: Romona School, , and . He and his brothers attended summer camp in Israel, including the summer following the June 1967 . Ezekiel has written that their father \"did not believe in falsely building his sons' self-esteem by purposefully letting us win, or tolerating sloppy play\". About Rahm, he also wrote:\n\n\n\nRahm was encouraged by his mother to take ballet lessons, and is a graduate of the Evanston School of Ballet, as well as a student of The Joel Hall Dance Center, where his children later took lessons. He won a scholarship to the , but turned it down to attend , a liberal arts school with a strong dance program. This background, as well as the Ambassador’s short stature, led some critics to nickname him \"tiny dancer\". While an undergraduate, Emanuel was elected to the Sarah Lawrence Student Senate. He graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts in , and went on to receive a Master of Arts in  and  from  in 1985.\n\nEmanuel took part in a two-week civilian volunteer holiday, known as the , where, as a civilian volunteer, he assisted the  during the 1991 , helping to repair truck brakes in one of Israel's northern bases.\n\nWhile a high school student working part-time at an  restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right middle finger on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in . His finger was partially  due to the severity of the infection.\n\n\nEmanuel began his political career with the  and  organization Illinois Public Action. He went on to serve in a number of capacities in local and national politics, initially specializing in fund-raising for Illinois campaigns, and then nationally.\n\nEmanuel worked for Democrat 's  to the . He also worked as the national campaign director for the  in , and was senior advisor and chief fund-raiser for 's successful initial campaign for , in . He subsequently worked for Illinois Attorney General , conducting opposition research for his .\n\nAt the start of then- 's , Emanuel was appointed to direct the campaign's finance committee. Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fund-raising and delay campaigning in . Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fund-raising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton's character threatened to swamp the campaign during the . Clinton's primary rival,  (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations consultant who worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: \"It was that [extra] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [over Clinton's relationship with  and the controversy over his  status during the ].\" Emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with \"heavily Jewish\" donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million. While working on the Clinton campaign, Emanuel was paid a retainer by the investment bank .\n\n\n in 1993]]\nFollowing the campaign, Emanuel served as a senior advisor to Clinton at the  from 1993 to 1998. In the White House, Emanuel was initially Assistant to the President for Political Affairs and then Senior Advisor to the President for Policy and Strategy. He was a leading strategist in White House efforts to institute , among other Clinton initiatives.\n\nEmanuel is known for his \"take-no-prisoners style\" that has earned him the nickname \"\". Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results. On the night after the , angry at Democrats and Republicans who \"betrayed\" them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a steak knife into the table and began rattling off names while shouting \"Dead! Dead! Dead!\". Before  gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair \"Don't fuck this up!\" while Clinton was present. Blair and Clinton both burst into laughter. However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel were saying that he has \"mellowed out\". Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents. The character  in '''' was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer  denied this.\n\n\nAfter serving as an advisor to Bill Clinton, in 1998 Emanuel resigned from his position in the administration and joined the  firm , where he worked for  years. Although he did not have an MBA degree or prior banking experience, he became a managing director at the firm's Chicago office in 1999, and according to congressional disclosures, made $16.2 million in his  years as a banker. At Wasserstein Perella, he worked on eight deals, including the acquisition by  of  and the purchase by  of the SecurityLink home security unit from .\n\n\nIn 2000, Emanuel was named to the Board of Directors of  by President Clinton. He earned at least $320,000 during his time there, including later stock sales. During Emanuel's time on the board, Freddie Mac was plagued with scandals involving campaign contributions and accounting irregularities. The Bush administration rejected a request under the  to review Freddie Mac board minutes and correspondence during Emanuel's time as a director. The  later accused the board of having \"failed in its duty to follow up on matters brought to its attention\". Emanuel resigned from the board in 2001 before his first bid for Congress.\n\nDuring this time he served on the Board of Commissioners of the .\n\n\n and Rep.

His strongest opponent in the crowded primary of eight was former Illinois state representative Nancy Kaszak. During the primary, , president of the , a  endorsing Kaszak, called Emanuel a \"millionaire \". Emanuel won the primary and defeated  candidate Mark Augusti in the . Emanuel's inaugural election to the House with 67% was the closest he ever had for this seat, as he subsequently won more than 70% in all of his re-election bids.\n\n\n in ]]\nEmanuel was elected after the October 2002  authorizing the , and so did not vote on it. However, in the lead up to the resolution, Emanuel spoke out in support of the war.\n\nIn January 2003, Emanuel was named to the  and sat on the subcommittee that oversaw Freddie Mac. A few months later, Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Leland Brendsel was forced out and the committee and subcommittee commenced more than a year of hearings into Freddie Mac. Emanuel skipped every hearing allegedly for reasons of avoiding any appearance of favoritism, impropriety, or conflict of interest.\n\nEmanuel aligned himself with the .\n\n\nEmanuel assumed the position of  chairman (DCCC) after the death of the previous chair, . Emanuel led the Democratic Party's effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. The documentary '''', featuring Emanuel, chronicles those elections. Emanuel had disagreements over Democratic election strategy with  Chairman . Dean favored a \"\", building support for the Democratic Party over the long term, while Emanuel advocated a more tactical approach focusing attention on key districts.\n in , Colorado ]]\n\nThe Democratic Party gained 30 seats in the House in the , and Emanuel received considerable praise for his stewardship of the DCCC, even from Illinois Republican Rep. , who said, \"He legitimately can be called the golden boy of the Democratic Party today. He recruited the right candidates, found the money, and funded them, and provided issues for them. Rahm did what no one else could do in seven cycles.\"\n\nHowever, Emanuel also faced some criticism for his failure to support some progressive candidates, as Howard Dean advocated. Emanuel had \"aggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans\". Many of the Representatives that Rahm had recruited, such as , ended up \"[voting] against important Obama administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care\". Howie Klein has suggested that Emanuel's congressional campaign strategy was short-sighted, as it \"contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities we have now, the biggest since the nineteen-twenties\" when the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 mid-term elections.\n\nAfter Emanuel's election as chairman of the Democratic Caucus (see below),  became committee chair for the 110th Congress.\n\n\nAfter his role in helping the Democrats win the 2006 elections, Emanuel was believed to be a leading candidate for the position of . Nancy Pelosi, who became the next , persuaded him not to challenge , but instead to succeed Clyburn in the role of . In return, Pelosi agreed to assign the caucus chair more responsibilities, including \"aspects of strategy and messaging, incumbent retention, policy development, and rapid-response communications\". Caucus vice-chair  remained in his role instead of running for the chairman position.\n\nAfter Vice President  asserted that he did not fall within the bounds of orders set for the , Emanuel called for cutting off the $4.8 million the Executive Branch provides for the Vice President's office.\n\n\n to advocate changes to  legislation, September 24, 2003]]\n;Social issues\nEmanuel is generally  on . He has maintained a 100-percent  voting record, supports  including , and is a strong supporter of gun control, rated \"F\" by the NRA in December 2003. , , November 14, 2008 He has also strongly supported the banning of numerous rifles based upon \"sporting purposes\" criteria.\n\nDuring his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel spoke in support of the goal of \"to help make health care affordable and available for all Americans\".\n\nIn his 2006 book, co-authored with Bruce Reed, ''The Plan: Big Ideas for America'', Emanuel advocated a three-month compulsory universal service program for Americans between the ages of 18 and 25. A similar, expanded version of the initiative was later proposed by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\n;Iraq war\nDuring his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel \"indicated his support of 's position on , but said he believed the President needed to better articulate his position to the American people\".\n\nIn the 2006 congressional primaries, Emanuel, then head of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, helped organize a run by , an Iraq war veteran with no political experience, against grassroots candidate Christine Cegelis in Illinois' 6th district. Expedited withdrawal from Iraq was a central point of Cegelis' campaign and Duckworth opposed a withdrawal timetable.\n\n;Middle East\nIn June 2007, Emanuel condemned an outbreak of Palestinian violence in the  and criticized Arab countries for not applying the same kind of pressure on the Palestinians as they have on Israel. At a 2003 pro-Israel rally in Chicago, Emanuel told the marchers that Israel was \"ready for peace\" but would not get there until Palestinians \"turn away from the path of terror\".\n\n\nEmanuel declared in April 2006 that he would support  should she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her at least once a month as chairman of the DCCC. However, Emanuel's loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, , expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: \"I'm hiding under the desk. I'm very far under the desk, and I'm bringing my paper and my phone.\" Emanuel remained neutral in the race until June 4, 2008, the day after the final primary contests, when he endorsed Obama.\n\n, as President Barack Obama talks on the phone on April 4, 2009]]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2008, Emanuel accepted the position of  for US President . He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. , a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he may be interested in running for the seat again in the future.\n\nSome Republican leaders criticized Emanuel's appointment because they believed it went against Obama's campaign promises of less divisive politics, given Emanuel's reputation as a partisan Democrat. Republican Senator  disagreed, saying: \"This is a wise choice by President-elect Obama. He's tough, but fair, honest, direct, and candid.\" Ira Forman, executive director of the , said that the choice indicated that Obama would not listen to the \"wrong people\" regarding the U.S.–Israel relationship. Some commentators opined that Emanuel would be good for the  because if Israeli leaders made excuses for not dismantling settlements, Emanuel would be tough and pressure the Israelis to comply. Some  expressed dismay at Emanuel's appointment.\n\nWeeks after accepting the appointment, Emanuel participated on a panel of corporate chief executive officers sponsored by the '''', and said, \"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\" Emanuel explained later, \"... what I said was, never allow a good crisis to go to waste when it's an opportunity to do things that you had never considered, or that you didn't think were possible.\"\n\nIn a 2009 article in '''', Emanuel was characterized as being \"perhaps the most influential chief of staff of a generation\".\n\nHe has a reputation for his no-holds-barred negotiation style that involves \"his share of shouting and cursing\". Ezekiel Emanuel has written, \"The impatient, pushy Emanuel style is so well known that during a recent job interview I was asked, point-blank, whether I had the level-headed temperament the position required. ... . [A]s obvious as our flaws are to others, it's difficult to recognize them in ourselves.\" At a January 2010 closed-door meeting in the White House with liberal activists, Emanuel called them \"fucking retarded\" for planning to run TV ads attacking conservative Democrats who didn't support Obama's health-care overhaul. After the remarks were quoted in a front-page story of the '''', and after he was criticized by , Emanuel apologized to organizations for mentally disabled people for using the word \"retarded\".\n\nAccording to Jonathan Alter's book, , Emanuel opposed Barack Obama's plan for a broad health care reform, but Obama overrode him. Emanuel advocated a smaller plan because it could get bi-partisan support. Emanuel wanted to expand coverage for children, and increase the number of single mothers eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, it was dubbed \"the Titanic plan\", a reference to the priority given to saving women and children during the sinking of the ''''. Reportedly, House Speaker Pelosi had to convince Obama on the health care initiative after Emanuel dramatically scaled it back. Emanuel has since apologized for his role, saying, \"Thank God for the country, he didn't listen to me\", after the Supreme Court upheld \"ObamaCare\" in 2012.\n\nAs chief of staff, Emanuel would make his staff laugh. During a staff meeting, when   gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel is said to have looked at him and said: \"Whatever you're taking, I want some.\" Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, political maneuvering, communications and economic policy.  wrote in '''' that Emanuel made a habit of telephoning   and asking about the  aimed at , asking, \"Who did we get today?\".\n\nIn 2010, Emanuel was reported to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in mid-term elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn September 30, 2010, it was announced that Emanuel would leave his post as White House Chief of Staff to run for . He was replaced by  on October 2, 2010.\n\nEmanuel entered the race with high-, having not only a sizable local profile, but also a sizable national profile.\n\nEmanuel's eligibility for office was challenged on the basis of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. This was the period when Emanuel was in Washington serving as the White House chief of staff. The Board of Elections and the  affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the  resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.\n\nIn the race, Emanuel had a financial advantage over the other candidates. He was by far the best-financed candidate, with more than three times the campaign funds as the second-best financed candidate (), and more than twenty-times the third-best financed candidate (). Emanuel's had his financial advantage from the very start of his candidacy, as he began his campaign with approximately $1.2 million from his congressional campaign fund. By December 31, 2010, he had raised more than $10.5 million in additional funds. On January 1, 2011, the Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act took effect, limiting individual personal contributions to candidates to $5,000. Nevertheless, he continued to raise substantial funds, ultimately having procured a total $15 million over the course of his campaign (including those funds transferred from his congressional campaign committee). Emanuel was able to raise so much because he had experience fundraising, had built a Washington connections and a national profile, and his brother Ari had Hollywood connections. He had 75 contributors give more than $50,000, twenty-five of which were from out of state. Among these high-dollar contributors were , , and . Despite having a national fundraising operation, three-quarters of his donations came locally. More than $800,000 of his contributions were from financial exchange and trading executives, with his largest single donation being a $200,000 donation from executives of the .\n\nEmanuel proposed lowering the city's  and raising the service tax. Emanuel supported negotiating with the  for longer school days and school years. Emanuel opposed instituting an elected school board.  This received criticism from other candidates.\n\nOther candidates assailed his tenure at Freddie Mac.\n\nAs the frontrunner, Emanuel had gotten more press coverage than other mayoral candidates. This was furthered by the fact that the challenge to his residency became a dominant headline.\n\nEmanuel entered the race with solid backing from North and Northwest Side Democratic Ward Committeemen.\n\nEmanuel's advertisements showed portrayed him as having strong roots in the city, and, in telling his biography, emphasized his upbringing on the . Contrarily, Emanuel's opponents attempted to characterize him as a , hailing not from the city itself but rather from the North Shore and Washington, D.C. Emanuel's advertisements also sought to emphasize his tenures in working in the White House and his tenure as a congressman. Emanuel would highlight his relations with presidents Clinton and Obama. He also sought to highlight the fact that he had forged connections in Washington during his time in congress, and also had strong business ties.\n\nEmanuel had overwhelming support from Jewish and  voters. Emanuel held a lead with independent progressives, including strong support from the  voting bloc of wealthy white progressives from the city's northern lakefront. As the only white candidate in the race, Emanuel was seen as likely to receive unified support from a majority of the white electorate. Since the Hispanic vote was largely split between two Hispanic candidates (Gery Chico and ), once Emanuel was able to secure the support of the majority of the black vote, he had secured himself victory.\n\nIn attracting African American voters to his candidacy, Emanuel was helped by his associations with Presidents Clinton and Obama, both of whom were extremely popular among the African American community. After Moseley Braun's support began to crater following a character attack on fellow candidate  which backfired, Emanuel was the beneficiary as the, largely African American, voters that abandoned their support of Moseley Braun's candidacy primarily migrated to support his candidacy. Once this happened, Emanuel had all but secured himself a first-place finish, and the remaining candidates were left to jockey for second-place in hopes of there being a runoff.\n\nEmanuel carried the endorsements of both the city's major daily newspapers, the '''' and the ''''.\n\nEmanuel's mayoral campaign was the inspiration for a satirical Twitter account called MayorEmanuel, which received more than 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel's actual Twitter account. Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author would reveal himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author's choice. When Chicago journalist Dan Sinker revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a community organization which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.\n\n Obama presidential reelection campaign office]]\nEmanuel was elected on February 22, 2011, with 55% of the vote, and was sworn in as the   on May 16, 2011, at the . At his inauguration were outgoing Mayor , Vice President , Labor Secretary , Treasury Secretary , former Mayor , and , brother of the outgoing mayor and who would later serve as White House Chief of Staff. Emanuel was Chicago's first Jewish mayor.\n\n\n\nIn August 2014, '''' poll reported Emanuel had a 35% approval rating as mayor of Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, Emanuel won 56 percent of the vote in the run-off election against Jesús \"Chuy\" García held on April 7, 2015. He had been hurt by sharp neighborhood criticism of his decision to shut down 50 public schools in black and Latino neighborhoods, and his installation of s, together with anger at the high level of gun violence on the streets. On the other hand, he was supported by the business community and most elements of the Democratic party.\n\n\nIn February 2016, Chicago Tribune polls reported that Emanuel approval ratings had dropped to 27%, for his role as the Mayor of Chicago.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune stated that this all-time record low job approval confirms a \"public crisis in confidence\" for Emanuel who had been subjected to weeks of public protests, allegations of him covering up the  police shooting video, as well as federal civil rights investigation of his police department. For several months, Emanuel claimed that making the video public would jeopardize a federal investigation into the shooting and had refused to allow the video to be shown to the public, even though the Justice Department had not raised any issues with the public release of the footage. It wasn't until a judge forced its release that it was later seen that the contents in the video contradicted the police's narrative of what had occurred. Public backlash resulted from Emanuel's handling of the video, with a \"steady barrage\" of \"Resign Rahm\" protests since November\".\n\nAccording to Chicago Tribunal polls, the majority didn't believe Emanuel to be honest nor trustworthy, and 83 percent of polled Chicagoans didn't believe Emanuel's statements on the video, and 68 percent felt that he was not justified in withholding the video from the public. In response to the public backlash, Emanuel forced the resignation of Chicago's police chief, Garry McCarthy, as well as generating a plan that promised to reform the city's police department.\n\n\n\nEmanuel announced in October 2017 that he was running for reelection in 2019, despite low approval ratings and some potentially serious challengers. In September 2018, Emanuel decided to not run for reelection. Close friend  told ''USA Today'' that Emanuel had grown uncertain about his devotion to a third term. Emanuel had been leading in the polls prior to his decision to withdraw. However according to  citing data from , Rahm Emanuel had a lead over most of his potential challengers but it was \"not enough to win the contest outright\" and that in a head-to-head matchup with , Vallas actually had a polling lead over Emanuel with 39 percent to 33. In an interview with the ''Chicago Tribune'', Emanuel stated that he had been conferring with his wife and children for months before announcing the decision and that he felt it was time to \"write the next chapter.\"Bill Ruthhart,  , ''Chicago Tribune'' (October 5, 2018).\n\n\nEmanuel assembled a transition team from varied backgrounds. On November 16, the city council voted unanimously to adopt the mayor's first budget, which decreased the budget by $34 million and increased spending by $46.2 million, supported by increasing fees and fines. Despite most Aldermen opposing cuts to library workers and the closure of mental health clinics, they ultimately supported it, calling it \"honest\". At a news conference in November 2012, Emanuel listed his top three priorities for the state legislature as security and pension reform, adding a casino to Chicago, and equal marriage rights for same-sex couples.

Following backlash within the Republican Party from his 2005 independent candidacy, Potts retired from the state senate at the following election.\n\n\nBorn in  on March 4, 1939, Potts graduated from the  with a major in journalism and a minor in political science. Potts served in the U.S. Army Reserves (1958–64).\n\n\nA former sports editor for the '''', Potts held various athletic management and marketing positions with the  and . He was also once vice president of the . In 1982, he founded Russ Potts Productions Inc., a  in sports marketing. The company claims to have promoted many of the biggest and most successful independent sporting events in North America in the past four decades, as well as worked with various collegiate teams, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Potts has been inducted into the , NACMA Hall of Fame (National Association of College Marketing Administrators),  Hall of Fame,  Hall of Fame,  Hall of Fame and the  Hall of Fame.\n\n\nFirst elected to the  in 1991 as a Republican, Potts received 49.6% of the vote in a four-candidate race. He was re-elected by large margins in 1995 and 1999, the latter year only facing a challenger (Mark D. Tate) in the Republican primary. In 2003, he defeated Democrat , who later became Virginia's Attorney General. Potts eventually chaired the Senate Education and Health Committee. Decades earlier,  represented the same Senate district, but Potts actually succeeded fellow Methodist and Republican state senator  (1971–1991). He was succeeded by , who also defeated Mark D. Tate (in the 2007 Republican primary).\n\n\nPotts frequently referred to himself as a \"moderate Republican,\" and criticized the Republican Party for being too far right politically to be in touch with the people it represents. Potts' moderate views on abortion and taxes led some Republicans to label him a .\n\n\nPotts ran as an independent in the . Virginia  disagreed on how he would affect the November gubernatorial election, and the Winchester City Republican Committee disowned him in early March 2005. Both the Kilgore and Kaine campaigns announced his candidacy to be in their favor  the former because of Potts' relatively liberal views, and the latter for his appeal to moderate Republicans. Potts was considered an underdog to both of these candidates, trailing behind them in popular and financial support. Lloyd Ross, founder of the  retail chain and frequent contributor to Republican campaigns, donated $300,000 to the Potts campaign.\n\nIn April 2005, Lieutenant Governor and  gubernatorial candidate , in his role as president of the Senate, refused to entertain a motion to strip Potts of his committee assignments. His ruling was upheld on a 27–9 vote.\n\nKilgore refused to debate Russ Potts, a decision which columnist Barnie Day said could strengthen Potts'  appeal and was a poor decision by Kilgore. It is unclear whether this had any effect on the election's outcome. Russ Potts polled 9% in a Mason-Dixon poll, but then dropped to 6% in a September poll. He needed to poll 15% in two separate polls to qualify for participation in the October Kaine-Kilgore debate. This poll was taken before Potts' TV ads ran. Although Potts was excluded from the final debate, he agreed to be sequestered in an office at Richmond's  during Sunday evening's debate and was not allowed to hear any of the questions nor any of the answers offered by his opponents. Minutes after the debate ended, Potts was taken into WTVR-TV studios where the station played back the debate in real time and recorded Potts' answers to each of the debate questions. \n\nIn the last week of the campaign, Jerry Kilgore's campaign sent out a direct mail piece contrasting Potts with Tim Kaine and encouraging \"progressive\" voters to support Potts. The piece was billed as a \"2005 Official Democrat and Progressive Voter Guide,\" but a notice in small print, turned 90 degrees to the rest of the piece and placed next to a picture so as to resemble a photo credit, noted that it was paid for by \"Virginians for Jerry Kilgore\". The State Board of Elections imposed a $100 fine for the violation.\n\n\nPotts married Emily Strite in 1965, and they had three daughters.\n\nAfter a series of falls, Potts died from  in Winchester on December 19, 2021, aged 82.\n\n\n\n\n\n*  \n* Day, Barnie:  , June 23, 2005.\n* Edds, Margaret:  , The Virginian-Pilot, April 10, 2005.\n* Graham, Chris:  , Augusta Free Press, June 29, 2005.\n* Helderman, Rosalind S.: , The Washington Post, March 9, 2005.\n* , September 19, 2005.\n* Shapiro, Jeff E.: , Richmond Times-Dispatch, April 14, 2005.\n\n\n* ''Follow the Money'' – H Russell Potts Jr\n**    Senate campaign contributions\n** Governor campaign contributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The family maintains several residences, including one in downtown Chicago that enabled her to apply to the Chicago-based school. Although she had top grades, she had missed several days of school and therefore did not qualify through the regular admissions process. It was later revealed that Rauner had sought information on this process from his personal friend , then CEO of . Rauner has said he had no recollection of speaking with Duncan directly. According to another source, she was not a \"principal pick\", but was let in following the phone call between Bruce Rauner and Arne Duncan. The Rauners donated $250,000 to the school during the subsequent school year; Rauner has a long history of contributing to Chicago Public Schools.\n\nOn October 22, 2014, Dave McKinney, a '''' political reporter and bureau chief, resigned from the paper, citing pressure brought to bear on him by ''Sun-Times'' management with regard to his coverage of Rauner. McKinney had completed an investigative news story about a lawsuit filed by Christine Kirk, the CEO of LeapSource, a firm at which Rauner served as director. The piece, written by three reporters and approved by the newspaper's editors, described Rauner using \"hardball tactics\" to threaten Kirk and her family. According to McKinney's attorney, the Rauner campaign requested the story include that McKinney had a conflict of interest due to his marriage to Ann Liston, a Democratic media consultant; the campaign eventually published details about the Liston's LLC sharing office space with a legally separate, long-term Democratic strategist firm, of which Liston was part-owner. The LLC was employed by a pro-Quinn PAC. McKinney says any notion of conflict of interest was untrue, a position backed up publicly by Sun-Times management. Rauner is a former investor of the Sun-Times and received the newspaper's backing, marking the first time the media organization endorsed any candidate after imposing a moratorium on political endorsements three years earlier.\n\nOn November 4, 2014, Rauner was elected ;  conceded defeat the next day. Rauner received 50.27 percent of the vote, while Quinn won 46.35 percent. Rauner carried every county in the state except for , home to Chicago.\n\nRauner spent a record $26 million of his own money on his election.\n\n\nRauner was sworn in as the 42nd  on January 12, 2015. He governed Illinois as a , as evidenced by his stances on , , and immigration, among other issues.\n\nRauner had a 52 percent job  after assuming the governorship in 2015, although it gradually declined during his term. It stood at 33 percent in December 2016, ranking 45th of the 50 U.S. governors. In January 2019, as Rauner was leaving office, his approval rating stood at only 25 percent.\n\n\n\nIn his first executive order, he halted state hiring as well as discretionary spending and called for state agencies to sell surplus property. The conflict between Rauner's demand for budget cuts and Speaker of the House  demand for tax increases resulted in the Illinois Budget Impasse, with major credit agencies downgrading the state's debt to the low investment grade of triple-B by the end of 2015. \n\nOn February 9, 2015, Rauner signed an executive order blocking so called  from state employee paychecks. The same day, Rauner hired a legal team headed by former   and his law firm  to file a  in  to affirm his action. In February 2015, Rauner proposed $4.1 billion in budget cuts affecting , , state employee s, , and local government support. In April, Rauner also suspended funding for programs addressing domestic violence, homeless youth, , and immigrant integration. Critics called these moves \"morally reprehensible\" and harmful to the state economy.\n\nOn June 25, 2015, Rauner vetoed the Illinois state budget passed by the legislature, which would have created a deficit of nearly $4 billion but which covered what Illinois Democratic lawmakers called \"vital services\". He stated that he would not sign a budget until the   passed his \"Turnaround Agenda\" to reduce  power and freeze property taxes. With no state budget, social service agencies cut back on services, state universities laid off staff, public transit service ceased in  and  Counties, and Child Care Assistance eligibility was cut by 90 percent.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, just before the beginning of the next fiscal year, Rauner signed a temporary bipartisan stopgap budget that would allow public schools to continue operating for an additional year and for necessary state services to continue for 6 months. However, the stopgap budget covered only 65 percent of social services agencies' normally allocated funds and provided $900,000 less for colleges and universities than FY15, while attempting to cover eighteen months' worth of expenses, all while continuing the uncertainty that Illinois nonprofits faced during FY16.\n\nIn July 2017, Rauner vetoed a budget that increased the state income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and the corporate tax from 5.25 percent to 7 percent, an increase of $5 billion in additional tax revenue. However, the Illinois legislature, with the help of several Republicans, overrode his veto. Following this action, considered a political defeat for Rauner, he made major changes to his staff; among others, he fired  his chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, and spokesperson, and replaced them with high-ranking officials from the  along with a former spokesperson for  governor . These moves were seen by the media as a shift to the right. In August 2017, Rauner fired several of those new officials after they issued a controversial statement related to race.\n\n\nRauner made a priority to fully fund education for the first time in years, increasing K-12 education funding by nearly $1 billion, and increasing early childhood education funding to historic levels. In 2017, Rauner signed Senate Bill 1947, which moved Illinois to an \"evidence-based model\" of education funding, taking into account each district's individual needs, as well as its local revenue sources, when appropriating state aid – prioritizing districts that are furthest from being fully funded. The new law created a scholarship plan that earmarked up to $75 million for scholarship tax credits. Lawmakers said those credits would go to low- and middle-income parents, impacting roughly 6,000 private school students whose families make less than $73,000 per year. The new law created the first revision in two decades of the way general state-aid dollars to schools were distributed, establishing a multifaceted procedure for determining need and setting a goal for \"adequacy\" of funding in each of the state's 852 school districts. The bill received praise from the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''Daily Herald'', and ''Chicago Sun-Times'', along with numerous civic organizations.\n\n\nRauner said that local governments should be allowed to pass . Additionally, Rauner said that the state should ban some political contributions by public unions, saying, \"government unions should not be allowed to influence the public officials they are lobbying, and sitting across the bargaining table from, through campaign donations and expenditures\".\n\nIn 2014, Rauner's election campaign was helped financially by , CEO of , a successful global investment firm, who made a rare and impassioned plea to the sold-out audience at the Economic Club of Chicago (ECC) in May 2013 to replace the Democrats at all levels of governance. He supported Rauner's campaign promises to \"cut spending and overhaul the state's pension system, impose term limits, and weaken public employee unions\". Griffin called for a show of financial support to Rauner that met with an increase in campaign donations representing tens of millions of dollars, or half the $65 million spent on Rauner's 2014 election campaign. Of this half, such money originated from Rauner himself along with \"nine other individuals, families, or companies they control\".\n\n\nRauner received media attention for his political stance on the minimum wage. Rauner favored either raising the national minimum wage so Illinois employers were on the same level as those in neighboring states, or unilaterally raising Illinois' minimum wage, but pairing the change with pro-business reforms to the state's tax code, workers compensation reform, and .\n\nRauner's position on the minimum wage changed significantly during his campaign. At a candidate forum on December 11, 2013, Rauner stated that he would favor reducing Illinois's minimum wage from $8.25 to the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The '''' also uncovered video of Rauner at a campaign event in September 2013, where he said that he was \"adamantly, adamantly against raising the minimum wage\", and audio of an interview with Rauner from January 10, 2014, when he said: \"I have said, on a number of occasions, that we could have a lower minimum wage or no minimum wage as part of increasing Illinois' competitiveness.\"\n\n\nRauner strongly opposed Governor Pat Quinn's proposal to make the 2011 temporary income tax increase permanent, instead calling for the Illinois' income tax rate to gradually be rolled back to 3 percent. On January 1, 2015, the income tax increase automatically decreased, with the personal income tax rate falling from 5 percent to 3.75 percent and the corporate tax rate from 7 percent to 5.25 percent.\n\nIn July 2014, Rauner called for expanding Illinois' sales tax to dozens of services, such as legal services, accounting services, and computer programming, which were not subject to the sales tax in Illinois. Rauner estimated the expanded sales tax would bring in an additional $600 million a year. Rauner's services tax proposal was harshly criticized by Quinn, who said it would fall hardest on low income people.\n\nRauner opposed a graduated income tax.\n\nRauner received a 92 percent approval from Taxpayers United for America, the first time a sitting Illinois governor received a score of more than 70 percent from that organization.\n\n\nRauner strongly favored term limits, and pledged to limit himself to no more than eight years as governor. He organized and funded a push to put a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on Illinois legislators on the November 2014 ballot, gathering 591,092 signatures. However, the term limits amendment was struck down in court as unconstitutional.\n\n\nDuring his 2014 campaign, Rauner called for \"billions\" of dollars per year in public spending on infrastructure, but declined to detail how he would pay for the spending.\n\nAlso during his campaign, Rauner declined to take a position on the controversial  and  projects advanced by Quinn. After taking office in 2015, he suspended the Illiana project, pending a cost-benefit review.\n\nIn February 2015, Rauner proposed raising highway funding and slashing transit funding, which he saw as inefficient spending.\n\n\nRauner stated that while he wanted laws and policies to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, he would not go beyond that due to constitutional concerns.\n\n\nRauner has a record of supporting . The Rauner family has donated \"thousands of dollars\" to , and prior to his 2014 campaign, the Rauner Family Foundation donated $510,000 to the 's Roger Baldwin Foundation.\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Rauner signed S.B. 1564 into law, which required doctors and pregnancy centers that refuse to perform abortions for religious or moral reasons to refer patients to places where they could have an abortion. The bill was passed on partisan lines, with no Republican legislators voting for the bill. Rauner's decision to sign the bill into law angered conservative groups. The same day, Rauner also signed a bill that extended insurance coverage for nearly all contraceptives. On August 5, Rauner was sued by a , a -based medical center, and a  physician, claiming that SB 1564 was unconstitutional. On December 20, 2016, a  Circuit Judge issued a preliminary injunction, which temporarily prohibited the State of Illinois from enforcing the law after it went into effect on January 1, 2017.\n\nAs a candidate in 2014, Rauner stated that he opposed the existing Illinois law that restricted abortion coverage under Medicaid and the state employee health plan. In April 2017, however, Rauner pledged to veto an abortion rights bill that would (a) remove those abortion coverage restrictions: and (b) repeal an Illinois law making abortion illegal if '''' were to be overturned. Despite his veto pledge, Rauner signed the abortion rights bill into law on September 28, 2017, earning him harsh criticism from conservative Republicans.\n\n\nIn 2018, Rauner called for the death penalty to be revived along with imposing on people convicted of killing police officers.\n\n\nOn August 12, 2016, Rauner vetoed a bill that would have automatically registered as a voter anyone in Illinois who sought a new or updated drivers license as well as other services, unless they chose to opt out. Rauner said that he supported automatic voter registration, but that he vetoed the bill because he was worried that \"the bill would inadvertently open the door to voter fraud and run afoul of federal election law\". On August 28, 2017, Rauner signed a revised version of the automatic voter registration bill.\n\n\nOn August 28, 2017, Rauner signed a bill into law that prohibited state and local police from arresting anyone solely due to their immigration status or due to federal detainers. Some Republicans criticized Rauner for his action, saying that the bill made Illinois a . On November 15, 2017, the  announced that a preliminary conclusion had been reached that Illinois was now a sanctuary jurisdiction in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1373 and issued a warning to state authorities on the issue. Subsequently, , there is still no evidence that Illinois responded stating that it was in compliance with the law. The deadline to do so was December 8, 2017.\n\n\nRauner supports . As a gubernatorial candidate in 2014, he said that he had no comment on same-sex marriage but would not change the law legalizing gay marriages. In 2015, Rauner signed legislation banning the use of  on minors. He also signed a bill making it easier for  people to change their s. He also marched in  and Chicago s. In 2018, Rauner officiated the wedding of a same-sex couple.\n\n\n\nOn June 20, 2016, Rauner confirmed that he would run for a second term; he formally announced his re-election campaign on October 23, 2017. In the Republican primary, Rauner faced State Representative , who ran against him from the political right. Rauner was endorsed by the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''The Daily Herald'', and the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', and by 37 elected officials from , part of which was represented by Ives. On March 20, 2018, Rauner narrowly won the Republican primary, with 52% of the vote; Ives received 48% of the vote. In the November general election, Rauner lost to Democratic nominee ; Pritzker received 55% of the vote while Rauner received 39%. It was the most lopsided margin in an Illinois gubernatorial race since 's bid for a second term in  and the lowest percentage of the vote received by a Republican candidate since .\n\n\n\n\nBefore being elected governor, Rauner resided in , with his wife, , and family; they have three children. He also has three children from his first marriage, to Elizabeth Konker Wessel, whom he married in 1980, separated from in 1990, and was legally divorced from in 1993.\n\nDuring Rauner's governorship, he and his family resided in the  in . They also own ranches in  and . Rauner is an .\n\nRauner's exact net worth is unclear, but has been estimated at being at least several hundred million dollars. During his campaign for governor he promised that he would accept only $1 in salary and no benefits from his office, including forgoing a pension and any reimbursement for travel expenses.\n\nAfter losing the 2018 election, Rauner moved to . By August 2020, he was registered to vote in Florida rather than Illinois.

Sposato came under criticism from the LGBTQ community for misusing the term \"identifying as.\" This arose when, amid  pandemic local media asked Chicago aldermen about their COVID vaccination status, leading Sposato to offer a response that quipped, \"You can identify as whatever you want these days, can't you? I identify as a vaccinated person.\"  responded to this by saying, \"This is part of a long pattern of people misconstruing the concept of gender identity as simply stating that a person is whatever they want to be – often just to win an argument or get some material benefit – instead of expressing a deep sense of one's own reality and living as a person's authentic self.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was first elected in 2010 as a  in the 49th district, defeating incumbent  , and was later elected to the redrawn 50th district in .\n\nIn 2018, McCann left the Republican Party and  as the nominee of the newly-founded Conservative Party. He ran as a more socially conservative alternative to incumbent Republican governor . On July 10, 2024, he was sentenced in federal court to 3 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty to fraudulent use of campaign funds, money laundering and tax evasion.\n\n\nSam McCann attended  and , although he never earned a bachelor's degree.\n\n\nStarting in 1993, McCann was the president of his own construction company.  Records from the Illinois  Secretary of State's Office show that \"the agency dissolved the corporate status of McCann Construction Services Inc. as of December 2013 for failure to file an annual report and pay an annual franchise tax. McCann Construction Co. was also dissolved as a corporation by the secretary of state on Nov. 14 for the same reasons.\"  As of May 20, 2015, McCann's two companies: McCann Construction and McCann Construction Services faced tax liens from the Internal Revenue Services totaling $185,000.\n\n\n\nMcCann was first elected in 2010, narrowly defeating incumbent Democrat . It was one of the most expensive and competitive legislative races in Illinois that year. In 2012, he was re-elected after a primary race against Gray Noll, and without Democratic opposition in the redrawn 50th district.\n\nDuring McCann’s 2016 run for re-election, he faced a primary challenger, Bryce Benton, a state trooper who was backed by Illinois governor ; Rauner reportedly spent more than $3 million on Benton’s behalf, after McCann voted with Democrats in the legislature to override Rauner’s veto of a union arbitration bill. McCann ultimately won re-nomination with 52.67 percent of the vote to Benton’s 47.33 percent. McCann then ran unopposed in the general election.\n\n\n\nMcCann did not run for re-election in 2018, instead forming the Conservative Party of Illinois in order to runO'Connor, John  ''Associated Press'', February 15. 2024. Retrieved February 22. 2024. United States Attorney's Office, February 16. 2024. Retrieved February 22. in the 2018 Illinois gubernatorial election as a third party candidate nominee. In an interview with Politico, McCann described himself as an \"independent conservative\" and stated that he was motivated to run to prevent \"two billionaires from Chicago\" from being the only general-election candidates. McCann’s campaign platform was perceived as being rooted in social issues such as abortion; McCann argued that economic issues, such as the state’s levels of debt, were equally important to his campaign. McCann also argued that he was more closely aligned with then-President  than was Rauner.\n\nIn order to qualify to appear on the ballot, McCann needed to collect at least 25,000 signatures; he ultimately received more than 65,000. McCann ultimately placed third in the election, with four percent of the vote, behind J.B. Pritzker and Bruce Rauner.\n\n\nIn early 2016, a complaint was filed with the Illinois State Board of Elections alleging that McCann had given himself too much money from his campaign fund for mileage reimbursements that were in excess of the amount that McCann actually traveled, and that McCann had also given himself money from the same fund for \"grouped expenditures\" which were not properly documented. The \"grouped expenditures\" totaled $46,719.  The total amount for the challenged mileage reimbursements and \"grouped expenditures\" that McCann personally received from his campaign fund was $85,019.65. After hearing from the complainant and McCann, the board voted unanimously to hold a public hearing.  A day before the public hearing was to take place in September 2016, the complaint was dropped, but the complainant, through his attorney, pledged to refile it and include more allegations.  In September 2017, McCann came under fire again when he used campaign funds to purchase an  for over $60,000 and a new engine on a personally owned vehicle.\n\nIn February 2021, McCann was indicted by the U.S. Attorney's Office on charges of fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion related to his alleged misuse of campaign money for personal expenses. The indictment alleges that from May 2015 to June 2020, McCann engaged in a scheme to convert more than $200,000 in contributions and donations made to his campaign committees to pay himself and make personal purchases, and that he concealed his fraud from donors, the public, the Illinois State Board of Elections and law enforcement authorities.\n\nOn February 15, 2024, near the end of his trial, McCann changed his plea to guilty on all the counts of corruption against him. On July 10, 2024, he was sentenced to 42 months in prison followed by 2 years of supervised parole and was ordered to pay $683,816.61 in restitution.\n\n\nMcCann's wife is named Vicki.

She previously served two terms as a member of the Dolton Village Board of Trustees from 2013 through 2021. Henyard won election as a trustee in 2013 and 2017, and election as mayor in 2021. She was appointed supervisor in 2022.\n\nAs mayor and supervisor, Henyard has become embroiled in scandals involving allegations of financial mismanagement, , , and other misconduct. She has been at odds with the majority of the village's Board of Trustees. In early 2024, the 's office began scrutinizing Henyard's activities as mayor and her  organization. The  (FBI) also interviewed witnesses and subpoenaed records related to Henyard's alleged corruption. Henyard is also under civil investigation by the , and is a defendant in a number of s.\n\n\nHenyard grew up in Dolton, and graduated from . She earned a degree in business administration from . Henyard is a lifelong resident of Dolton.\n\nIn 2011, Henyard got her start in government and politics by working on then-governor 's \"Put Illinois to Work\" initiative.\n\nHenyard regards , the former longtime , to have been her . She regards , the late longtime supervisor of Thornton Township, to have been another mentor of hers.\n\n\nHenyard was a village trustee of Dolton, having first won election in the 2013  election. Supporters dubbed Henyard the \"People's Trustee\". She was re-elected in 2017.\n\nHenyard became a sharp critic of Mayor Riley Rogers. She was one of only two trustees to vote against overturning Rogers's  on the city's budget appropriation for the 2018–19 fiscal year. With the board of trustees successfully overriding the veto in a 4–2 vote, ten village employees were immediately laid off from their positions. \n\nIn 2018, she joined several other village trustees in launching a legal challenge to block   championed by Rogers from appearing on the ballot. The challenge was unsuccessful. The separate ballot measures on whether to reduce the size of the board of trustees and whether to place term limits on board membership both failed before voters.\n\nAs a trustee, Henyard started the city's \"Block by Block\" program, which allowed people to purchase vacant houses for $5,000, with the aim of allowing the city to once again collect tax revenue from those properties.\n\nIn August 2019, CBS 2 Chicago () reported that a residence which Henyard owned as a , and for which she received  subsidies had a severe  problem, as well as issues with water leakage. In November 2019, the same channel reported that the residence's mold situation had become severe enough that it was deemed uninhabitable and its tenant was forced to move out, but that Henyard had continued to receive Section 8 Housing subsidies. Her tenant accused her of failing to remedy the mold problem, and media scrutiny raised more concerns over the prior inspection history of the property.\n\n\nIn October 2020, Henyard launched her mayoral candidacy. Henyard ran on a platform criticizing incumbent mayor Riley Rogers's tenure. Henyard defeated Rogers in a four-way primary for the  nomination. She defeated  candidate Ronnie Burge in the April general election, winning approximately 82% of the vote.\n\nHenyard ran with a slate that she dubbed the \"Dream Team\". From this slate, two of the three trustee candidates were elected, Kiana Belcher and incumbent Jason House, as was village clerk candidate Alison Key. Her relationship with these individuals later soured. By April 2022, roughly a year after the election, the three were joining most of the village board in pursuing legal action against Henyard.\n\n\n\nHenyard was sworn in as mayor on May 8, 2021, becoming the first female mayor of the village, as well as the youngest in its history, being 37 years old.\n\nIn February 2024, Fox 32 Chicago () reported that numerous individuals in Dolton had confirmed to them that they were interviewed by the  (FBI) as part of an probe into Henyard's activities as mayor. The '''' soon after reported that an unnamed law enforcement official had confirmed to them that an FBI investigation into Henyard existed.  The Dolton Board of Trustees' legislative counsel, Burt Odelson, noted in April 2024 that the village government was a defendant in almost forty active lawsuits related to Henyard's conduct.\n\nOn April 19 2024, the FBI entered the Dolton City Hall to serve subpoenas for records related to the alleged corruption by members of the town government. \n\n\nWithin the first half-year of her tenure Henyard faced criticism from trustees.   Areas of criticism have included her use of municipal funds; and a lack of . Within her first year as mayor, the village board filed a  against Henyard which alleged that she had . In response, she has accused select members of the village board of causing upheaval and locked trustees out of their offices, canceling board meetings. The trustees then held meetings without her presence and d her in October 2021.\n\nIn February 2024, the board of trustees adopted a resolution addressed to the , , , and the  calling for an investigation into Henyard. Henyard vetoed the resolution. Her veto was overridden on April 8.\n\nTrustees for the City of Dolton have claimed that the city is headed towards a multi-million dollar deficit as result of reckless spending under Mayor Henyard.\n\n\nNumerous village residents, employees, and business owners have accused Henyard of using her position to retaliate against perceived political opposition, including alleged use by Henyard of the village police force to harass businesses whose owners had not supported her and  campaign contributions from business owners.  She has also been accused of firing several village employees for political reasons.Multiple sources:\n*\n*  \n\nIn early 2024, Redeemed Christian Church of God Resurrection Power Assembly filed a lawsuit against Henyard and the Village of Dolton alleging that the village had discriminated against them. The suit asserts that the village did not act in accordance with its zoning codes when it prevented the church from renovating a building it had acquired.\n\n\nIn March 2024, after reviewing files obtained through a Freedom of Information request, NBC Chicago () made public that the  is investigating a matter against Henyard, the Village of Dolton, and Thornton Township in which Henyard's former assistant alleged to have been sexually assaulted by a village trustee and subsequently retaliated against by Henyard. The investigation stems from two separate complaints about the matter. Both complainants asked the Illinois Department of Human Rights to help them to receive back pay, front pay, attorney's fees, and punitive damages. Henyard has alleged that these allegations are false and are from \"disgruntled\" employees.\n\n\nBy 2022, Henyard faced allegations of spending village funds without proper approval from the board of trustees or the village clerk. Trustees and Henyard argued at council meetings over city spending. In January 2024, city trustee Brittney Norwood expressed worry that Dolton was headed towards  due to the spending, noting that it had $7 million in debt. Village trustees have expressed concern about the village's debt, and that it was not meeting its financial obligations.\n\nIn February 2024, the village board of trustees, in a 4–2 vote, overrode Henyard's veto of their budget for the 2024–25 fiscal year, which included budget cuts. Henyard alleged that the cuts in the budget would bankrupt Dolton. In February 2024, the village was warned by KS State Bank that thirteen vehicles used by the police department are at risk of . Henyard argued that the village board trustees had refused to permit payment on the vehicles, which Village Trustee Jason House refuted countering that such payments had been approved by the board months earlier.\n\n\nOne of Henyard's first actions after becoming mayor was hiring Robert Collins to serve as Dolton's police chief. Collins had previously served in the position, but had resigned the previous year. She retained Steven McCain as the city's fire chief. In October 2023, Henyard fired Collins. In early 2024, Collins filed a  lawsuit alleging that his dismissal had come without cause and without approval from the village board, and that it had been motivated as retribution for the mayor's perception of his wife and a number of his personal acquaintances as being political adversaries.\n\nIn October 2021, the board of trustees voted to require Henyard to make any hiring or firing of village employees subject to the board's . Village trustees have accused Henyard of disregarding this and continuing to make staffing changes without their advice and consent.\n\n\nIn 2021, the fatal shooting by a police officer brought civil unrest in Dolton and criticism of Henyard by  protesters.\n\n\nIn September 2023, Fox 32 Chicago published an investigative report on Henyard's use of a police security detail, noting that this practice cost Dolton citizens hundreds of thousands annually.\n\nCritics of Henyard on the board of trustees have characterized Henyard's redirection of police resources towards her own security detail as being to the detriment of public safety in Dolton. In October 2021, the board of trustees voted to attempt to require her to pay the city back for her police protection. In February 2024, ''Black Enterprise'' reported that Henyard's security detail had already cost the village approximately $1 million. In March 2024, Fox 32 Chicago reported on work records it received via a Freedom of Information Request which showed her security detail being paid for a substantial number of work hours and overtime hours, with one officer having previously been paid for 303 hours in a two-week period.\n\n\n\nIn early 2024, Samysha Williams, who had been a candidate in the 2023 Dolton village trustee elections, filed to sue Henyard and Henyard's campaign committee for libel and . In the same lawsuit, the individual alleged that she had been wrongfully terminated in 2022 from her job with the village while taking .\n\n\nIn April 2022, the Dolton Village Board added two  aimed at  Henyard to a ballot on June 28, 2022, the same time as primaries for the . The first question would have established a recall mechanism, and the second would have recalled Henyard. In June 2022, Judge Paul Karkula directed the  to disregard votes cast on the referenda. However the  granted a partial stay of the ruling, directing the clerk to tally ballots. \n\nBoth questions passed, with 56.5% of voters voting to establish the recall mechanism and 56.1% of voters voting to recall Henyard. Henyard said that these results were due to her supporters not voting due to the chaotic nature of the court cases. The Illinois Appellate Court ruled on October 6, 2022, that the referenda were illegal, and issued a permanent injunction against the certification of them.\n\n\n\nOn March 3, 2022, Henyard was appointed and sworn in as the supervisor of the , following the death of incumbent Frank Zuccarelli. She was appointed by the Thornton Township Board in a vote that took place close to a legal deadline for the board to fill the position, after which they would have ceded the appointment decision to a town hall-style meeting of township electors. Henyard was the last of nine nominations for the position. \n\nThornton Township is one of 29  in , and Dolton is one of 17 communities comprising the township. It is one of the largest townships in Illinois, and employs more than 170 individuals, some full-time and others part-time. It contains several of the state's most impoverished communities. Henyard is the youngest person, the first woman, and the first African American supervisor of Thornton Township.\n\n\nHenyard has alleged that she inherited a problematic financial situation in the township. When she took office, allegedly the township's payrolls were compensating \"ghost employees\" who did little work and the township had a $5 million budget deficit. She has asserted that she has addressed that deficit.\n\n\nHenyard has continued the Zuccarelli Assistance Program (ZAP), renaming it the Henyard Assistance Program (HAP). This program gives teenagers above the age of sixteen summer jobs mowing the lawns of senior citizens.\n\nIn February 2024, with Henyard's backing, the township board earmarked $1 million for assistance to those behind on their rents and mortgages through the township's general assistance department. Henyard described the program as providing a maximum of $3,000 in aid to individuals at least two months behind on such payments, but not those already in the process of being evicted. Sources of funding for the program were not explicitly identified. \n\nIn both April 2023 and March 2024, Henyard and the township board presented voters with ballot referendums on whether create a 0.15% township property tax that would have been earmarked for mental health services. It was estimated that the tax would generate $3 million annually. In April 2023, voters rejected the proposal by a vote of 51% to 49%. Ahead of the March 2024 vote,  mayors from eleven out of the seventeen municipalities in the township co-signed an open letter urging for residents to vote against the referendum. The mayors cited what they say was a lack of details from Henyard on how the funds would be spent. In that vote, voters again rejected the proposal, this time by a double-digit margin.\n\n\n\nHenyard's annual salary as supervisor is $224,000, equal to her predecessor's since 2017. At Henyard's urging, in December 2023 the township adopted a resolution that will result in a future 90% decrease to the supervisor's salary. This decrease is only to come into effect for the next supervisor, meaning that the supervisor salary will remain the same as long as Henyard's tenure continues. While Henyard will retain a salary $224,000 so long as she, as the incumbent, continues to hold the office of township supervisor, any successor will be paid $22,400 per year for the same position.  Similar salary decreases were passed for future township trustees, retaining current salaries for incumbents, so long as they continue to hold office.\n\nMunicipal attorney Burt Odelson, who stands in political opposition to Henyard, called the move, \"so illegal in so many ways\" and \"violates so many tenets of the law.\" Odelson called it, \"maybe the worst attempt to try to dissuade people from running [for office as challengers]\". He argued that  requires salaries to be \"identity blind\", meaning that they cannot change based upon who holds the office.\n\n\nIn August 2023, Henyard was accused of having locked the township assessor, a political adversary, out of the assessor's own office in an apparent act of retaliation. In late-February 2024, reporters were barred from attending a public township Black History Month event, being told that they would need to sign a  in order to be granted admission.\n\nIn 2024, a lawsuit was filed against Henyard and the township by a former township employee alleging that they had faced retribution for their refusal to compile a document for Henyard detailing \"dirt\" on township employees and their decision to take a  which they were entitled to under the . The plaintiff alleges that, after the end of her leave, she was refused entry into the township building and forced to complete her work in her car. The plaintiff alleges that her employment was terminated after complaining about six weeks of pay she had not received.\n\n\nHenyard founded Tiffany Henyard Cares, a charitable  whose stated mission is to assist individuals with . CARES is a  for \"Cancer and Remission Empowering Survivors\". Henyard's nonprofit has received significant promotion on her government websites and government  accounts. Several officers of the organization also worked for the city government.\n\nIn May 2023, an investigative report by Fox 32 Chicago made allegations of misconduct regarding municipal government interaction with the foundation. The report noted that thousands of taxpayer dollars had been spent on a group bicycle ride to the state capitol in  to support a bill related to breast cancer, despite the fact that the state legislature was not in session at the time and that the cited bill was never formally filed. A January 2024 investigation by WGN-TV's investigative journalism team reported that the township spent $10,248 on hotels that were on the route of a 2022 protest traveling between Dolton and  that was sponsored by the nonprofit, and there have been instances where township trustees were requested to approve large sums of funding to be directed to the charity.\n\nIn January 2024, it was reported that the nonprofit had not been filing the required basic financial reports that charities and non-profits are required to. After the charity failed to meet the February 16 deadline to do so, the Illinois Attorney General's Office ordered it to cease soliciting donations, and threatened to take action to recover money that had been paid to its board members and staff. The Illinois Attorney General's Office also noted that the nonprofit is not in good standing nor registered with the state.\n\nIn March 2024, a representative of the nonprofit responded to the Illinois Attorney General's Office, but provided an incomplete filings that lacked key records on its finances. The incomplete filing illustrated that nearly all of the nonprofit's funding came from township and village taxpayer money.\n\nAs of March of 2024 Mayor Henyard has attempted to dissociate herself from the foundation, in stark contrast to the time she spent in 2022 promoting the foundation and raising money for it, and her close personal and professional ties to the foundation’s leadership. She is also on record vetoing calls from her own board for an outside investigation into her misuse of village funds, which has allegedly put the village in the position of seeing a surplus of $5.6  million become a deficit of $3.6 million.  \n\n\nHenyard is a single mother.\n\nHenyard previously owned a restaurant named \"Good Burger\", originally located in  and then on the campus of .\n\nHenyard faced charges of criminal trespass to vehicles following an arrest in 2016, according to Chicago Police records. \n\n\nAt a local \"Martin Luther King Jr. Business Brunch\" in 2024, Henyard received the \"Martin Luther King Service Award\".\n\n\n\n;2013 Dolton village trustee\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;2019 Dolton village trustee\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;2021 Dolton mayoral\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was a longtime  and the head of the  until  when he ran unsuccessfully for  on the  ticket. He subsequently ran again in  on the  ticket. He was a prominent opponent of  and the ''de facto'' leader of the so-called  that opposed and blocked many of Washington's measures.\n\nAfter his electoral career ended, he resumed his law practice at The Vrdolyak Law Group. It consists of 20 attorneys. Vrdolyak's three sons are partners in the firm.\n\n\nVrdolyak, born to Croatian immigrant parents, entered a Catholic seminary at age 13, but decided against joining the priesthood. He graduated from  in Chicago, then from  in . He received his J.D. degree from the  in 1963 and began a legal career in private practice, specializing in  cases.\n\nVrdolyak's brother, Victor Vrdolyak (1933-1992), would also serve as a Chicago alderman (being elected in 1987 to succeed Edward on the city council).\n\n\nIn 1968, he was elected as Democratic Committeeman from Chicago's 10th Ward in the  and  areas; a position he held until 1988. In 1971, he was elected alderman, and, after defeating Republican Melvin Simonovich, he served as President of the City Council from 1977 to 1983. Vrdolyak earned the nickname \"Fast Eddie\" because of his skill in back-room deal-making. In 1979, he managed the re-election campaign of Mayor . In a colossal upset, Bilandic narrowly lost to maverick . Despite the fact that Byrne then stripped Vrdolyak of all powers except his aldermanic seat, he became Byrne's chief ally against both independent and Regular Democrats, becoming her floor leader in the Council. In 1982, with Byrne's support, he was elected Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee, ousting County Board President .\n\nHe is most noted for leading the opposition in the City Council to Mayor  from 1983 to 1987. After beating Mayor Byrne and  in the Democratic Primary, Washington won the general election by 47,549 votes. A solid majority of  (27 Regular Democrats and two independents) opposed Washington (21 aldermen supported the mayor). Vrdolyak and 14th Ward Alderman  led the opposition group. The Vrdolyak 29 rejected mayoral appointments and appropriations, but could not override the mayor's veto. The resulting political deadlock was labeled \"\".\n\nIn 1986, a federal lawsuit forced the redrawing of some aldermanic wards, and special elections in some, but not all, of the redrawn wards. Members of the Vrdolyak 29 were incumbents in all seven of the wards going to the polls. Four of them did not seek reelection, including three who sought seats on the county board. Two of the three attempting to retain their seats were reelected in the first round, but a third, Alderman Brady, lost six weeks later in a run-off; the council was split 25-25, creating a tie which the mayor could break. At this point, several of the Vrdolyak 29 began to support Washington, giving him a supportive council. In 1987, Vrdolyak resigned as county Democratic chairman, and ran for mayor as the  nominee, defeating a candidate backed by Washington in the primary. He was defeated by Washington, who got 53% of the vote to Vrdolyak's 42%.\n\nWashington's second term began more smoothly, but he unexpectedly died in November 1987 and Vrdolyak's political clout waned. In light of these factors, as well as his growing unpopularity among Democrats, Vrdolyak joined the  in September 1987. , Vrdolyak was the Republican nominee for Clerk of the . He received 41% of the vote; Democrat  (daughter of Alderman and former US Representative ) won with 59%. In 1989, Vrdolyak again ran for mayor, in a special election for the last half of Washington's term; he won the Republican primary as a write-in candidate. The general election was won by Democrat . Vrdolyak managed less than 4% of the vote, effectively ending his political career.\n\nAfter his final electoral defeat, Vrdolyak returned to his law practice. He hosted a popular talk radio show from 1993 to 1996, first on  radio (890&nbsp;AM) and then on  Radio (1160&nbsp;AM). He also maintained a strong behind-the-scenes presence in Chicago area politics. He became best known for his influence in the appointment and election of Cook County Circuit Court judges. Illinois Supreme Court Justice Charles Freeman confirmed that at least two judges he appointed to the bench were recommended by Vrdolyak. This would cause problems for Vrdolyak as he was implicated in the case of former Cook County Circuit Court Judge George J.W. Smith, who pled guilty to federal charges of illegally structuring cash withdrawals to avoid tax penalties. Prosecutors claimed the transactions were in furtherance of an alleged bribe paid to a \"go-between\" in order to secure Smith's appointment. Smith was reportedly appointed by Freeman based on Vrdolyak's recommendation, leading to speculation that Vrdolyak was the alleged \"go-between\". The investigation did not result in charges of wrongdoing against Vrdolyak, nor in bribery charges against Smith or any other party.\n\nVrdolyak was also a key adviser to , former Town President of the Chicago suburb of . The Vrdolyak Law Group received millions of dollars in legal work from the town during the administrations of Loren-Maltese and her successor, Ramiro González. Maltese was convicted of corruption in 2002 and González was defeated in the 2005 election. While Vrdolyak was not charged in the Loren-Maltese investigation, his close alliance with the once-imprisoned former Town President was a major issue in the 2005 election. During the campaign, Dominick criticized what he called Vrdolyak's excessive legal bills, and removed Vrdolyak's firm as the town's legal counsel after taking office. However,  reported that the new town attorney, Michael Del Galdo, billed the town over $2 million in 2006more than twice the average billings when Vrdolyak's firm held the contract.\n\nIn 2005, Vrdolyak agreed to a 30-day suspension of his law license for allegedly double-billing clients he represented in sexual harassment cases.\n\n\nOn May 10, 2007, Vrdolyak was indicted by a federal  on charges of bribery, mail fraud and wire fraud. Prosecutors later added additional wire fraud charges, and the final indictment included a total of eight counts. The case centered on property that was sold by the . The key witness against Vrdolyak was to be Stuart Levine, a partner in the alleged scheme. Prosecutors charged that Vrdolyak and Levine devised a scheme to use Levine's position on the school's board to steer the $15 million sale of a school building to Smithfield Properties - a developer with ties to Vrdolyak. It was alleged that the two arranged a $1.5 million  from Smithfield to Vrdolyak in return for Levine's support.\n\nLevine, a close friend and political ally of Vrdolyak, was indicted in 2005 for using his positions on the Illinois Teachers Retirement System board and the Illinois Health Facilities board to obtain kickbacks. Levine pleaded guilty in late 2006 and agreed to testify in several corruption cases as a condition of his plea agreement. Prosecutors dropped 22 felony charges in return for his cooperation. Prosecutors have indicated that Levine wore a recording device while discussing some of the alleged schemes. Political insiders expressed surprise at the idea that Vrdolyak would be caught on tape. A long-time power broker and target of investigations, the notoriously careful Vrdolyak has been quoted as saying that he \"talk[s] to everyone like they're wearing a wire, even my wife\". Chicago alderman  noted that Vrdolyak was always careful when talking on the phone, once telling Stone to \"always talk like the government was on the phone with you\".\n\nVrdolyak initially pleaded not guilty to all charges. Vrdolyak's attorney, Michael Monico, questioned Levine's \"credibility, reliability and truthfulness\", noting that he agreed to testify under \"immense pressure\" from prosecutors. Levine also testified at the 2008 trial of , another powerbroker in Illinois politics. He told the jury that he funneled payoffs for clients who wanted Chicago city contracts through Vrdolyak, including some alleged schemes for which Vrdolyak has not been charged. Monico called Levine's statements in regards to Vrdolyak \"absolutely false\" and said that he had never heard them before. Daily Herald, April 4, 2008\n\nThe trial was set for November 3, 2008. That day, however, an agreement was reached in which prosecutors dropped several of the charges and Vrdolyak pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.  Chicago Sun-Times, November 3, 2008 The plea agreement stated that Vrdolyak was not cooperating with other investigations, and prosecutors recommended a sentence of 41 months in prison. However, on February 26, 2009, United States District Judge  sentenced Vrdolyak to five years of , a $50,000  and 2,500 hours of . On January 29, 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the probation sentence on appeal by the prosecution and ordered a resentencing by a different judge. On October 15, 2010 Vrdolyak was sentenced to 10 months in prison. Vrdolyak served his sentence at the  in .  He was released from prison on November 17, 2011.\n\nOn November 15, 2016, Vrdolyak was indicted for income tax evasion. He pled guilty on March 4, 2019. Vrdolyak was sentenced to eighteen months in prison for the scheme. Judge  ordered Vrdolyak to report to  by November 30, 2021 to complete his eighteen month sentence.

Plummer represents the 54th District, which is located on the Illinois side of  and includes all or portions of , , , , , , , and  counties. He was the  Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor, which he narrowly lost.\n\nAs of November 26, 2022, Jason Plummer is a member of the  representing Republicans residing in .\n\n\nPlummer's family resided in  at his birth and moved to . Plummer lived in Glen Carbon and , where he graduated from Edwardsville High School, before attending and graduating from the  with a B.S. in finance. At the University of Illinois, Plummer was active in several organizations including the  Fighting Illini Battalion. After college, he interned at  in . He commissioned as an  in the s after college.\n\n\nAt age 25, Plummer was elected Chairman of the  Republican Party, the minority party in a historic stronghold for the . The youngest party chairman in Illinois at the time, he was elected on a platform of combating local corruption and rebuilding the local GOP in one of the largest counties in the state by population. Since Plummer's election, the Madison County Republican Party has made significant gains, winning numerous county-wide offices and taking majority control of the county board for the first time in history.\n\nDuring the , Plummer ran to be a delegate to the  from  for the  of former Governor .\n\nPlummer was the Republican nominee for  in 2010. Plummer won the primary and was paired with the winner of the Republican gubernatorial primary, State Senator Bill Brady, for the general election. The Brady/Plummer ticket narrowly lost to incumbent Illinois Governor Pat Quinn in . Plummer was the campaign's voice on economic issues in an election heavily centered on the economy and government corruption issues.\n\n\nPlummer was first elected to the Illinois Senate . He defeated three others in the primary election, garnering over 57% of the total vote in the four-way race. In the general election he carried all eight counties of the district and defeated his opponent with over 70% of the vote, becoming the first Republican State Senator from Madison County in five decades.\n\n\nIn January 2021, Plummer was named Assistant Republican Leader on the Illinois Senate Republican Leadership Team for the 102nd Illinois General Assembly. Plummer was one of the youngest senators ever appointed to leadership and is the only senator from Southern Illinois serving in Senate leadership during the 102nd Illinois General Assembly.\n\nDuring the 102nd  (2021-2023), Plummer serves on the following committees: Executive Appointments (Minority Spokesperson); Financial Institutions (Minority Spokesperson); Behavioral and Mental Health; Commerce; Environment and Conservation; Health; Labor; Subcommittee on Children & Family; Sub. on Managed Care Organizations; Redistricting; Redistricting- South Cook County; Redistricting- Southern Illinois (Sub-Minority Spokesperson); Redistricting- Southwestern IL (Sub-Minority Spokesperson).\n\n\nDuring the 101st Illinois General Assembly (2019-2021), Plummer served on the following committees: Appropriations I, Appropriations II, Committee of the Whole, Environment and Conservation, Executive Appointments, Financial Institutions, and Public Health.\n\nIn January 2021, Plummer was an outspoken critic of Illinois House Bill 3653, appearing on Chicago TV and in print to try to defeat the bill he claimed would endanger Illinois families and communities. Though opposed by Plummer, numerous other legislators, the law enforcement community, and other groups, the controversial bill passed the Illinois Senate and the Illinois House, garnering the minimum number of votes needed to pass.\n\nIn April 2020, Plummer called on the federal government to not \"bail out\" Illinois, calling it the \"most corrupt\" state in the country while highlighting investigations and convictions of lawmakers in the state. “Don't let it happen. Federal dollars should not prop up Illinois’ failed system,” he added. His comments came after it became public that the Illinois Senate Democrat Caucus had sent a letter to Washington, DC lawmakers requesting over $41 Billion in federal funds for Illinois. “The message from Illinois’ elected leaders is crystal clear: no humility, no regrets, no acknowledgment of failures, and no strings attached. American Taxpayers  bail us out!” Plummer wrote in an op-ed, adding “Why should the fiscally prudent people of Wyoming, Missouri or elsewhere be responsible for the failed policies of Illinois?”. His op-ed appeared in national media and Plummer discussed the issue on Fox News Channel.\n\nIn December 2019, Plummer clashed with then Republican Caucus Leader, and Plummer's former 2010 running mate, Senator Bill Brady, over ethics issues. In the fall of 2019, the Illinois House and Senate established a new ethics committee to study and recommend tougher ethical laws that might prevent abuses of power, corruption, or inside dealing within the legislature. Plummer, who originally sought a position on the committee, received an appointment that he then declined to accept. Communications traded between Brady and Plummer eventually came out that showed Plummer refused the appointment because he claimed Brady offered him the appointment to the commission on the condition that Plummer would not file legislation to ban lawmakers' ability to profit on gambling, a bill supported by other senators but that would have impacted Brady personally. According to media reports that later came out, Plummer had been openly pressuring Brady to pursue more stringent ethical reforms in private Senate Republican meetings, but the Minority Leader instead opted to embrace \"low-hanging fruit” offered by Democrats. Plummer, a first term senator at the time, received favorable commentary from other legislators and the media for his actions and subsequently filed a package of bills on topics relating to legislators' involvement in gambling and recreational marijuana investments, pay-to-play and lobbying activities, campaign spending activities, and other ethics-related topics.\n\nOn the issue of taxes, Plummer supports lowering the state income tax. In early 2019, he cosponsored a proposal (Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 12) which would call for a new amendment to the Illinois state constitution that would require a two-thirds supermajority in both houses of the legislature for any measure that raises taxes or state fees.\n\nIn 2019, Plummer sponsored legislation (HB 2308) that allowed courts to forbid contact between defendants in custody and victims. The legislation passed the legislature and was signed into law by Governor  in July 2019. Both the Illinois Sheriffs Association and Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police backed the bill. Related legislation (HB 2309) also sponsored by Plummer and signed into law enacted new rules relating to emergency stalking no contact orders, civil no contact orders, and emergency orders of protection whereby the orders do not become publicly availably information until they have been served on the respondent. Another bill sponsored by Plummer, HB 3462, allows Illinois schools to include hunting safety classes as part of the curriculum. Plummer cited expanded hunting safety as one of his chief concerns when sponsoring the bill. The legislation was signed into law and became effective immediately.\n\nPlummer sponsored two resolutions in the 101st Illinois General Assembly, one, SR 0451, addressed economic development in downstate Illinois and passed in the Senate and the House and another, SJR 0026, which passed the Senate 55-0 but failed to be brought to a vote in the Illinois House of Representatives. SJR 0026 would have rescinded Illinois' 1862 ratification of the Corwin Amendment to the United States Constitution, which aimed to end the  by preventing federal interference in the institution of slavery. Plummer worked with several historians to address this complicated topic and sought and received support from numerous members of the .\n\nDuring the 101st Illinois General Assembly Plummer sponsored multiple bills focused on corruption and ethics, government budgets, taxes and job creation, and enhanced criminal penalties for crimes relating to human trafficking, attacks on law enforcement personnel, drug production and distribution, and animal cruelty.\n\nBills sponsored by Plummer that were signed into law include bills relating to: enhanced protections for the developmentally disabled, prioritized funding for educators in rural and economically disadvantaged school districts, establishing a system to regularly investigate and review the necessity of new state regulations over previously unregulated professions or occupations, creating an electronic process involving audio and video transmission by which law enforcement may receive a search warrant from a judge, eliminating the statute of limitations on aggravated child pornography and criminal sexual abuse, creating a process by which the victim of a crime may confidentially register and provide statements to the Prison Review Board for parole and clemency hearings, lessening regulations and licensing fees on certain agricultural equipment, training requirements for charter school board members, increasing penalties on those who cause great bodily harm while driving and using an electronic communication device, forcing certain insurance policy plans to provide certain coverages for tick-borne diseases, amending the Environmental Protection Act to allow uncontaminated plastics that are returned to the economic mainstream via other forms to be considered recycled and not waste, the creation of the Veterans' Service-Related Ailments Task Force to review and make recommendations regarding veterans' service-related ailments, amending the vehicle code to ease certain restrictions and rules on volunteer fire departments, ease certain restrictions on the automotive and recycling industries, a re-write of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in Illinois to better conform with the federal UCMJ, the approval of a license plate from the Illinois Secretary of State intended to honor Illinois residents who served in the military during the Cold War, multiple bills and resolutions honoring individuals and landmarks, and banning the posting of private communications which include compromising images of a person online, including a process to force the take down of such images and to hold a person who posts such images liable for damages to the victim.\n\n\nPlummer serves as vice president of R.P. Lumber, one of the largest family-owned hardware, home center, and building material companies in the U.S. The company was founded by Plummer's parents, Robert and Donna, former school teachers and coaches, in 1977 and grew from one retail location to 75 locations across Illinois, Missouri, Wyoming, and Iowa.

In 2019, Manar along with 39th District Representative  filed SB667, which would cap insulin costs at $100 a month for diabetic patients in the State of Illinois.

In 2015, an investor in RED sued the company, alleging mismanagement by Casten.

Using the 2020 census, there would have been 138 more Representatives than present, each representing a district roughly the population of Wyoming.\n* The Senate Reform constitutional amendment would add 12 new Senators elected at-large by ranked-choice voting from the entire electorate (including non-states such as District of Columbia). It would also add 12 presidential electors who would be pledged to vote according to the national popular vote.\n* The Restoring Judicial Separation of Powers Act would restructure the federal courts and appeals process to make it more difficult for one party to game the system by stacking the courts.\n\n\nCasten voted for a resolution in support of Israel following the . \n\nIn March 2024, Casten criticized Israeli Prime Minister  for the \"utter disregard for Palestinian lives\".\n\t\n\nOn July 19, 2024, Casten called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the .\n\n\nFor the :\n* \n** \n** \n** \n* \n\n\n*\n* \n* House Pro-Choice Caucus\n* Sustainable Investment Caucus (co-chair)\n* New Democrat Coalition's Climate Change Task Force (Vice-Chair)\n* Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (Vice-Chair)\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasten and his wife, Kara, live in .\n\nOn June 13, 2022, Casten's daughter Gwen died suddenly at the age of 17 from .

Ammons' itemized campaign contributions amounted to $16,000 compared to Rosenberg's $185,000.\n\nIn April 2015, Ammons formally announced that she was considering a run for Congress in Illinois' 13th Congressional District, but ultimately decided not to.\n\nAmmons, while unopposed for reelection, was one of eight candidates endorsed by  during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nThe 103rd district primarily encompasses the Champaign-Urbana community, including the  campus. Ammons is also an active member of the  and in early 2023 was named Joint Chair of the caucus.\n\n\nAs of 2022, Ammons serves on the following committees and subcommittees:\n*Appropriations - Higher Education Committee\n*Counties & Townships Committee\n*Economic Opportunity & Equity Committee\n*Energy & Environment Committee\n*Ethics & Elections Committee\n*Higher Education Committee\n*Small Business, Tech Innovation, and Entrepreneurship Committee(Chairperson)\n*Campaign Finance Subcommittee\n\n\nBills of which Ammons is listed as the Primary Sponsor and which have gone on to become law in  include HB3783, which amends the Illinois Environmental Protection Act to require the  to certify that all workers who install  surface impoundments have completed specified trainings preparing them to do so, and HB1063, which repealed a statute that had created the criminal offense of transmitting .\n\n\nDuring Ammons' 2014 campaign for the Illinois House of Representatives, Carol Ammons claimed to have graduated from Walsingham University in London, UK. Critics and local media pointed out that Walsingham is considered to be a pay-for-play, \"diploma mill\" and is not included on any credentialed lists of British government institutions of higher learning. Critics called on Ammons to drop out of the race due to the claim and related controversy.\n\nIn 2015, upon Carol Ammons' election to the Illinois House of Representatives and prior to her taking office, it was announced that Ammons' husband, Aaron Ammons, was pardoned by the outgoing governor of Illinois for crimes relating to heroin possession and other charges. The pardon allowed Aaron Ammons to apply for and be granted Carol Ammons' seat on the Urbana City Council, which she was vacating for her State Rep seat.\n\nIn 2020, Carol Ammons was investigated, but never arrested or charged for the theft of a Coach purse from a non-profit resale shop where she shopped regularly and bought hundreds of items.\n\nIn 2020, Carol Ammons was elected as Chairwoman of the Democratic Party for Champaign County.\n\nIn early 2023, Ammons applied for the Illinois Senate seat for the 52nd District that had been vacated by the untimely death of Senator Scott Bennett. Local Democratic leaders Mike Ingram and Cari West chose Paul Faraci, Bennett's former best friend to fill the seat. In the lead up to the appointment, Carol Ammons supporters and husband Aaron Ammons. along with many Democrats who disagreed with the process, were very vocal in their criticisms of the process. Several members of the Champaign County Democrats and the family of the late Scott Bennett ultimately made public statements refuting Carol and Aaron Ammons’ statements to the media and sharing disappointment in the Ammons’ actions around the time of Bennett’s death and during the posthumous appointment of a replacement to Bennett’s seat. Carol Ammons appeared as a guest on Aaron Ammons’ WEFT radio show a month after the appointment to call the process a “public lynching” and stated that she had “selflessly sought the Bennett seat,” regardless.\n\n\nAmmons currently resides in  with her husband, Aaron Ammons. Aaron Ammons is currently serving as the County Clerk for Champaign County, Illinois. Carol and Aarons' daughter, Titianna, served on the Champaign County Board until her resignation in 2021. Titianna Ammons received death threats during her campaign for County Board.\n\nIn the , Ammons served as a  from Illinois.\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* at the Illinois General Assembly\n\n* constituency site\n* at \n* at Illinois House Democrats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Walsh had unsuccessfully campaigned for Congress in 1996 and the  in 1998, but was elected to the U.S. House in 2010, defeating three-term incumbent . Though he received little Republican Party support in his bid against Bean, he was popular with the . In the 1990s, he identified as a , but he later became a  and a Tea Party activist.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, Walsh was criticized for his often personal attacks against members of the  and, specifically, President . He accused the president of abandoning the  and bankrupting the country. Walsh maintained a no-compromise approach to legislating that included rejecting any tax increases. He consistently voted against raising the  and authored a  to the . Walsh rejected the  and supported tougher . Later, during his presidential campaign, Walsh expressed regret for some of the comments and stances he made during his time in Congress.\n\nAs a result of  following the , Walsh's district was redrawn by the Democratic-controlled  in 2012. While he initially planned to run in the newly drawn 14th district against fellow Republican Representative , he eventually decided to run in the remapped 8th district against Democratic candidate . Walsh was defeated by Duckworth in the general election on November 6, 2012. After leaving office, Walsh began hosting a talk radio show. Though initially a strong supporter of , Walsh became increasingly critical of the president and, on August 25, 2019, he announced  in opposition to Trump. He dropped out of the race on February 7, 2020, after a poor showing in , and subsequently left the party. He later endorsed and voted for Democratic nominee , who won the election.\n\n\nWalsh was born and raised in the Chicago suburb of , the fifth of nine children of Susan (Stanley) and Charles Melville Walsh, a real estate mortgage banker who had an appraisal business. He graduated from  in 1980, where he was the student body president and active in sports. He attended  then earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from the  in 1985. In the mid-1980s, he embarked on an acting career, taking lessons in stage, theater and television at The  in New York City and Los Angeles. He completed a  at the 's  in 1991.\n\n\nAs a social worker, Walsh worked with the Jobs for Youth program in the inner-city Chicago area, teaching high school dropouts basic academic and job skills. He later taught American government and American history at  and the .\n\nWalsh ran the Daniel Murphy Scholarship Fund, a Chicago-based, privately funded program which grants scholarships to low-income students to attend private high schools. He raised funds for two organizations advocating : the American Education Reform Council, and the . In addition, Walsh raised nearly $1&nbsp;million over a five-year period for the Fabretto Children's Foundation, an international charity which uses education and micro-enterprise to alleviate poverty among Nicaraguan children.\n\nWalsh also worked on state and local government policy issues for , a  free-market  based in Chicago. He helped launch conservative organizations that seek to limit government and elect fiscal conservatives to state legislatures such as the Legislative Education Action Drive and the . He also did consulting work with the United Republican Fund, an Illinois  helping to elect Republican state legislators.\n\nHe has raised  for a living, according to the '''', with his campaign website indicating that he worked for Ravenswood Advisors, a Chicago   group which raised early-stage  for new and small businesses. It was reported that Walsh earned $30,000 to $40,000 a year in the past. In 2010, he had a negative net worth of $317,498 according to .\n\n\n\n\nWalsh won the Republican nomination for  and faced longtime  liberal incumbent , who was 87 years old, in the general election. Walsh campaigned by riding his bicycle through the district. He engaged in self-admitted \"outrageous\" stunts during the campaign which included paying the doorman at Yates's Chicago apartment building $1,000 for being the first person to spot Yates in his district, and throwing a birthday party for Yates that included a cake decorated with 87 candles. Walsh denied he was trying to play the \"age card\". Yates responded that his own age was not a factor, and that Walsh was too young and inexperienced for the job. Yates also commented that the district was too liberal for Walsh, and tried to tie Walsh to the conservative Speaker of the House, . In response, Walsh distanced himself from Gingrich and said he considered himself a \"moderate Republican;\" he also ran as a  candidate in the liberal-leaning district, and described himself as \"the most gay friendly Republican around\". Yates defeated Walsh 63–37%.\n\n\nIn 1998, Walsh challenged incumbent Democrat  for the 58th district seat in the , which represents the Chicago North Shore suburbs of  and . Walsh again ran as  on abortion. He drove a yellow school bus throughout the district during his campaign to focus attention on the issue of public school funding. He criticized Schoenberg for voting in favor of Republican Governor 's school-funding reform bill that would have increased state income taxes but given property tax relief to North Shore homeowners. Walsh lost to Schoenberg, 62%–38%.\n\n\n\n;2010\n\nOn September 28, 2009, Walsh launched an  to run for the  in the . The district included parts of the northwest Chicago suburbs, such as , , , , , , ,  and Walsh's home in . It had long been reckoned as the most Republican district in the Chicago area, and by some measures in all of Illinois. However, in 2004, Democrat  had ousted 36-year Republican incumbent  in a substantial upset, ending seventy years of Republican control.\n\nIn February 2010, Walsh won the Republican primary election, taking about 34 percent of the vote in a six-person field and moving into the district from  in April. The Republican establishment refused to put much stock into the district with  member Tom Erickson, saying, \"In the primary, we had really liked Dirk Beveridge or Maria Rodriguez. Those are the two candidates who we thought really had the potential to make this a very competitive race.\" Walsh's campaign responded that the GOP establishment was \"a bit tone deaf when it comes to independent, conservative reform candidates\".\n\nWalsh then advanced to face Bean in the general election. In 2006, Bean had been re-elected with 51 percent and in 2008 with 60 percent of the vote. Bean was endorsed by the '''', the '''', '''', and the ''''.\n\nWalsh criticized Bean for her 2010 votes in favor of the  and against the  that would have prohibited the use of federal funds to cover any part of the cost of any health plan that included coverage of abortion. He described himself as a  conservative activist and obtained endorsements from two Tea Party organizations, conservative radio talk show host , and many others.\n\nThe national Democratic and Republican parties did not compete or spend any money in the district, and the state GOP did not help Walsh. As a result, during the 2010 election cycle, Walsh's campaign raised only one-quarter as much as Bean's. He spent about $603,000 and ended the campaign about $362,000 in debt according to campaign finance reports, (with much of the debt due to post election ballot counting of the close race). As late as October, '''' forecast that Bean had an 88 percent chance at winning re-election. Even  had the election as \"Safe Democratic\". Despite the lack of funding and his long-shot status, Walsh narrowly defeated Bean by a margin of 0.1% or 291 votes. The race was not called until two weeks after Election Day when s were counted. It appeared that  candidate Bill Scheurer was a factor in the race; he tallied 6,400 votes, far more than Walsh's margin of victory.\n\n;2012\n\nDuring the 2011 redrawing of Illinois' election districts by the Democratic-controlled state legislature, Walsh's home, along with most of the  portion of his old district, was drawn into the 14th district, represented by fellow Republican . The 8th was reconfigured to favor a Democratic candidate. Walsh and nine other Republican Illinois Representatives filed a lawsuit alleging that the new borders discriminated against Republican and Latino voters. On September 21, Walsh announced that if the new district lines were upheld in federal court, he would run for election in the then-heavily Republican 14th district against Hultgren.\n\nIn late July 2011, Walsh was endorsed by the  to run against Hultgren. However, after several ethics issues regarding Walsh emerged, (such as charges of failing to pay child support, and driving on a suspended license), the Club for Growth distanced itself from Walsh, stating that it would wait until more facts were known before making a decision. In November 2011, Walsh was cited by the  Action committee for his \"unwavering support of the family.\"\n\nIn December 2011, Walsh decided to run in the redrawn 8th district instead, where he would likely face Democratic candidate , a former assistant secretary of the , in what posed a tough race for Walsh. In January 2012, the conservative political advocacy group  gave Walsh a 100 percent rating.\n\nThe ensuing campaign between Walsh and Duckworth emerged as a bitter race. At a July 2012 campaign event, Walsh accused his opponent of politicizing both her military service as a helicopter pilot and her Iraq War injuries, which cost her both legs and the partial use of one arm. He said, \"My God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, the men and women who served us, it's the last thing in the world they talk about.\" Walsh later suggested that she was, in fact, a \"true hero,\" but that she should not talk about her service so frequently, and that her service should not command votes. Walsh decided to skip the , distancing himself from establishment Republicans.\n\nWalsh's campaign was bolstered by major financial support in the form of outside spending by conservative s. In September 2012,  gave $1,950,000 to the Now or Never PAC, which then spent $2,022,039 to support Walsh and oppose Duckworth. Over $6.6&nbsp;million in outside spending was reported in the race, with Walsh receiving more than $6&nbsp;million of that total. Overall, Walsh outspent her $7&nbsp;million to $4.7&nbsp;million.\n\nDespite his spending advantage, on November 6, 2012, Duckworth unseated Walsh 55 to 45 percent. Despite his loss, Walsh outperformed the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, , who received 41% of the vote in the 8th district.

After being sworn in, Walsh announced that consistent with his opposition to government-provided health care and the 2010 health care reform legislation, he would not accept congressional health care benefits.\n\nDuring his early months in Congress, he emerged as a vocal critic of the  and President Obama's fiscal policies, and posted a YouTube video in which he accused President Obama of bankrupting the country. He also vowed, \"I won't place one more dollar of debt upon the backs of my kids and grandkids unless we structurally reform the way this town [Washington, D.C.] spends money!\" He became a frequent fixture on cable TV, advocating a \"no compromise\" approach to deficit reduction that rejects any tax increases on the wealthy. He consistently voted against raising the federal debt ceiling and authored a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution.

He was on air again the next day. WIND general manager Jeff Reisman commented: \"During the segment Joe intended to cite several common racial slurs as examples. He did not in any way use them in a defamatory or derogatory manner, simply as examples. However, AM 560 The Answer did not allow them to go on the air. AM 560 The Answer has a policy of not using certain words on the air that are highly inflammatory and offensive even in the context of a discussion of why those words are offensive. We will continue that policy.\"\n\nOn January 14, 2015, following the , in a tweet which he described as satirical, Walsh called for Islamists to \"behead\" reporters on  and  and referred to them as \"appeasing cowards\" for not airing cartoons published by the French satirical magazine  which depicts prophet .

He was also reportedly facing a lawsuit by a former campaign manager who claimed Walsh owed him $20,000 for services and had federal and state tax liens in the 1980s and 1990s (all paid by 2001). Walsh explained that the major portion of the past due taxes were on a college trust fund he received from his grandfather and that neither he nor his family had been aware that the funds were taxable. He also explained that his more recent financial struggles have made him more attuned to the difficulties faced by the average constituent.\n\nIn July 2011, the '''' reported that Walsh's ex-wife, Laura, was suing him for $117,437 for past due child support dating from 2005 for their three children. Walsh allegedly had told his ex-wife that he did not have the money because he was out of work; she had later seen from his campaign disclosures that he had been employed. Walsh's attorney said that Walsh did not owe \"anywhere near that amount,\" and that he had had no more problems paying child support than \"any other average guy\". Walsh and his ex-wife began working out a settlement of the disputed past due amount in late July 2011. Walsh's financial problems inspired the proposal of a bill which would forbid people owing more than $10,000 in back child support from running for office in Illinois. On April 20, 2012, a settlement was reached, and the case dismissed. As part of the settlement, Walsh issued a statement on behalf of himself and his ex-wife which read, in part, \"Having resolved these issues together and cleared up these mistakes in private, we now agree that Joe is not and was not a 'deadbeat dad' and does not owe child support.\"\n\nIn August 2011, the '''' reported that Walsh lost his driving privileges from mid-April to mid-July 2011 because he let his insurance lapse. In response, Walsh criticized the ''Tribune'' for \"wast[ing] time and ink scrutinizing [his] driving record over the last 22 years rather than Washington's unsustainable spending\".\n\nOn February 1, 2013, Walsh filed a motion to terminate child support obligations, claiming that as he was now unemployed he was unable to contribute to the support of his children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* ''F*ck Silence: Calling Trump Out for the Cultish, Moronic, Authoritarian Con Man He Is'' (2020)\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n* Karoun Demirjian, , ''The Washington Post'', July 8, 2016.\n* Patrick Goldstein and James Rainey, , '''', January 27, 2010.\n* Diana Sroka, , '''', November 11, 2010.\n* , '''', , October 17, 2012.\n\n\n\n* \n* \n*  \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In 2001, he was appointed to the  by . He is the son of , who  himself had served as Cook County Board president for 12 years until his death.\n\n, Stroger finished last in the Democratic primary for President of the Cook County Board behind , Terrence J. O'Brien and  (who won the primary), putting him in a  stage for the remainder of his board presidency. Preckwinkle would go on to win the general election and assume office on December 6, 2010.\n\nIn 2021, Stroger served as  of .\n\n\nStroger was raised in the  neighborhood, located on Chicago's . He attended  and later received his bachelor's degree from  in . Before becoming an alderman he worked as an investment banker for SBK Brooks Investment Corporation.\n\n\nIn 1992, Stroger was elected as State Representative for the 31st District of Illinois. Stroger worked as a statistician for the Office of the Chief Judge of ; later he was also a jury supervisor with the Cook County Jury Commissioners. He worked for the  during the tenure of .\n\nStroger is an active fundraiser for the  and a member of the .\n\n\nIn 2001 Stroger was appointed by Mayor Richard M. Daley to replace , who had died while in office. Stroger served on seven committees: Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, and Ethics; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; Police and Fire; Special Events and Cultural Affairs; and Traffic Control and Safety.\n\n\nOn March 14, 2006, , Cook County Board of Commissioners president since 1994 and Todd Stroger's father, suffered a serious  one week before the Democratic primary. John Stroger eventually won the Democratic nomination, winning about 53 percent of the votes cast, defeating . For months after the elder Stroger's stroke he did not appear in public, and his family provided little information about his condition.\n\nShortly after the stroke, Todd Stroger gave noncommittal responses about the likelihood that his father would remain on the ballot. But in May, he reversed his previous stance, saying his father would return to office. Ultimately, John Stroger would submit his resignation. At the same time that John Stroger submitted his resignation, it was announced that alderman  would assume the County Commissioner seat while Todd Stroger, if elected, would take over the County Board presidency. This announcement came four days after the deadline for third-party candidates to file for the Board presidency race.\n\nIn the aftermath of his father's resignation, Todd Stroger emerged as the front-runner for his father's presidential seat. His main opponent was U.S. Representative . Another opponent, County Commissioner , dropped out of the race shortly before party leaders chose a new candidate.\n\nOn July 18, 2006, the Cook County Democratic Central Committee (a collection of 80 county Democratic party leaders also known as \"ward committeemen\" or \"township committeemen\") overwhelmingly chose Todd Stroger to replace his father as the Democratic candidate for Cook County Board president for the Nov. 7, 2006 election. The following day, Steele was unanimously elected by the Board as interim president.\n\nAccording to state election officials, in July 2008, Stroger's campaign paid almost $27,000 in fines for failing to file paperwork in a timely manner. Paperwork was not filed on time for the 2006  contributions it received along with late organization papers that were sent to the election board. The campaign also filed incomplete and late reports to the State  during the week of July 21, 2008, so more fines are expected to be brought forth.\n\n\nStroger was a candidate in the Democratic primary of the . However, he withdrew his candidacy once a challenge to his ballot petitions had disqualified enough signatures to have him removed from the ballot. \n\nAfter Darren E. Bryant was elected the mayor of  in April 2021, he announced his intention to appoint Stroger as village administrator (). On October 5, 2021, Stroger was moved from his position as village administrator to the position of executive assistant to Bryant, switching places with Jasmine Washington (who became village administrator).\n\n\n\nStroger drew fire for perceived , including promoting his cousin Donna Dunnings, who had worked in the County's budget office for 16 years, to the position of the County's . Dunnings and Stroger received additional criticism when she received a $17,000 raise after she initially agreed to not accept a pay hike (in an attempt to help county finances). Dunnings stated that critics could have blocked the pay raise by submitting an amendment to the proposed budget \"if they were so concerned about the salary of the first African-American female CFO\".\n\nDunnings was later forced to resign her position after the press reported that she had posted bail for Tony Cole, a former  basketball player and busboy whom Stroger had hired to a $60,000/year Cook County position despite Cole's having an extensive  record. On April 16, 2009, Dunnings resigned at Stroger's request over the scandal involving the hiring of Cole as a human resources assistant in the County Highway Department. Stroger had earlier fired Cole (in  in connection with a domestic violence case at the time Dunnings resigned) for concealing his .\n\n\nStroger also drew criticism when he began raising certain taxes in an effort to balance the county budget and resolve staffing issues.  In September 2007, he voiced his support for a proposal to raise the county-wide sales tax to 11 percent (an additional two cents on the dollar) to remedy a $307 million budget deficit, which would force public facilities such as  to cut services or even close. Critics of the plan included fellow Commissioners Claypool, Gorman, Peraica, and  who argued that spending cuts would accomplish the same purpose. Peraica additionally responded that Cook County's poorest citizens, who the tax hike is ultimately designed to serve, would find it to be the most unaffordable. Peraica's argument was seconded by then-Governor , who expressed his opposition to the plan. Gorman was instrumental, however, in refusing to back down and she introduced a resolution to repeal the sales tax on three separate occasions, finally winning board majority support on the third effort.\n\nOn February 29, 2008, the Cook County Board, by a measure of 10-7, passed a budget initiated by Stroger. Stroger's budget contained a tax increase of 1 percentage point, the largest ever passed by Cook County, with the intent of creating more than 1,000 new County jobs. As a result of Stroger's bill, on July 1 the County sales tax increased from 0.75 percent to 1.75 percent bringing Chicago's overall sales tax to 10.25 percent, which was the highest of any major U.S. city, while the sales tax was a minimum of 8.75 percent in suburban Cook County. All five  members of the County Board voted against the tax increase and they were joined by two of the twelve Democrats. Commissioners who voted against the tax increase were , Quigley, Claypool, , , Peraica, and .  Despite the 133% increase, Dunnings stated on March 31, 2008, that the budget shortfall resolved that year is expected to return.  She explained that the expected cost increase would be the result of what she described as a 'structural deficit', meaning increases in revenue being unable to match increases in expense, citing runaway health care costs among other problems.  A county spokesman indicated that it would most likely happen in three or four years, well into the next county presidential term.\n\nBecause of a number of unanswered questions and unresolved issues surrounding the county tax increase, Cook County's outlying communities, particularly , considered secession and threatened to do so unless an explanation was provided. To avoid this schism, officials from Palatine and Cook County, including Stroger initially, agreed to hold a  at  on April 30 to discuss details of the hike that remain unclear.  However, on April 29, Stroger announced that he would not attend, accusing Palatine officials of using the meeting for political grandstanding indicating that he \"[would] not debate local Palatine elected officials who expect to exploit this opportunity to further their own political agendas\". Eventually, Stroger did attend the Town Hall, which resulted in heavy press coverage and several '''' articles refuting the claims he made while presenting there.\n\nThe tax increase was later partially rolled back by 0.5%.    Chicago's overall sales tax is 9.75% and suburban Cook County is at minimum 8.25%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The 50th Ward encompasses part of Chicago's far North Side and includes the  and Peterson Park neighborhoods. First elected to the Council in 1973, Stone was the second longest-serving alderman (after ). His tenure spanned the terms of seven Mayors, from  to . Stone was also Vice Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1998 to 2011.\n\nStone was a part of the \"\", which opposed Mayor 's agenda. Though he was a  for most of his life, Stone briefly followed Alderman  to the , and unsuccessfully ran against  for   in . Stone was a protagonist in a protracted legal conflict with the neighboring suburb of  in 1993–1994. Employees of Stone's 2007 re-election campaign were convicted of vote fraud in 2010. Stone was \"outspoken\" and \"relished the rough and tumble of politics\".\n\n\nStone was born on November 24, 1927 in Chicago to Jewish immigrant parents. He was educated in the  system at Von Humboldt Elementary and Tuley High School, which is now . Stone enlisted in the United States Army in 1945. Stone attended Wright Junior College, now known as , and .\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1956, Stone ran in the Democratic primary for the , but was defeated by , who went on to serve in the Illinois House for ten years and became Illinois' first female state senator.\n\nIn 1963, Stone was one of a record 233 candidates filing to run for Chicago alderman, and one of ten challengers to the incumbent in the 50th Ward, Republican Alderman Jack I. Sperling, who sought a third four-year term. Stone filed without the endorsement of a political party. By February 1963, Stone was not on the ballot for the February 26, 1963, election.\n\n\n\nOn January 29, 1973, the  appointed Alderman Sperling to fill a vacancy as Cook County  judge. The  called a special election for June 5, 1973, to fill vacant City Council seats, including the 50th Ward alderman seat. Stone was an employee in the office of Cook County Sheriff Richard Elrod and the vice president of the 50th Ward Regular Democratic Organization, which endorsed him for alderman. Stone was one of five candidates who filed to finish Sperling's term. Another candidate, independent Theodore Berland, was a medical writer and nationally recognized anti-noise activist who was chiefly responsible for Chicago's anti-noise ordinance. }} Stone organized the \"Concerned Citizens of the 50th Ward\" to counter neighboring 's opposition to a bridge over the  at Pratt Avenue, which Stone called a \"necessity\" for the 50th Ward. In the first round of voting, Stone led with 47% of the vote and Berland finished second, with 27%. In the run-off election on July 3, 1973, Stone defeated Berland 12,882 to 10,958, with a turnout of about 53%, winning the 50th Ward for Democrats for the first time since 1955.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Alderman and former  chairman  converted to the  and encouraged Stone to follow suit and run for . By threatening Republican Party of Cook County leadership that he would run for county Chairman and Cook County , Vrdolyak brokered a deal to slate himself for Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County and Stone for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. On October 29, 1987, Stone announced he had joined the Republican Party and expressed his intention to run for Recorder. \"I can no longer be part of a party that punishes law-abiding, tax-paying citizens and communities\", Stone said, adding that he also felt \"the Democratic Party is drifting away from America's historically strong commitment to Israel\".\n\nOn November 25, 1987, Chicago Mayor  died. Stone announced his candidacy for mayor to fellow aldermen on November 29  and to the public on December 1. Many saw Stone's mayoral candidacy as an attempt to publicize his Recorder race. Two days later the City Council elected Alderman  as mayor.\n\n, Stone ran as a Republican against African-American Democratic Illinois State Representative  for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Stone told reporters that although he did not expect their newspapers' endorsements, \"Just run a picture of Braun. That's all I ask\". Stone included Braun's photograph in his campaign flyers. Stone was defeated by Braun and contributed to a sweep of Cook County offices by Democrats.\n\nIn , Stone unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Mayor of Chicago, to unseat Mayor Sawyer.  defeated Sawyer in the Democratic primary and Republican nominee Edward Vrdolyak in the general election to become mayor. In 1990, Stone returned to the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nAlthough resident and corporate relations between Chicago and neighboring suburb  are generally cordial and co-operative, Stone was a protagonist in perhaps the most significant altercation in recent decades. The Evanston City Council adopted the Southwest II  (TIF) District, also called the Howard-Hartrey TIF, on April 27, 1992, in order to incent the development of a disused 23-acre  distribution center. A city contractor installed a $150,000,  high, three-block-long, continuous steel guardrail down the middle of Howard Street, from Kedzie Avenue to California Avenue, blocking vehicles from crossing between Evanston and Chicago, to protect residents from the vehicular traffic expected at a proposed shopping center on the Evanston side of Howard Street that was projected to open in 1995. A Cook County  judge denied Evanston's request for a  to halt the erection of the barrier, which became known in the media as \"Berny's Wall\". The '''' editorialized calling Stone \"silly\" and the guardrail a \"senseless idea...just an insipid ploy by a useless alderman who has too much time on his hands and too much of the taxpayers' money at his disposal\".\n\nOn May 28, 1993, Evanston Mayor , Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Stone, and city officials met at Chicago City Hall, and hours later, Morton announced that Evanston would drop legal action against Chicago. The next day, after consultation with Evanston's  and others, Evanston announced they would continue legal recourse in conjunction with negotiations. Stone demanded that Evanston pick up the cost of the installation and removal of the guardrail. On June 1, 1993, the Evanston City Council voted to refuse to contribute funds, to continue their lawsuit, and to defer modifications to the site plan until the barrier was dismantled.\n\nTestimony began July 25, 1994. Chicago Transportation Commissioner Joseph Boyle Jr. and Planning Commissioner  testified that the guardrail had been installed at Stone's request without the benefit of traffic or planning studies. A partner of the shopping center's construction firm testified that Stone had discussed with him in 1992 the idea of siting the project on vacant land near the Lincoln Village Shopping Center, a site that was scheduled to be redistricted into the 50th Ward in 1995. Evanston officials said Stone was jealous of the project going to Evanston. On September 21, 1994, the judge ruled that the March 25, 1993, resolution which Stone ushered through the Chicago City Council authorized Chicago's Department of Transportation commissioner to ''consider'' a barrier, declared that the Department had no authority to install the guardrail, ordered Chicago to remove it and pay all costs including Evanston's legal fees, and dismissed Chicago's countersuit to block the shopping center. Chicago's request for a stay pending appeal was denied, Bell and Howell agreed to pay the estimated $35,000 to remove the barrier, and removal began on October 4, 1994. \"The party isn't over until the fat man sings, and I'm the fat man\", said Stone. The ''Chicago Tribune'' editorialized calling the barrier \"a petty, indulgent waste of money at the people's expense\".\n\nStone passed legislation through the Chicago City Council to change to one-way, northbound only, portions of Kedzie and Sacramento Avenues, two Chicago streets south of the shopping center. After the changes were implemented November 10, 1994, Stone's office received numerous complaints, and by November 16 Kedzie was again a two-way street.\n\nOn November 3, 1999, the City of Chicago established the Lincoln Avenue TIF district, including the Lincoln Village Shopping Center area.\n\n\n\n\n\nA photograph of Stone asleep in Council Chambers, during a hearing on an ordinance restricting the use of a cell phone while operating an automobile, ran on the front page of the '''' in January 2004. \"Some aldermen have a tendency while they're thinking to close their eyes and that may register with their constituency as not paying attention or, perhaps, even sleeping during the session\", Stone later explained. Stone fell asleep at his desk in Council Chambers in City Hall during the City Council's Finance Committee debate on the controversial  in December 2008 and was photographed by the press. Stone was videotaped sleeping during a Finance Committee hearing on the transparency of the City's tax increment financing program in March 2009.\n\n\n\nOn September 4, 2007, speaking from the floor of Council Chambers during a meeting of the Buildings Committee, Stone warned fellow aldermen of an ongoing investigation into absentee balloting. On January 28, 2008, two employees of Stone's 2007 re-election campaign were arrested and charged with improperly influencing voters, primarily from the ward's Indian and Pakistani communities, to vote absentee for Stone. Anish Eapen, a  and a ward superintendent with the city's Streets and Sanitation Department, was charged with \"official misconduct, absentee ballot fraud, and mutilation of election materials\". Eapen allegedly partnered with Armando Ramos, an unemployed student, who was also charged with absentee ballot fraud and mutilation of election materials. Stone accused the state attorney's office of acting at the behest of the area's U.S. Representative, . \"We know where this all started. We know it's politically based. ... Her [Schakowsky's] aide was soliciting the state's attorney to investigate. It's absolutely a devious political trick\", he said. Schakowsky denied involvement. Bond was set at $50,000 and $40,000 for Eapen and Ramos, respectively.\n\nCity Inspector General  called for Eapen to be fired. For nearly two years, Eapen was on paid administrative leave from his $83,940-a-year job with the city. On October 8, 2009, Streets and Sanitation Department Commissioner Tom Byrne found Eapen a job tracking equipment. Stone blamed Byrne's predecessor for Eapen's paid leave, saying \"Mike Picardi has no ''''\".\n\nOn October 24, 2008, during the annual budget hearing process, Inspector General Hoffman testified before the Committee on the Budget of the Chicago City Council. \"It is my intent, Mr. Inspector General, to wipe your entire office out of the budget\", Stone told Hoffman. \"It is my intent to submit a budget amendment which will destroy your department\". \"He's come after me, so I'm going after him. That's the way the game is played\", Stone said. Stone's amendment came before the Budget Committee on November 17, 2008, and was tabled 14-2.\n\nEapen and Ramos waived their right to trial by jury. In a , four members of a family who lived in the ward testified that Eapen came to their homes, watched as they completed the absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots, collected their ballots, and mailed them. One family member, who was not registered to vote, testified that Eapen filled out her ballot and she signed it. Another witness testified that when she told Stone in his office that Ramos filled out her ballot, Stone was dismissive, saying, \"This meeting is over\". Stone commented on the testimony, \"I have no recollection of what she is talking about\".\n\nOn June 24, 2010, Cook County Judge Marcus Salone found Eapen and Ramos each guilty on one count of attempted mutilation of voting materials and additional counts of attempted absentee ballot violations. On August 4, 2010, Salone sentenced Eapen and Ramos to prison terms of 364 days and 270 days, respectively. Salone said \"I think the evidence is overwhelming. The reality is that Mr. Eapen and Mr. Ramos attempted to steal democracy and they did it in a vicious way\". Stone called the case \"a witch hunt\", said that Ramos and Eapen were \"political prisoners\", and compared their crimes to \"spitting on the sidewalk\". Stone said Inspector General Hoffman targeted his staff while failing to investigate other aldermen's staffs. \"They are not the ones who attempted to steal democracy. The one who attempted to steal democracy was David Hoffman\", Stone said. \"This is a miscarriage of justice\".\n\n\n\nStone was the Chairman of the City Council Committee on Buildings, and also served on the following City Council committees: Budget and Government Operations, Finance, Historical Landmark Preservation, Housing and Landmark Preservation, Traffic Control and Safety, and the Committee on Committees.\n\n\nIn 2008, Illinois State Senator  defeated Stone in the voting for the 50th Ward Democratic , an unpaid party post. In February 2011, in a five-way race for alderman including Silverstein's wife,  , no candidate garnered 50% plus one of the vote, forcing a run-off. In the April 2011 run-off, Debra Silverstein prevailed with 62% of the vote to 38% for Stone. On election night, Stone said Silverstein would be \"a disaster for this ward. There's no way I'll help her. She knows nothing\". Stone's tenure as alderman spanned seven Chicago Mayors, including two Mayors Daley.\n\n\nStone stated his political philosophy as \"You take care of the people who take care of you – you know, the people who voted for you. That's not Chicago politics, that's Politics 101\".\n\n\nIn 2017 a 1.8 acre greenspace along the  just south of  in the 50th ward was dedicated Berny Stone Park.\n\n\nStone married his wife, Lois (d. 1995), in 1949. They had three daughters and a son.\n\nStone worshipped at Congregation Ezras Israel and served on their Board of Directors. Stone also served on the Board of Directors for the Bernard Horwich Jewish Community Center, the Associated Talmud Torahs, and the Jewish National Fund.\n\nIn 2003, Stone's son, Jay, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent 32nd Ward Alderman .

In 1993, Senators Moseley Braun and  wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule. Soon after, female support staff followed their example. Later that year, the rule was amended by   to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore jackets.\n\nIn 1993, Moseley Braun made headlines when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the  because it contained the . The patent had been routinely renewed for nearly a century, and despite the Judiciary Committee's disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator  of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize the extension of the federal patent. Moseley Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation \"until this room freezes over.\" She also made a plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, \"It has no place in our modern times, place in this body, place in our society\". Swayed by Moseley Braun's argument, the Senate rejected the UDC's application to renew its patent.\n\nIn 1996, Moseley Braun made a private trip to , where she met with dictator . Despite U.S.  against that country due to Abacha's actions, the Senator neither notified nor registered her trip with the .  She subsequently defended Abacha's human rights record in Congress.'''', , May 6, 2003 Her former fiancé Kgosie Matthews, who also served on her campaign staff in violation of  regulations, had been a  for the Nigerian government; Matthews would later leave the country. She paid Matthews, a native of South Africa, a salary of $15,000 a month during the campaign.\n\nIn 1998, after  wrote a column reviewing the allegations of corruption against her, Moseley Braun responded to Will's comments, saying that \"I think because he couldn't say nigger, he said corrupt\".(defunct link.  as of June 13, 2007.), She also compared Will to a sman, saying: \"I mean this very sincerely from the bottom of my heart: He can take his hood and put it back on again, as far as I'm concerned\". Later, Moseley Braun apologized for her remarks.\n\n\n\nOn October 8, 1999, President Clinton nominated Moseley Braun to be the  and Samoa. Although her nomination ran into token opposition from her old adversary, , and from the senator who defeated her, , the Senate confirmed her on November 10, 1999, in a 96–2 vote.  She served in these roles until 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts had speculated that Moseley Braun was preparing for a potential run to reclaim her former Senate seat in the . However, in January 2003, Braun decided against running for the U.S. Senate again. On February 18, 2003, she announced her intention to run for the Democratic Party  nomination, doing so in a speech delivered at the University of Chicago Law School. Braun thereafter launched an exploratory committee for a presidential campaign. She had, in the days leading up to this announcement, made her first campaign-season visits to the early primary and caucus states of , , and . In her announcement speech she declared, \"It's time to take the 'men only' sign off the  door.\" She joined an already sizable field of candidates for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhen asked about her prospects of winning at the launch of her exploratory committee, Moseley Braun declared \"I have every hope and every expectation that this will be a successful effort. I'm running for president. I'm not running just to be another pretty face.\" Many, however, regarded her campaign to be a long shot, with many also regarding it as more of a vanity campaign then a serious effort for the presidency. Some speculation even existed that she was running to siphon black voters away from 's candidacy. Other speculation existed that she was running in an effort to redeem her image after her scandals as a senator and 1998 reelection defeat.\n\n\nAfter this exploratory phase, Braun formally launched her candidacy on September 23, 2003. Moseley Braun's campaign operation was initially based between two headquarters, one in Chicago and one in  They were later consolidated to a single headquarters in Chicago.\n\n\nBy July 2003, Moseley Braun had failed to release any detailed policy papers. Eric Slater of the '''' wrote that, during the , rather than focusing on policy, Moseley Braun largely partook in jockeying against candidates such as Sharpton and  to appear like the candidate who stood in greatest contrast to incumbent Republican George W. Bush. Despite her lack of policy papers, Braun did voice her positions on a number of issues.\n\nMoseley Braun made her support for a  system a signature issue of her candidacy. Her proposal was for such a system to be paid for by direct income tax. She also proposed merging  and  into a unified health program. When she launched her exploratory campaign, she positioned herself in opposition to a potential war with the country of , which would ultimately materialize months later as the . After that war began, she would criticize president  for how he proceeding in going to war with what she considers disregard for the , and would criticize the  for \"abdicating its constitutional role\" in allowing Bush to go to war. She also raised concerns about the rising national budget deficit. She described herself as a \" peace dove\", and called for the national budget to be balanced. She ran in general opposition to the measures implemented by the  in the aftermath of , arguing that their policies were exploiting Americans' fear after the attacks to put in place \"an extreme agenda, dangerous and divisive\" and to take away . She was particularly critical of  's expansion law enforcement powers. She argued that the United States should combat  by addressing underlying causes of it, such as by fostering \"stability and opportunity\" within  that might otherwise \"provide fertile recruiting grounds for terrorists and extremists.\" She pledged to regain global goodwill for the United States and restore international cooperation that she argued had dissipated due to Bush's post-9/11 actions.\n\nMoseley Braun also called for a reversal to childcare and education funding cuts, proposing funding the reinstatement of previous funding by eliminating the , simplifying the tax process, and eliminating any corporate loopholes that incentivize the  of corporate operations. She opposed  programs, asserting her belief that they deprived  of resources. She argued that state and federal funding for public schools needed to be increased to decrease the burden carried by local taxes, arguing that there was a \"disproportionate burden property tax payers carry to fund America's public schools.\"\n\nMoseley Braun argued that the United States should position itself as a leading force in achieving the environmental goals of the , and should invest in  with the goal of eliminating the United States' reliance on s (including foreign oil). She also opposed extracting oil in protected areas, especially pointing to locations in . She also called for the United States to pressure international free trade organizations such as the  to make the protection of labor rights, human rights, and environmental standards prerequisites for countries to involve themselves in international trade.\n\nMoseley Braun also opposed any , and voiced support for increasing the availability  (IRA) and s to low-income workers and women in order to remove inequity in retirement security.\n\n\nMoseley Braun's campaign strategy had placed an emphasis on hopes of performing well in . With that primary's traditionally sizable black electorate, it was seen to be a likely test of black enthusiasm for her candidacy. Moseley Braun was one of only two major black contenders for the Democratic nomination in 2004, with the other being Al Sharpton. Moseley Braun was also the only significant female candidate running in the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Moseley Braun's campaign would ultimately end up focusing their efforts on the African-American and female vote, which they regarded to be her base of support.\n\nMoseley Braun's campaign struggled to raise funds. In the first three months of 2003, she raised only $72,450 for her candidacy, less than any other notable contenders in the Democratic primary. As a consequence, she had very few professional campaign staffers. Her campaign was instead largely run by a small number of volunteers. It took until July 1, 2003, for her campaign to hire a formal . As the race developed, she continued to trail the other candidates in terms of fundraising. By July 2003, she had only raised $214,000, continuing to be lowest-performing of the nine major Democratic contenders in terms of fundraising. By November 2003, she had only raised $342,518. In total, her campaign would ultimately raise just under $600,000.\n\nIn mid-November 2003, Moseley Braun hired  to serve as her campaign's new manager.\n\nMoseley Braun never performed higher than single-digit numbers in polls for the primaries. Moseley Braun also failed to qualify for the ballot in a number of the scheduled state primaries and caucuses. On January 15, 2004, two days after a disappointing third place showing in the D.C. primary and four days before the , Moseley Braun dropped out of the race and endorsed . Shortly before Moseley Braun withdrew, her own campaign manager, Patricia Ireland, had publicly conceded that she no longer believed Moseley Braun stood any chance of capturing the Democratic nomination. Upon her departure from the race,  of the '''' wrote that, \"she leaves the race after having made no impact on it, except for some bright moments in the presidential debates\".\n\n\n\n \nIn November 2010, after Chicago mayor  announced that he would not seek re-election, Moseley Braun announced she would run for mayor of Chicago in . In early 2011, two potentially strong African-American candidatesU.S. Rep.  and State Sen. left the race and endorsed Moseley Braun, making her the so-called consensus black candidate. This came after a discussions between Moseley Braun and the other two candidates where it was decided that Moseley Braun, with her profile as a former US Senator, ambassador, and presidential candidate, would be the strongest of the three candidates. These discussions had occurred with the involvement of Chicago African American figures such Jesse Jackson and \n\nMoseley Braun appeared likely to be a strong contender for the mayoralty. However, a series of scandals and blunders would result in her finishing fourth in the election.\n\nMoseley Braun had several difficulties with her candidacy, including a lack of funding. She raised approximately $705,000, while  raised over $15 million. While referred to as the \"consensus\" African American candidate, she was not receiving much financial backing or from African American politicians and community leaders, many of whom instead backed Rahm Emanuel. Only a few of the city's African-American business leaders (including  and ) contributed to her campaign. She also received $25,000 from congressman . With a lack of funds, Moseley Braun only was able to air a single television ad, which she ran late in the campaign.  African American politicians and community leaders also did not provide non-financial assistance to Moseley Brown's campaign effort. Moseley Braun's campaign also received no support from s. Moseley Braun encountered criticism for accepting donations from individuals who had already donated the $5,000 maximum (which was instituted January 1, 2011 when the Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act went into effect).\n\nAdditionally, Moseley Braun suffered from a poorly run campaign. There was internal conflict within Moseley Braun's campaign organization. Her candidacy was also plagued by gaffes, including missed interviews and an inability to provide a sufficient explanation for her past financial problems. However, the most serious debacle came in a debate on January 30, 2011, when Moseley Braun accused another candidate, , of \"being strung out on crack\" for 20 years. Van-Pelt Watkins had once been addicted to cocaine, but had been clean for 30 years. This attack on Van-Pelt Watkins backfired and was detrimental to Moseley Braun's own candidacy. Braun's campaign, which had never gained much traction, began to bleed what support it had after she made this attack, with many former supporters fleeing to support Emanuel instead.\n\nAs a candidate, Moseley Braun opposed moving the city to having an elected . Moseley Braun also criticized frontrunner Rahm Emanuel's tax proposals, arguing that they would fail to assist poorer Chicagoans. She also accused Emanuel of having numerous times voted against  proposals that would have assisted lower-income families. As a candidate, Braun also placed an emphasis on her governmental experience and her ties to the city's black community.\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Moseley Braun came in fourth in the field of six, receiving about nine percent of the vote. In her concession speech, she remarked that her young niece could become the first female mayor of Chicago, despite the fact that  had already served as Chicago's first female mayor.\n\n\nIn the , Moseley Braun endorsed . In the  runoff, Moseley Braun endorsed . In the  runoff, Moseley Braun endorsed .\n\nIn the , Moseley Braun endorsed . During the , Biden mentioned her endorsement, misspeaking and mistakenly referring to her as \"the ''only'' African-American woman who's ever been elected to the United States Senate\", only to be quickly corrected by his opponents, including , who herself happened to be the second (and only other) African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. This gaffe of Biden's attracted significant media attention. Moseley Braun traveled to various states to campaign on Biden's behalf. At the , she was responsible for announcing Illinois' votes in the roll call. After Biden's victory in the general election (with Kamala Harris as his vice presidential ), Moseley Braun made it publicly known that she was interested in being his . She also expressed interest in holding some other role in his administration. Biden opted to nominate  for Secretary of the Interior.\n\n\n\nIn January 2023, Biden nominated Moseley Braun to be member and chair of the board of directors of the . In January 2024, Biden again put forth the nomination. The nomination to serve on the board was confirmed on March 8, 2024. Her term on the board will extend until September 22, 2029. She was sworn in as board member and chair in April 2024.\n\n\nIn 2005, Moseley Braun founded an organic products company known as Good Food Organics. Good Food Organics was the parent company of Ambassador Organics. As of 2019, the company was defunct.\n\nMoseley Braun became a visiting professor of political science at  in November 2016.\n\n''Trailblazer: Perseverance in Life and Politics'', a  authored by Moseley Braun, is scheduled to be published on January 21, 2026, by .\n\n\nIn September 1998, Lauryn Kaye Valentine applied for permission to change her name to Carol Moseley Braun. Valentine cited the former senator as her hero and promised not to \"dishonor [the] name\". The change was made official. That December, however, Valentine put her name forward as a candidate for alderman of Chicago's 37th Ward. Before the election, a Circuit Court judge rescinded the name change, forcing Valentine to revert to her original name. Valentine was later ruled ineligible to run, as she was not a registered voter at the time because of her name changes.\n\nIn April 2007, Braun suffered a broken wrist when a  emerged from bushes near her front door to steal her purse. Braun resisted and fell during the struggle, fracturing her left wrist. The mugger was chased off by a  student while his girlfriend called . Braun was later treated at a hospital and released. A man was later charged with the crime and was sentenced to 20 years in prison on July 11, 2008.\n\nBraun's financial problems made headlines in October 2012 when it was revealed that her home was in  and that she had not made any  payments for over a year.

Ethics scandals had plagued the previous administration of Republican  (no relation to Jim Ryan), and Blagojevich's campaign focused on the theme of \"ending business as usual\" in state government. Polls prior to the election found that many Illinois voters were confused about the names of George Ryan and Jim Ryan, a fact which Blagojevich used to his advantage.

Topinka ran advertisements detailing Blagojevich's federal investigations and non-endorsements by major state Democrats such as . A three-term state treasurer, Topinka said that she had attempted to stop Blagojevich from using money from special funds for general expenditures without approval of the legislature; she said Blagojevich used the funds for projects meant to distract voters from his associates' corruption trials: \"This constant giving away of money ... a million here, a million there, it raids our already hamstrung government and deadbeat state.\" Topinka's spokesman claimed that Blagojevich was the most investigated governor in Illinois history. Topinka lost to Blagojevich by 11%.\n\n\n  in 2005]]\nAfter the 2002 elections, Democrats had control of the Illinois House, Senate, and all but one statewide office. While in office, Blagojevich signed  legislation such as ethics reform,  reform, a state , a statewide comprehensive smoking ban and expansions of health programs like KidCare and FamilyCare (FamilyCare was ruled unconstitutional). Blagojevich signed a bill in 2005 that prohibited discrimination based on  in employment, housing, public accommodations, and credit. Blagojevich originally campaigned against , but eventually used it himself to gain more votes for bills.\n\nSoon after taking office in 2003, Blagojevich continued support of a  on  of  inmates, even though no such executions are likely to occur for years (his predecessor, ,  all of the death sentences in the state shortly before leaving office in 2003). This support continued through his administration.\n\nAnother notable action of his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for re-election in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might not have occurred. Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator .  and s were Blagojevich's staunchest political supporters. In 2008, he told a group of African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.\n\n\nBlagojevich oversaw record increases in funding for education every year without raising general sales or income taxes. He was criticized by Republicans and many moderate Democrats for using funds from the state pension system in order to fund other spending. Another early 2006 proposal included \"PreSchool for All\" for all three- and four-year-old children in Illinois. Legislation authorizing the program was adopted as part of the fiscal year 2007 budget.\n\n\nOn January 10, 2006, Blagojevich announced a proposal for a new $3 billion (US) spending plan for Illinois roads, mass transit, and schools, to be paid for by increased tax revenue and new gambling proposals (such as  and lottery games). The proposal met with immediate opposition by members of the Republican Party of Illinois and many Democrats, who viewed it as \"an election year ploy\". The suggestion to legalize Keno within Illinois was later withdrawn. As of 2008, Blagojevich had been unable for five years to agree to a capital plan that would improve Illinois infrastructure.\n\nIn March 2008, Blagojevich announced a bipartisan coalition, chaired by former U.S. Speaker of the House  and Former U.S. Congressman , to develop a capital construction plan that could pass the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois Works Coalition toured the state and developed a compromise $34 billion package that relied on a lease of the Illinois Lottery, road funds, and expanded gambling for funding. The plan passed the Senate but stalled in the Illinois House, with opposition from Democrats.\n\n\nBlagojevich called the Illinois General Assembly into special session 36 times while in office, which is half of the total number of special sessions called since 1970. The sessions were blamed for disrupting lawmakers' time off, while Blagojevich himself did not attend the sessions.\n\n\nBlagojevich disagreed with many state Democrats while in office, with House and Senate Republican leaders  and  often refereeing among the Democrats. During 2008, Blagojevich even expressed fear that House Democrats would gain more seats and he would face more opposition.\n\nBlagojevich's  was . Quinn and Blagojevich publicly disagreed over Blagojevich's proposed Gross Receipts Tax to increase revenue for schools and other projects within Illinois. Quinn said in December 2008 that he had last spoken to Blagojevich in the summer of 2007. Blagojevich also feuded with Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Comptroller , Secretary of State , and state treasurer &nbsp; all of whom are Democrats.\n\nBlagojevich was often at odds with members of both parties in the state legislature. Democratic legislator  said that the reason Blagojevich had problems passing laws with the cooperation of the General Assembly is that he did not spend enough time with the legislature. \"That's a real reason he has such poor relations with the Legislature and can't get any of his agenda passed, because he doesn't talk to anybody.\" When lawmakers working on a budget during a special session met at 10&nbsp;am rather than 2&nbsp;pm, and Blagojevich's attorney threatened that the Governor was considering legal action against the involved representatives, Democratic Rep.  told reporters, \"We have a madman. The man is insane.\"\n\n mayor John Spring appears at a press conference with Blagojevich to discuss  flood-relief efforts in 2008.]]\n\nAlthough  served as an adviser to Blagojevich's 2002 gubernatorial campaign, by all accounts, Blagojevich and Obama have been estranged for years. Blagojevich did not endorse Obama in the 2004 United States Senate race, and Obama did not invite Blagojevich to speak at the , as he did Lisa Madigan, Hynes, and Giannoulias. Blagojevich has had a \"friendly rapport\" with the man who took over his congressional seat, .\n\nBlagojevich has also disagreed publicly with then-Democratic Chicago Mayor ; after their dispute over  funding, Daley called Blagojevich \"cuckoo\" and said he did not want to argue with the Governor since \"He's arguing with everybody in America.\" Blagojevich replied, \"I don't think I'm cuckoo.\"\n\nSoon after a meeting of 2007 with Democratic State Senator , meant to convince Jacobs to vote for Blagojevich's health insurance proposals, Jacobs emerged telling reporters that the Governor \"blew up at him like a 10-year-old child\", Blagojevich would not comment on the alleged incident. Jacobs said during 2008: \"This is a governor who I don't think has a single ally, except for Senate president &nbsp; and that's tenuous at best.\" Jones and Blagojevich sometimes collaborated, while at other times they disagreed on funding for education.\n\nDuring a 2008 Congressional race pitting Democratic state senator  against Republican Marty Ozinga, the  ran television advertisements attempting to help Halvorson by linking Republican Ozinga to Blagojevich, asserting that Ozinga had given campaign donations to the Democratic governor.\n\n\nDuring early February 2006, Blagojevich appeared on '''' to discuss the governor's executive order that pharmacists must dispense any drugs for which a customer had a valid prescription, including s and . This measure was being challenged on the show by state legislator  from . Blagojevich was interviewed by , who repeatedly pretended to be unable to pronounce Blagojevich's name and simply called him \"Governor Smith\". At one point in the interview, Jones, who was acting as if he were against the governor's order, told him, \"I'll be in charge of what my listeners hear.\" This prompted Blagojevich to turn to the camera and ask, \"Is he teasing me or is that legit?\" Two weeks after the interview, Blagojevich said that he was unaware of the nature of the show. Stephens said he knew beforehand that the show was a comedy show: \"I thought the governor was hip enough that he would have known that, too.\"\n\nStephens later said, \"With all due respect to the governor, he knew it was a comedy show. It's general knowledge for people under 90 years of age. It was when he came off looking so silly that he said he thought it was a regular news program. Even assuming he didn't know about it beforehand, we had to sign a release before the interview.\"\n\nBlagojevich made another appearance on ''The Daily Show'' on August 23, 2010, after his removal from office. During his time on the show, he vehemently defended himself against host 's critique of things that he had previously said on the show. Stewart focused on how Blagojevich had expressed a great desire to tell his side in court, but then did not. Stewart attempted to get a promise that next time, Blagojevich would testify. Stewart also focused on Blagojevich's previous statement to him, that if one heard the famous \"effing golden\" statement in context, it would be seen as innocent. Stewart played the additional recording, and asked him how that sounded any different. The former governor had no concrete answers.\n\n\n\nBlagojevich was criticized for using what his opponents called \"gimmicks\" to balance the state budget. Republicans claimed that he was simply passing the state's fiscal problems on to future generations by borrowing his way to balanced budgets. Indeed, the 2005 state budget called for paying the bills by underfunding a state employees' pension fund by $1.2 billion.\n\nDuring 2008, Blagojevich proposed issuing $16 billion in new bonds for the state to meet pension fund requirements. Blagojevich once told a gathering of black ministers on Chicago's  that he was \"on the side of our Lord\" with his budget proposals.\n\nBlagojevich proposed a budget for 2008 with a 5% increase from the year before. Budget reductions of some programs caused Blagojevich to attempt to close 11 state parks and 13 state historic sites, with his spokesman saying Blagojevich had never visited any of them. To plug state budget holes, Blagojevich at one point proposed selling the  or mortgaging it. Blagojevich was also criticized for his handling of the 2007 state budget. In particular, critics cited his unprecedented use of line-item and reduction vetoes to remove his political opponents' \"member initiatives\" from the budget bill.\n\nDuring 2003, more than 1,000 Illinois judges began a  lawsuit against Blagojevich, because Blagojevich had stopped constitutionally-required cost of living pay increases for the judges due to budget reductions. The case was settled in the judges' favor in 2005, with Blagojevich's veto ruled as violating the state's constitution.\n\n\n (D-Chicago) advocating for changes in  legislation.]]\nDuring a suspected shortage of the  in 2004, Blagojevich ordered 260,000 doses from overseas distributors, which the  had warned would be barred from entering the United States. Although the vaccine doses had cost the state $2.6 million, the FDA refused to allow them into the country, and a buyer could not be found; they were donated to earthquake survivors in  a year later. However, the lots had expired, and Pakistan destroyed the vaccines.\n\nAlso in 2004, Blagojevich's plans to set up a website for Illinois residents to import medication from Canada and the United Kingdom was blocked by the U.S. . Imported medication would have saved users of the service 25 to 50 percent over domestic drugs.\n\nBlagojevich issued an executive order during 2004 requiring pharmacists in the state to dispense \"morning-after\" birth control, even if they object on moral or religious grounds. This order was legally challenged. Later in 2007, opponents of the governor's executive order reached a settlement with the state in one case, causing partial removal of the order. The settlement, which followed the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in September 2007 to hear an appeal of a lawsuit challenging the executive order, allowed pharmacists to decline to dispense birth control, so long as they provided information to customers about pharmacists who did. In another case, Morr-Fitz v. Blagojevich (later Morr-Fitz v. Quinn), the Illinois Court of Appeals ruled against Blagojevich's order.\n\nDuring October 2005, Blagojevich announced All Kids, his plan to provide access to state-subsidized healthcare for every child in Illinois. Signed into law by Blagojevich in November 2005, All Kids made Illinois the first state in the U.S. to attempt to legally require itself to provide universal affordable and comprehensive healthcare for children, regardless of income and immigration status.\n\nDuring March 2007, Blagojevich announced and campaigned for his universal healthcare plan, Illinois Covered. The plan was debated in the Illinois State Senate, but came one vote short of passing. He proposed to pay for the plan with the largest tax increase in Illinois history. He proposed a gross receipts tax on businesses, a $7.6 billion tax increase, with proceeds earmarked to provide universal healthcare in Illinois, increase education spending by $1.5 billion, fund a $25 billion capital construction plan, and reduce the State's $40 billion pension debt. Illinois House Speaker  called for a vote on a non-binding resolution on whether the state should impose a gross receipts tax. When it became apparent that the resolution would be defeated, Blagojevich announced at the last minute that supporters should vote against it, although the vote was intended to be a test vote to gauge whether the measure had any support. The request was seen by many lawmakers from both parties as an attempt to spin the loss positively. It was defeated by a vote of 107–0, which the  termed \"jaw-dropping\". When asked about the vote of the day, Blagojevich said, \"Today, I think, was basically an up. ... I feel good about it.\"\n\nBlagojevich also successfully proposed a new tax on businesses that do not provide health insurance to their employees.\n\nLawmakers did not approve another initiative of Blagojevich's, FamilyCare (which would provide healthcare for families of four making up to $82,000), but Blagojevich attempted to implement the plan unilaterally by . In rejecting Blagojevich's executive order, a legislative committee questioned how the state would pay for the program. Blagojevich's decision has been called unconstitutional by two courts, which nullified the plan. However, during October 2008, pharmacies which had followed Blagojevich's directive to dispense drugs under the plan were informed by his administration that they would not be reimbursed and would have payments given under the system deducted from future  payments. One state lawmaker, Republican , suggested that Blagojevich should pay the difference out of his own personal account. '''' agreed with Stephens in an editorial.\n\nAssociated Press attempted under the  to discover how the state planned to pay for the Blagojevich-ordered program, how many people were enrolled, or how much the care had cost the state but were refused the information by state departments.\n\n\nAfter Blagojevich pushed for a law banning sales of certain video games to minors, a federal judge declared the law violated the , with the state ordered to pay $520,000 in legal fees.\n in 2006]]\n\nBlagojevich vetoed three bills that would permit trucks to drive 65&nbsp;mph outside the Chicago area instead of the current 55&nbsp;mph, stating that one bill \"compromises safety\".\n\nBlagojevich threatened to stop the state's dealings with  Corp. over a shut-down factory in Chicago. On December 8, 2008, all state agencies were ordered to stop conducting business with Bank of America to pressure the company to make the loans. Blagojevich said the biggest U.S. retail bank would not get any more state business unless it restored credit to , whose workers were staging a . John Douglas, a former general counsel for the  and attorney for Bank of America, called Blagojevich's gambit dangerous.\n\n\nBlagojevich has been described as a \"staunch\" supporter of gun control.\n\nDuring his February 2006 \"State of the State\" address, Blagojevich said the state should ban semi-automatic firearms.\n\nAs a state legislator, Blagojevich proposed raising the price of an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card from $5 to $500.\nBlagojevich vetoed three gun bills in 2005, which would have:\n# Deleted records in gun database after 90 days\n# Eliminated the waiting period for someone wanting to buy a rifle or shotgun, when trading in a previously owned weapon\n# Overridden local laws regulating transport of firearms.\n\n\nIn early 2009, Blagojevich reported being so impressed by  that he considered offering Obama's vacant Senate seat to Winfrey. Blagojevich summarized his reasons for considering Winfrey on various talk shows:\n\n ... On the other hand, how likely is it she'd give up what she's doing for that? I mean, being a senator's a big deal, but it ain't Oprah.}}\n\nWinfrey noted that although she was uninterested, she did feel she could be a senator.\n\nPolitical analyst  praised Blagojevich's idea of making Winfrey a senator, suggesting that in one move it would diversify the Senate and raise its collective . Elaborating further he said:\n\n\n\n of the '''' agreed with Matthews, writing Winfrey would be \"terrific\" and an \"enormously popular pick\".\n\n\nBlagojevich was famed for his flamboyant dress style, such as his taste for  ties. After the Justice Department complaint was made public, Blagojevich's hairstyle became the subject of discussion and jokes for national and local media personalities. Blagojevich insisted his aides always carry a hairbrush for him. He referred to it as \"the football\", alluding to the term '''', which represents the bomb launch codes never to be out of reach of the president.\n\n\n\n\n, December 10, 2008]]\nBlagojevich threatened to stop the state's dealings with Bank of America Corp. over a shut-down factory in Chicago. This caused U.S. Attorney  to direct Blagojevich's arrest at his home by federal agents on December 9, 2008, and charge him with corruption. The  complaint alleged that the governor conspired to commit several \"\" schemes, including attempting \"to obtain personal gain ... through the corrupt use\" of his authority to fill the  seat vacated by  following his election as president, claiming that in wiretapped recordings Blagojevich discussed his desire to get something in exchange for an appointment to the seat. After various outreach efforts, he appointed former state attorney general  on New Year's Eve 2008. Burris was seated after some initial opposition in mid-January 2009. Chicago Tribune, December 9, 2008. A trial was set for June 3, 2010, and U.S. Attorney  spoke out on the charges, characterizing Blagojevich's actions as trying to auction the open seat off to \"the highest bidder\".\n\nThe Illinois House and Senate moved quickly to impeach the governor for abuse of power and corruption. On January 8, the Illinois House voted 114–1 (with three abstentions) to impeach Blagojevich. The charges brought by the House emphasized Blagojevich's alleged  and his alleged attempts to sell legislative authorizations and/or vetoes, and gubernatorial appointments including that of Obama's vacated Senate seat. Blagojevich was taped by the FBI saying \"I've got this thing, and it's fucking golden. I'm just not giving it up for fucking nothing.\"\n\nOn January 27, 2009, Blagojevich began a media campaign planned by publicist Glenn Selig. During the two-day campaign, he visited '''', '''', '''', '''', multiple programs on ,  and  where he proclaimed his innocence and insisted he would be vindicated.\n\nOn January 29, 2009, Blagojevich was removed from office and prohibited from ever holding public office in the state of Illinois again, by two separate and unanimous votes of 59–0 by the Illinois Senate. His lieutenant governor  subsequently became governor of Illinois.\n\nBlagojevich's impeachment trial and removal from office did not affect his federal  in the , since impeachment is a political as opposed to a criminal sanction in addition to being (in this particular case) a punishment imposed at the state level.\n\n\nAfter being convicted and removed from office by the , Blagojevich went on '''' and '''', where he re-affirmed his innocence and stated that the Illinois legislature's decision to remove him from office was politically motivated, being due to his unwillingness to raise taxes. He has accused his successor, , of using state funds excessively for personal leisure. A report later released by the Governor's office showed that most of Quinn's transportation fees were paid for by Quinn himself and that Quinn never accepted the $32 meal allowance from the State.\n\nBlagojevich attempted to make a deal to star in 's 2009 summer  '''' He made a request with the judge to ease his travel restrictions so that he could travel to  to star in the show, saying that his family needed to make money. However, his request was formally rejected by U.S. District Judge , who was sympathetic to Blagojevich's financial situation, but nevertheless stated, \"I don't think this defendant fully understands and I don't think he could understand ... the position he finds himself in.\" Judge Zagel went on further to note that Blagojevich must prepare for his defense.\n\nDespite the ruling, NBC expressed an interest in negotiating with the judge to have Blagojevich as a part of the show. His wife took his place on the show, which began airing June 1, 2009. He told an interviewer he found it difficult to watch his wife eat a dead  on the broadcast, but remarked that her willingness to participate in the show was \"an act of love\" because she was earning funds to alleviate their adverse financial position.\n\nOn June 13, 2009, Blagojevich starred in the  's musical ''Rod Blagojevich Superstar''. He performed in order to support the charity  Chicago, which offers support for people living with cancer.Second City, , www.secondcity.com, \n\nOn June 30, 2009, Blagojevich's  ''The Governor: The Truth Behind the Political Scandal That Continues to Rock the Nation'' was announced for print release on September 8, 2009.

He had previously been a guest host of the \"Don Wade and Roma Morning Show\" on WLS in March 2009. On June 2, 2010, WLS placed Blagojevich's radio show on hiatus while his corruption trial was ongoing.\n\nBlagojevich appeared on season 9 of '''' in Spring 2010, asserting that he has the \"skill and know-how to get things accomplished\" on the series. Series star and producer  praised Blagojevich's \"tremendous courage and guts\", and predicted that he would become one of the show's breakout stars. Trump subsequently fired Blagojevich in the fourth episode of the season, which aired April 4, 2010.\n\nIn an interview with '''' in January 2010, Blagojevich said about  , \"Everything he's saying's on the teleprompter. I'm blacker than Barack Obama. I shined shoes. I grew up in a five-room apartment. My father had a little laundromat in a black community not far from where he lived.

Most of the charges were related to attempts to sell the Senate seat vacated by then-President-elect . On August 17, 2010, he was convicted on one of the 24 federal charges, a charge of lying to the FBI, and the  on 23 other counts.Chicago Tribune, August 18, 2010, p. 1, \"Several panelists dissatisfied, point to lack of smoking gun' by Annie Sweeney, Vikki Ortiz Healy and Noreen S. Ahmed-Uilah. The defense did not call a single witness, claiming that prosecutors did not prove their case. Because the jury could not agree on the remaining charges, a mistrial was ordered for those counts. Within 15 minutes after the mistrial was declared, the  team announced that they would definitely pursue a retrial on the 23 mistrial counts. A post- court date was set for August 23, 2010. Federal prosecutors reduced the number of counts for Blagojevich's retrial, and, on June 27, 2011, he was found guilty of 17 of the 20 remaining charges and not guilty on one, and no verdict was rendered by the jury on two counts. He was found guilty on all charges pertaining to the Senate seat, as well as extortion relating to state funds being directed towards a children's hospital and race track. However, he was acquitted on a charge pertaining to the tollway extortion and avoided a guilty verdict (by split decision) on attempting to extort .\n\n\nHe reported to prison on March 15, 2012, at , Colorado. His  (BOP) number was 40892–424. Had his sentence not been commuted by President Donald Trump, under federal rules, Blagojevich would have served at least 85%, or 12 years, of his sentence after which time he may have been eligible for early release in March 2024, based on good behavior. However, President Trump commuted his sentence so he was released on February 18, 2020.\n\nWhile in the federal penitentiary, Blagojevich was the lead singer for prison band called \"The Jailhouse Rockers\", named after an  song. The band dissolved when the lead guitarist was released. He was the fourth Illinois governor to serve time in federal prison, after ,  (post-governorship criminal activity), and  (crimes starting during his prior service as Secretary of State).\n\n\nBlagojevich appealed his conviction, claiming judicial bias and a tainted jury pool. He has also long contended that there was critical evidence the jury never heard, including witness testimony and recorded phone calls that Judge Zagel did not allow to be played during the trial. They have also argued that Blagojevich's own testimony was restricted by Judge Zagel's rulings.\n\nIn July 2013, Blagojevich filed an appeal with the  in Chicago challenging the corruption conviction and the length of his prison term. A three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit heard arguments in the case in December 2013. In July 2015, the court unanimously vacated five of the corruption convictions, including his convictions for attempting to sell Barack Obama's vacant U.S. Senate seat after he was elected president, but affirmed the rest.

Judge Zagel re-imposed the same 14-year sentence he had imposed in 2011. Zagel acknowledged the suffering of Blagojevich's family and Blagojevich's good conduct in prison, but found that Blagojevich's corrupt conduct still warranted a 14-year sentence. Blagojevich's attorneys appealed to the 7th Circuit, but failed; then filed another appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 3, 2017. Meanwhile, unrepentant, Blagojevich continued to fight his conviction and sentence in the media. His wife Patti joined him in attracting press attention to his cause and criticism of the federal judiciary.

Blagojevich filed a petition officially asking President Trump for commutation of sentence on June 5, 2018. In August 2019, Trump commented to reporters that he was \"very strongly\" considering issuing a commutation.\n\n speaks about commuting Blagojevich on February 18, 2020. Video from .]]\nOn February 18, 2020, President Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year corruption sentence, wiping away the sentence but not the conviction. \"I don't know him very well, I've met him a couple of times, he was on for a short time on ''The Apprentice'' years ago, seemed like a very nice person, don't know him, but he served eight years in jail, there's a long time to go,\" Trump said to reporters. Some news sources noted that, in addition to ''The Apprentice'' connection, Trump and his organization had made contributions to Blagojevich's political campaigns, including his 2002 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nBlagojevich was released from prison that day, and flew home to Chicago that night. Speaking to reporters after his release, he stated, \"I'm profoundly grateful to President Trump, and I will be for as long as I live.\" He said Trump was \"a man who's not only tough and outspoken, strong, but he has a kind heart\", and proclaimed himself to be a \"Trump-ocrat\". On February 19, Blagojevich held a press conference at his home in Chicago's  neighborhood, where he remained defiant towards his conviction, describing himself as a \"political prisoner\", and promised to use his experience in prison to fix the broken criminal justice system.\n\nIllinois House GOP leader  criticized the President's decision to commute Blagojevich's sentence, stating that Blagojevich was \"rogue on steroids\" when he \"abused the office\" and that Trump was \"not concerned about the people of Illinois in November.\" The commutation was satirized by Chicago-based . Following the commutation, the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission found that Blagojevich had engaged in \"a pattern of dishonest and deceptive conduct\" and recommended his disbarment to the Illinois Supreme Court. On May 18, 2020, the Supreme Court of Illinois officially disbarred him.\n\nIn August of the same year, it was announced that Blagojevich would be the featured speaker at a fundraising event to benefit Republican state senate candidate Tom McCullagh.

Although Davis received endorsements from previous seat holder  and  leader ,  was the eventual winner of the primary.\n\nIn 2003, Davis sponsored legislation which was signed into law and forced  companies that do business in Illinois to publish all records they have on historical insuring of s as property through the state's Department of Insurance. This made available a wealth of  information to the descendants of slaves.  Illinois became the second state to implement such a law, after .\n\nDavis and Illinois Senator  co-sponsored a pair of successful bills in 2003.  The first, House Bill 223, mandated that all police interrogations on  investigations be recorded. The bill was motivated by the release of thirteen suspects convicted of murder and sentenced to death who'd later been exonerated by  evidence. Previously interrogations could only be recorded with the suspect's permission.  The second bill co-sponsored by the pair, Senate Bill 30, required police in Illinois to record the race of all people subjected to traffic stops, to provide information for efforts to eliminate  by police.\n\nIn 2004, Davis sponsored a bill to limit low-income household electricity or natural gas bills to no more than six percent of the household income. In 2005, Davis led the effort to secure funding for the Student Financial Assistance Outreach Center at  when it was threatened with closure. Negotiations with Illinois Governor  over his proposed budget for 2006 led to an agreement to fund the center in exchange for Democratic support on the budget. The center received $300,000.

She was also a member of the Appropriations-Higher Education Committee, Committee of the Whole, Financial Institutions Committee, Public Utilities Committee and the Registration and Regulation Committee.\n\n\n\nThe '''' reported on April 3, 2008 that Davis interrupted and criticized  activist  during his testimony before the House State Government Administration Committee in :\n\"I don't know what you have against , but some of us don't have much against him.  We look forward to him and his blessings ... I'm trying to understand the philosophy that you want to spread in the state of Illinois ... This is the land of  where people believe in God ... What you have to spew and spread is extremely dangerous ... It's dangerous for our children to even know that your philosophy exists ... Get out of that seat!  You have no right to be here!  We believe in something.  You believe in destroying!  You believe in destroying what this state was built upon.\"\n\nDavis' remarks drew great controversy. For example, the  said it was \"appalled by Davis's apparent belief that atheists and other non-religious individuals are not entitled to the same rights and liberties as other citizens.\" A director said, \"She is unfit to serve in her office, just as a representative who told a  or a  to 'get out of that seat' would be unfit to serve. If she does not resign, the Illinois House has an obligation to expel her.\" That same night,  journalist and commentator , on his show '''', declared Davis the \"Worst Person in the World,\" calling on Davis to either apologize or resign.\n\n\n\"Obviously, Assemblywoman Davis owes the witness and everybody in this country who believes in freedom of  an apology. And if she can't figure that out, she should resign and take her prejudice with her. She also needs to improve her own education. That phrase, 'this is the Land of Lincoln, where people believe in God'; Miss Davis said that in Springfield, where, when Lincoln first ran for  in 1846, the future great president was accused by his opponent of being an atheist. You not only spat on the fundamental American freedom to embrace religion, a religion or no religion, Assemblywoman Davis, but you also made a damn fool of yourself in the process. State Representative Monique Davis,  of Illinois, today's Worst Person in the World.\"\n\nOn Thursday, April 10, it was reported on '''', that Representative Davis called him (Sherman) personally to apologize for her remarks, and that he accepted her apology. She stated that she was angry because of the shooting deaths of two students earlier that day.\n\n\n\nIn August 2008, Blagojevich criticized Davis and nine other Chicago Democrats for, in his opinion, collecting dual salaries from the city of Chicago and from the state of Illinois as a lawmaker.

We collectively, from the grassroots, from below, can determine our own destiny.\"\n\nThe three \"people-power initiatives\" Ramirez-Rosa supports through his elected office are \"community-driven zoning and development\" - a local  process,  for the allocation of infrastructure improvement dollars, and a local  deportation defense network called the \"community defense committee.\" The \"community defense committee\" distributes immigration know-your-rights cards door-to-door, organizes know-your-rights trainings, and trains ward residents in how to engage in  to stop deportations.\n\nRamirez-Rosa has also called himself a \"movement elected official,\" stating his \"role is to be an organizer on the inside for those movements that are organizing people-power bases on the outside.\"\n\n\nIn 2016, Ramirez-Rosa worked with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression to introduce the  (CPA) ordinance. The ordinance sought to enact  of the Chicago Police Department via an all-elected civilian body. Ramirez-Rosa said the ordinance \"could be a model for true police accountability reform across the country.\" In 2021, Ramirez-Rosa led efforts to join the CPAC ordinance with a rival civilian oversight ordinance. The new ordinance – Empowering Communities for Public Safety – passed the Chicago City Council on July 21, 2021; Ramirez-Rosa was a chief sponsor. The passage of the ordinance led to the historic election of 66 civilians in the 2023 Chicago municipal election to serve as police district councilors.\n\nIn December 2017, Ramirez-Rosa was the sole member of the Chicago City Council to support the No Cop Academy campaign, a grassroots  effort to stop the city from spending $95 million on a new police academy building and instead spend that money on education, after school programs, job training, and social services. Ramirez-Rosa would explain his support of the No Cop Academy campaign as follows: \"police violence has cost Chicagoans $662 million in settlements since 2004, and CPD is funded to a tune of $4 million per day, $1.5 billion per year. Our nation has witnessed the magnitude of police crimes in the City of Chicago with the murders of  and . The Chicago Police Department is not lacking in resources, it is lacking in accountability and oversight. The $95 million that the City is projected to spend on this new cop academy should be invested in jobs, education, youth programs, and mental health services, not a new shooting range and swimming pool for police.”\n\nIn May 2018, after successfully delaying a vote on the new police academy, Ramirez-Rosa was expelled from the Chicago City Council's Latino Caucus. Ramirez-Rosa was later readmitted to the Latino Caucus after public outcry.\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of , Ramirez-Rosa helped dozens of  protesters recover their bikes which had been confiscated by the Chicago Police.\n\n\nIn 2020, in response to the , Ramirez-Rosa used his aldermanic office's resources to initiate and support neighborhood , and to target support to communities most impacted by the pandemic. Ramirez-Rosa's office distributed a bilingual newsletter to 7,000 ward households to provide residents with information on unemployment insurance and resources available to support them during the pandemic. Ramirez-Rosa joined with his socialist colleagues to call for a pandemic response that prioritized \"the most vulnerable.\" He also worked to expand Chicago's emergency rental assistance to undocumented Chicagoans. In December 2020, he helped bring the  High Road Kitchens program to Chicago, which provided grants to restaurants who committed to transition to a full minimum wage with tips on top.\n\n\nRamirez-Rosa has advocated for the raising of Chicago's  to a , and other measures in support of . He was a sponsor of the successful Fair Workweek ordinance to provide  with stability in their work schedules. He also sponsored the ordinance to raise Chicago's minimum wage to $15. Ramirez-Rosa also worked to create a municipal Office of Labor Standards to protect Chicago workers.\n\nOn October 4, 2018, Ramirez-Rosa was arrested at a  protest outside  global  in the . He was arrested alongside striking workers as they blocked the entrance to the building in an act of civil disobedience. The McDonald's workers were demanding a $15 wage and a . Ramirez-Rosa has spoken at several Fight for $15 demonstrations.\n\nIn 2017, Ramirez-Rosa sponsored and passed an ordinance to designate  in his ward as \" Way,\" in honor of the late  and founder of the  union. Parsons lived off Kedzie Avenue at 3130 N. Troy. At an honorary street sign unveiling event held on May 1, 2017, , Ramirez-Rosa said: \"The conditions Lucy and other workers were facing... are not too different from the conditions we're facing now. Today we honor Lucy Gonzalez Parsons because she taught us the way, she taught us that you don't take it sitting down, you don't live on your knees, you rise up and you fight back.\"\n\n\nIn 2016, Ramirez-Rosa sponsored a successful measure to ensure  persons had the right to access the public bathroom of their choice. During City Council debate on the ordinance, Ramirez-Rosa said: \"We must do everything we can to legislate love and to reject hate... we can legislate love because we can show that as a city, we will not discriminate against our trans-sisters and brothers, that we will allow equality to reign supreme when it comes to access to public accommodations.”\n\n\nThroughout his tenure, Ramirez-Rosa has served in several leadership roles on the Chicago City Council, including Chair of the Democratic Socialist Caucus, and as a board member of the Chicago City Council's Latino Caucus Foundation. From May to November 2023, he served as  's  and chair of the 's Committee on , Landmarks, and Building Standards.\n\nAs Johnson's Floor Leader, Ramirez-Rosa was tasked with whipping votes on the City Council for the mayor's agenda, including securing the passage of  legislation raising the minimum wage for tipped workers, doubling the number of guaranteed  days for Chicago workers, and placing a referendum on the ballot to create a dedicated revenue stream to address homelessness by raising the real estate transfer tax on properties that sell for over $1 million.\n\nOn Thursday, November 2, 2023, in the context of the , aldermen  and  called a special meeting of the Chicago City Council to place a referendum regarding Chicago's status as a  on the 2024 ballot, part of an effort to strip Chicago of its sanctuary city status. In his role as Johnson's Floor Leader, Ramirez-Rosa worked to prevent the meeting and the effort to strip Chicago of its sanctuary status from moving forward. Immediately following the adjournment of the meeting, alderman Ray Lopez claimed Ramirez-Rosa, in order to prevent a  from being present \"layed hands\", grabbed, \"manhandled\" and \"physically blocked\" alderwoman Emma Mitts from entering the council chambers. Over the weekend, Alderwoman Emma Mitts gave conflicting accounts of the incident to the Chicago City Council's Black Caucus, Mayor Johnson, and her pastor. After the Black Caucus called on Johnson to remove Ramirez-Rosa from his leadership positions, Ramirez-Rosa resigned as floor leader and from his committee chairmanship on Monday, November 6, 2023.\n\nWithin hours of Ramirez-Rosa's resignation from his leadership roles, CBS released video showing that Ramirez-Rosa did touch and block Mitts but “did not physically assault or manhandle Mitts”. The video showed \"Ramirez-Rosa briefly touching Mitts on the arm and standing in her path toward the door. A few seconds later, [Ramirez-Rosa] move[d] out of the way and [Mitts] enter[ed] council chambers.\" The video also showed Black Caucus Chair Stephanie Coleman \"walking by the incident without seeming to notice or feel the need to intervene.\" In response to Ramirez-Rosa's resignation from his Council leadership roles, more than 500 progressive leaders signed a statement in support of Ramirez-Rosa, stating \"Lopez and others clearly lied about the alleged incidents outside of Council Chambers, furthering the point that much of what has been said about Carlos’ behavior was a politically motivated hit job.\" Congresswoman  would issue her own statement in support of Ramirez-Rosa. On November 7, 2023, Ramirez-Rosa apologized to Mitts during a Chicago City Council meeting. Mitts accepted Ramirez-Rosa's apology and hugged and embraced him on the Council floor. Following the apology, a motion to censure Ramirez-Rosa failed, with Mitts and Mayor Johnson voting with the majority against censure.\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\nRamirez-Rosa served as 35th Ward  from 2016 to 2020. In 2019, he supported Anthony Joel Quezada to replace him as Democratic Committeeman in the March 2020 primary election.

He has a B.A. in  from , and a J.D. from .  Reboletti previously ran for  in the 23rd district in 2004, but lost in the Republican primary to . He currently serves as Addison Township Supervisor.\n\n\nOn January 26, 2007. freshman State Representative Dennis Reboletti filed House Bill  which proposed Schedule I classification for the psychoactive herb '''', including :\"the seeds thereof, any extract from any part of that plant, and every compound, [...] derivative, mixture, or preparation of that plant\".\n\nThe bill does not mention the active chemical constituent salvinorin A. Salvia expert  criticised this wording as being: \"absurdly broad in scope, for it implies that any substance extracted from Salvia divinorum (water, chlorophyll, whatever) would be treated as a Schedule I controlled substance under the proposed law.\".\n\nMarch 2007 news of the bill's passage on Reboletti's website alleged that Salvia is a\n\npowerful psychoactive plant which in appearance looks like marijuana but has the psychoactive properties of LSD.\n\nReboletti said,\n\nIt’s important that we in the legislature are proactive in protecting our children from highly addictive substances\nand\nFor a drug to be classified as a Schedule 1 substance signifies that it’s a highly dangerous and potentially lethal drug for its user. Hopefully, the passage of my bill will bring attention to \"Magic Mint\" and help law enforcement combat the future rise of this drug..\n\n'''' article references and other sources indicate however that Salvia does not look like marijuana. Its psychoactive properties are not like those of LSD, and that ''Salvia divinorum'' is not generally understood to be either addictive or toxic.\n\nBy May 22, 2007, HB0457 had received support from all 173 members in both bodies of the  majority . It was sent to the ,  (D), on June 20, 2007, and was signed into law on Friday August 17, 2007. The law came into effect on January 1, 2008..\n\nIn a statement given prior to the bill coming into effect Reboletti said,\n\nI've seen the argument to legalize marijuana. It is a gateway drug, like salvia could be a gateway drug,.\nand\nWe decided to move forward rather than waiting for someone to be killed because of it.\n\nA critical editorial was published by the Chicago Sun-Times on the eve of Reboletti's law coming into effect. It commented -\n\nLegislators must have been on something to zero in on this obscure organic substance ... The last time we checked, Illinois was not besieged by a salvia epidemic. We don't see the urgency in criminalizing a substance with no clear track record of causing people to act in a dangerous manner or hurt other people ... considering how overcrowded our prisons are with dangerous criminals, trolling around for more nonviolent drug offenders to punish is counterintuitive... Regulating use of, rather than banning salvia, would have been a more sober approach.\n\nOpponents of extremely prohibitive Salvia restrictions argue that such reactions are largely due to an inherent prejudice and a particular cultural bias rather than any actual balance of evidence, pointing out inconsistencies in attitudes toward other more toxic and addictive drugs such as alcohol and nicotine.] While not objecting to some form of regulatory legal control, in particular with regard to the sale to minors or sale of enhanced high-strength extracts, most Salvia proponents otherwise argue against stricter legislation.]\n\nAlcohol related financial contributions featured highly for Representative Dennis Reboletti's 2006 political campaign.

In light of this it is argued that Salvia divinorum could be better understood more positively as an  rather than pejoratively as a hallucinogen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n* - .

Do things big, do them fast, and do them all at once.\"\n\n\nVallas served as CEO of the  (CPS) from 1995 to 2001.  had been created by Mayor  after he convinced the Illinois State Legislature to place CPS under mayoral control.\n\nDuring his tenure at CPS, Vallas led an effort to reform the school system.  cited his work for raising test scores,\nbalancing the budget, instituting several new programs, including mandatory summer school, and after-school programs, and expanding alternative, charter, and magnet schools. Under Vallas's leadership, the use of  increased.\n\nVallas instated zero-tolerance discipline policies. He also expanded the number of non-neighborhood schools, which included selective enrollment high schools, charter schools, and some of the city's first public . He also launched thirteen  programs in the city's public high schools.\n\nIn 1995, CPS faced a projected 1999 deficit of $1.4 billion. To address that deficit, Vallas submitted a plan that he claimed would save $162 million by reducing 1,700 central office staffers, raising cash by selling 20 surplus properties, and eliminating a program, described as \"elaborate\", to network the district's computers. The plan also reallocated money earmarked for teacher pensions into a general operating budget. This reallocation was implemented. In later years, in tandem, a decrease in returns from the stock market and an increasing number of retirees would cause the CPS to be unable to make their full payments on time. This has been identified as an inciting incident for the subsequent $1 billion budget crisis, attributed largely to spiking pension payments in later years. $666 million in capital bonds that the district took out under Vallas's leadership are anticipated, as of 2023, to ultimately cost the city $1.5 billion when interest is factored in.\n\nIn June 2001, Vallas announced his resignation. His departure came two weeks after  resignation, the  . Both of their resignations came soon after several failing standardized testing scores eliminated the improvements to test scores that had been experienced over the previous two years. This loss of progress in test scores had angered Mayor Daley. Vallas's six-year tenure was greater than two-times the average tenure at the time for school superintendents in large U.S. cities.\n\nMany praised Vallas's tenure, crediting him with improving the school district's performance. Martha Woodall of '''' wrote in 2002 that, in Chicago, Vallas attained a reputation of being, a \"savvy, hard-working, blunt-speaking manager who insists on doing things his own way\". In a 2009 article published in the ''Peabody Journal of Education'', Elizabeth Useem wrote that, as CEO of CPS, Vallas, \"developed a reputation for being an energetic leader who could move quickly to carry out a far-reaching program of reform\". Among the criticisms detractors had of Vallas's style of leadership in Chicago were characterizations of him as failing to sufficiently collaborate with community groups and showing hostility towards those who gave criticism or questioned his decisions.\n\n\nIn July 2002, Vallas was appointed CEO of the . His appointment occurred six months after the state took over the school district. Vallas quickly moved to propose a reform agenda modeled after the actions he took in Chicago.\n\nAs CEO, he presided over the nation's largest experiment in  management of schools, with the management of over 40 schools turned over to outside for-profits, nonprofits, and universities beginning in Fall 2002. A 2007  study of Philadelphia's privatization found that the achievement gains in Philadelphia's privately managed schools were on average no different from district-wide gains, nor were they substantially greater than those of other low-achieving schools in the state. In particular, schools that stayed under district management but received additional resources similar to those managed by for-profit firms showed directly comparable increases in math.\n\nVallas converted the school district to a K–8 and 9–12 grade structure, eliminating nearly all city middle schools. Vallas oversaw a standardization of the district's curriculum. Vallas also had the district create new after school programs, as well as new Saturday school and summer school programs, which were mostly run by private companies such as  and  As superintendent, Vallas also undertook a program of new school facility construction and renovation of existing facilities. Vallas's tenure saw the establishment of an increased number of privately operated disciplinary schools and alternative schools. International Baccalaureate and  programs were expanded.\n\nVallas increased the number of International Baccalaureate programs in the city and the number of military academies in the district.\n\nThere was a gradual increase in standardized testing scores during Vallas's tenure. However, 11th grade scores remained poor. There was also an increase in schools meeting the Adequate Yearly Progress standards set by . Vallas failed to decrease the district's high  rate.\n\nVallas left the job in June 2007 to take a position in Louisiana. After Vallas departed, Thomas Brady served as interim CEO until  took office as CEO. Upon Vallas's departure, Vallas was described by '''' magazine as the, \"most effective Philadelphia schools chief in a generation\". A study published by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government concluded, \"the average student at schools managed by for-profit firms learned more in math than would be expected had the schools remained under district management\". However, a $73.3 million annual budget deficit had arisen towards the end of his tenure, which proved to be a source of criticism towards Vallas. Vallas's addition of a vast number of new initiatives and programs contributed to the district's budget shortfall. Vallas's five-year tenure was longer than the typical tenure length of school superintendents in U.S. cities.\n\n\nVallas signed a two-year contract (2007&ndash;2008) as  of the . He remained head of the Recovery School District through 2011. Vallas greatly increased the system's utilization of charter schools.\n\n\nIn December 2011, Vallas was hired by the  for , Connecticut, to become the interim superintendent of , effective January 1, 2012.\n\nIn June 2013, Vallas became the permanent superintendent of the Bridgeport Public Schools. In July,  Justice Barbara Bellis ordered Vallas removed from the position after he neglected to complete mandated coursework and certification. The  overturned the ruling of Bellis and ordered that Vallas be reinstated.\n\nVallas resigned on November 8, 2013, to run for .\n\n\nIn January 2017, Governor of Illinois  appointed Vallas to a vacant seat on the board of trustees of . Rauner's appointment of Vallas surprised some, as they had previously been political rivals. Rauner recommended that Vallas be made board chairman, despite the board having already elected a chairman months earlier. Instead, Vallas was made board secretary. Weeks after the appointment, Rauner recommended that Vallas be a crisis manager for the university. This was not done.\n\nAfter the university announced its intent to hire a new interim president and create and fill the position of chief administrative officer, Rauner recommended Vallas as his choice to serve as the interim president of . The board allowed Vallas to apply for the two positions, but only once he stepped down from his position on their board. Objections were raised to the prospect of Vallas serving as president, with criticisms including objections to Rauner's level of involvement in choosing Vallas and other criticism opposing appointing Vallas, who is , to lead a largely African-American university. In April, the university's board of trustees chose to appoint Rachel Lindsey as interim president, and appointed Vallas to serve as chief administrative officer. He served in the position during 2017 and 2018. In late-January 2018, after it became known that Vallas intended to leave the job to run for mayor of Chicago, the university's board dismissed him and expressed anger towards him, accusing him of using his position at the university to bolster his political prospects. Vallas had served only half the time his contract with the university specified.\n\n\nIn 2002, before being appointed CEO of Philadelphia's school district, Vallas was one of several applicants seeking appointment as Illinois superintendent of education.\n\nWhile working as superintendent in New Orleans, Vallas advised efforts to rebuild 's school system following the . His work in Haiti led actor  to request that Vallas join his J/P Haitian Relief Foundation CORE's board of directors, which Vallas accepted. Vallas also worked in post-earthquake school matters in Chile. His work in Chile and Haiti ultimately lasted several years.\n\nAfter the 2014 gubernatorial election, Vallas worked with the  and the  to develop a prison education program. He continued to work as a Bronner Group consultant.\n\nPaul Vallas is the co-chair of the Advisory Board for the National Education Support Network. According to them, Vallas was the lead consultant on \"a plan to create, finance and operationalize the first publicly funded school system in Haiti\". On Thursday, September 9, 2021, \"The Arkansas Board of Education&nbsp;... gave final approval to four open-enrollment charter schools to begin operations in 2022 and 2023.\" Vallas was \"one of the chief planners\" for the Arkansas Military and First Responders Academy in Pulaski County, Arkansas. That school was proposed to the Arkansas Department of Education on March 31, 2020, by Rick W. Mills of the National Education Support Network, with a smaller enrollment size than it would eventually be planned to accept, with 800 students being enrolled as opposed to the intended cap of 600 students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing his tenure at CPS, Vallas ran for  as a .  Vallas placed second in the Democratic  in March 2002, losing narrowly to then-U.S. Congressman  and finishing ahead of former state attorney general .\n\nFormer congressman , a conservative Democrat, campaigned on behalf of Vallas. Before launching his gubernatorial campaign, Vallas had been asked by Poshard, who had considered running himself, to run in the Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial primary as Poshard's co-endorsed candidate. Vallas wasn't interested in running for lieutenant governor. Months later, Vallas reflected on this decision by asking, \"does anyone really know what the lieutenant governor does?\" In addition to Poshard's support, Vallas also received the endorsements of the s of the '''' and the ''''.\n\nThe general chairman of Vallas's campaign was .  served as the campaign's communications director.\n\n\nDuring his tenure as superintendent in Louisiana, he floated the possibility of running for office back in Illinois, but ultimately did not pursue either race. On April 28, 2008 he appeared before the  and on Chicago news shows discussing a possible run for . In February 2009, Vallas gave an interview to  in the '''' and stated that he planned to return to  in 2009 and run as a  for  in the . Vallas went as far as forming an exploratory committee for such a prospective candidacy. On June 11, 2009, Vallas announced that he would not be a candidate for president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2010. Vallas stated that he could not \"begin a political campaign while trying to finish what he startedrebuild the school system there in the aftermath of \".\n\n\n\nIn November 2013, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn tapped Vallas to be his running mate in the 2014 election after incumbent lieutenant governor  chose to run for comptroller instead of seeking reelection. In his announcement, Quinn praised Vallas saying \"he's never been shy about fighting for education, reform and opportunities for working people\". Quinn's choice of Vallas was seen as surprising by many, including U.S. Senator , who nonetheless called Vallas his friend. During the campaign, Vallas played the role of the campaign's \"attack dog\", heavily criticizing Bruce Rauner.\n\nQuinn and Vallas lost the election to the Republican ticket of Bruce Rauner and . During Vallas's 2023 mayoral campaign, Quinn endorsed U.S. Representative 's campaign over his campaign at first, however eventually endorsed Vallas in the run-off election. \n\nIn April 2023, at a rally for 's mayoral campaign,   and  Josina Morita, who are both of  ancestry and who both worked as interns for Quinn 2014's campaign, claimed to a crowd that, \"every single weekend, at a campaign event or a parade, [Vallas] would confuse us\", thereby alleging that Vallas had had difficulty telling the two  interns apart.\n\n\n\n]]\nIn March 2018, Vallas formally filed to become a candidate in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election.\n\nWhen he entered the race, Vallas was seen as a potentially strong opponent to incumbent , seeking reelection at the time. In September, Emanuel dropped out of the race, and the field for mayor grew, with many more high-profile candidates entering the race. After Emanuel withdrew his planned candidacy, a large number of prominent political figures adjoined the field running for mayor of Chicago. Among the contenders to enter the race at this point was Gery Chico, Vallas's one-time political ally with whom he had previously overseen the Chicago Public Schools. Vallas had previously endorsed Chico for mayor in . Despite this history, Vallas did not hesitate to criticize Chico as a mayoral opponent.\n\nVallas staked a large part of his candidacy on his record as head of Chicago Public Schools, arguing that he helped to turn around the school system and that his leadership left the system in better shape. Vallas claimed that the Chicago Public Schools were healthier under his leadership than they were in 2019.  rated this claim as \"mostly true\".\n\nAs a candidate, Vallas pledged to combat political corruption in Chicago's City Hall.\n\nVallas was endorsed by Deborah Lynch, former president of the . , chairman of the , was a major campaign donor to Vallas. Vallas also received a rare mayoral endorsement from the Chicago Republican Party. Chicago Republican Party Chair Chris Cleveland called Vallas the \" of 13 evils\". Vallas welcomed the endorsement, commenting, \"This is a non-partisan election and I'm running for mayor to represent all Chicagoans. I've traveled to every ward and met with every constituency. The crisis that Chicago faces affects all citizens. I thank the Republican committee for their confidence in my candidacy.\" Former governor , a Republican, commented in an interview that, of those running, Vallas, \"might make the best mayor\".\n\nVallas's campaign sent unsolicited text messages. The campaign employed -based firm Link2Tek to accomplish this. In mid-January 2019, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Vallas campaign, alleging that it had violated the , which prohibits calling or texting a person using an automatic telephone dialing system without their consent. Vallas accused the lawsuit of being, \"a dirty trick\" orchestrated by the \"political machine\". A motion by Link2Tek's (a co-defendant in the lawsuit) to dismiss the lawsuit was denied in August 2020.\n\nAs the election came close, despite the race being highly competitive, outlets such as '''' and '''' magazine did not consider Vallas among the top contenders to advance to a likely . Ultimately, in the first round of the election, Vallas placed ninth out of fourteen candidates, receiving 30,236 votes (5.43% of the votes cast).

Vallas was a critic of the Lightfoot administration over what he characterized as her lack of accountability amidst a rise in crime and violence in the city.\n\nVallas's campaign staff included a number of nationally prominent consultants, including , who served as senior strategist and media advisor, and pollster .\n\nVallas centered his candidacy on the issue of crime. He promised that he would extend both the length of the school day and the school year. He also pledged that he would give parents \"100% choice\" over what schools their children attend.\n\nThe month that he launched his campaign, Vallas appeared at a fundraising event for Awake IL, a political not-for-profit that had been criticized for its anti- rhetoric. In August 2022, Vallas condemned the group saying \"I am a lifelong Democrat who has spent my entire adult life fighting hateful rhetorical and hateful groups.\" His claim of being a \"lifelong Democrat\" was called into question by some, who pointed to campaign contributions from prominent Republican donor , and to  records listing Vallas as having voted in the  Republican Party . Reporter Gregory Pratt later claimed that the Chicago Board of Elections had said that Vallas had not voted in the Republican primary and that the records that showed him as having done so were due to a \"coding error\".\n\n\n\nVallas was the only  candidate on the ballot in the 2023 mayoral election. Seven of the other candidates were , while one was . Edward Robert McClelland of  remarked that his being the sole White candidate meant that, unlike in the 2019 mayoral election, \"[Vallas] doesn't have to share that constituency with , Jerry Joyce, or .\" McClelland also regarded Vallas to be running as a police-friendly candidate. Similarly, Justin Kaufman of '''' opined that Vallas is \"the candidate most likely to court the police and firefighter vote\". Vallas received the endorsement of Chicago's  (FOP) lodge, which serves as the city's .\n\nIn addition to being endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, Vallas was also endorsed in the election's first round by  Local 2 and the s of both the '''' and ''''. Also endorsing Vallas were Chicago aldermen  , , and .\n\nVallas was often viewed as being either a  or politically moderate candidate, especially when compared to other candidates in the election. Vallas also received significant campaign donations from sources considered politically conservative and aligned with the Republican Party. Vallas was criticized by opponents for holding perceived conservative political positions, in particular allegedly opposing . Other candidates in the 2023 race pointed to a 2009 interview in which he declared himself \"more of a Republican than a Democrat because, fundamentally, I oppose abortion\" as well as stating that \"If I were to run for office again, I would run as a Republican\" and that he would \"probably register as a Republican in the next primary\". Nonetheless, in the same interview Vallas had described himself as \"personally pro-choice\". Vallas disputed the anti-abortion characterization and asserted that his words were taken out of context. Vallas pointed to past endorsements from the pro-choice groups  and Personal PAC during his 2002 gubernatorial and 2014 lieutenant gubernatorial campaigns.\n\nBy early February, polls showed Vallas to be among the s. Around the same time, Vallas received the endorsement of the  of the ''''. Soon after, Vallas faced allegations that his permanent residence was actually in  rather than Chicago after an investigative report by  based upon reported tax filings. This raised questions regarding Vallas's legal eligibility to hold the office of mayor of Chicago. Vallas responded that he lived in Chicago, while his wife lived in Palos Heights to care for her elderly parents. On February 23, the ''Chicago Tribune'' news bureau released a report on an investigation of Vallas's Twitter account, showing that it had liked several tweets that \"used racist language, supported controversial police tactics like '' or insulted the mayor in personal terms\". Vallas denied liking the tweets and claimed that his account had been hacked.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, Vallas won the plurality in the first round of the election, receiving 32.91% of the vote, causing a runoff election where he would face runner-up Brandon Johnson. Among the areas where Vallas saw his greatest levels of support was the city's downtown, as well as parts of the city’s northwest and southwest sides that had large working-class White populations. Some analysts believe that Vallas benefited greatly from staking out a \"tough-on-crime\" stance amid widespread concerns among Chicagoans about crime.\n\n\nFour candidates eliminated in the first round endorsed Vallas in the runoff: businessman , Alderman , Alderman , and activist .  In addition to the four incumbent aldermen who had endorsed Vallas ahead of the first round of the election, Vallas received the endorsements of many more incumbent aldermen (including the aforementioned King and Sawyer). A number of these came from several \"pro-police\" Hispanic ward aldermen.\n at a runoff mayoral forum at , March 2023]]\nSome individuals and unions that had endorsed Lightfoot in the first round endorsed Vallas in the runoff.

Vallas harshly criticized the remarks as \"absolutely irresponsible\" and said “they have no place in this campaign.\" \n\nVallas accused Johnson of lacking \"substance\" and of lacking a significant political record. Vallas also campaigned on lowering crime, while characterizing Johnson as wanting to \"\".\n\nContinuing the charge prominently led by Lightfoot and García in the first round of the election, Johnson characterized Vallas as a Republican masquerading as a Democrat. Johnson criticized Vallas for ties to Republican Party organizations and figures and to conservative causes. In the first runoff debate, Johnson remarked \"Chicago cannot afford Republicans like Paul Vallas”, pointing to 2009 remarks in which Vallas had expressed opposition to  and declared himself \"more of a Republican than a Democrat\". In response to this line of criticism, Vallas continued to proclaim himself a \"lifelong Democrat\", citing his previous 2002 gubernatorial and 2014 lieutenant gubernatorial campaigns as a Democrat. Johnson also attacked Vallas as having hurt Chicago Public Schools' finances during his tenure as CEO.\n\nVallas significantly out-fundraised Johnson, raising $18 million. Vallas's campaign spent almost $17 million, outspending Johnson by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1.\n\nAfter Johnson was projected to have defeated him, Vallas .\n\nAfter the election, Vallas filed a lawsuit accusing Chimaobi Enyia (the former head of the Illinois Liquor Control Commission and brother of 2019 Chicago mayoral candidate ) of  the campaign of $680,000. The lawsuit claimed that the campaign had given the money to Enyia for Black voter outreach efforts.\n\n\nIn 2020, Vallas served as an unpaid consultant to Chicago's  police union during contract negotiations with the city of Chicago, playing a role in the negotiations. The Union's head, , touted Vallas's presence at negotiation with assisting the police union's bargaining.\n\n\n\nDuring his 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Vallas opposed the  of  and was in favor of banning s.

Vallas also opposed a proposed casino in , citing that gambling should only be permitted to advance economic development. He also opposed raising the state income tax, claiming it would be wrong amid an economic downturn.\n\nDuring his 2002 gubernatorial campaign and much of his political career, Vallas has positioned himself as supportive of . In a 2009 interview, Vallas said he opposed abortion but also declared himself to be \"personally pro-choice\".\n\nDuring his 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Vallas opposed using public subsidies to renovate  (a stadium in Chicago). He also opposed the proposed renovation design and was against the possible selling of  for the stadium. During his 2023 mayoral campaign, Vallas stated that he believes it is too late to persuade the  football team to remain at Soldier Field amid plans by the Bears to build a new stadium in . He also opposed a $2.2 billion renovation of the stadium floated by Mayor Lightfoot.\n\nIn his 2023 mayoral campaign, Vallas campaigned as \"tough-on-crime\".\n\n\nVallas married his wife, Sharon Vallas, in 1984.

He served in the Illinois House from 1971 to 2021. He represented the 27th District from 1971 to 1983, the 30th district from 1983 to 1993, and the 22nd district from 1993 to 2021.

Madigan's  network in state and local bodies was extensive.\n\nOn January 11, 2021, Madigan announced he would be suspending his effort to be elected to a nineteenth term as Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, and on January 13, he was replaced by fellow  .  Madigan announced that he would resign as state representative effective at the end of February. On February 18, he announced that his resignation would take effect that same day.\n\nOn March 2, 2022, Madigan was indicted on federal racketeering charges. He is set to stand on  on October 8, 2024.\n\n\nMadigan's father, Michael, was \"a very strong , he was a product of the  ... He carried with him very strong feelings in favor of many of the enactments of the .\" Michael J. Flynn was the , and also the Democratic  of Chicago's 13th , an unpaid, political-party leadership position. Madigan's father was a  in the 13th Ward and worked in the Cook County Clerk's office, where he befriended a young , who would later succeed Flynn as County Clerk prior to running for mayor of Chicago. Madigan later characterized the relationship between his father and Richard J. Daley as \"political friends.\" The elder Michael Madigan later worked for 25 years as the 13th Ward superintendent for the City of Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation.\n\nMadigan was born on April 19, 1942, and was raised in the  neighborhood of . Madigan graduated from Saint Adrian's Elementary School,  on the west side of Chicago, and the . In 1965, while a first-year law student at , Madigan purchased a membership in the Lake Shore Club and introduced himself to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley as Michael Madigan's son. Within months, at Madigan's father's request, Mayor Daley appointed Madigan to a summer job with the city law department between his first and second years of law school. Madigan also met Daley's son, , while both were law students. Madigan's father suffered a heart attack at age 58, and a fatal heart attack at age 60, in 1966. Madigan graduated from Loyola Law School in 1967. Madigan and  worked together in the city law department. Madigan and Richard M. Daley were both delegates to the 1969-70 Illinois  (which wrote the current , adopted after Illinois voters approved it in the ), and became good friends.\n\nIn 1972, Madigan founded the private law firm of Madigan and Getzendanner with Vincent J. \"Bud\" Getzendanner Jr., a fellow Loyola law graduate, one year his senior. In 1976, Madigan married Shirley Murray, a divorced law firm receptionist with a young daughter, , whom Madigan ; Lisa later became  in 2003.\n\n\nMadigan joined Chicago Mayor  in endorsing Alderman  in the  Democratic primary race for , over Madigan's friend .\n\nIn 1986 Madigan urged  to enter the Democratic primary for Illinois governor. Hartigan withdrew and Stevenson won the primary and was defeated by  for the second time.\n\n\nIn 1969 the 13th Ward precinct captains elected Madigan their , making him, at age 27, the youngest ward committeeman in Chicago at the time. Madigan's ward organization has been called the most disciplined in Chicago.\n\n\n\nIn 1998 the Illinois Democratic Party's Central Committee elected Madigan chair of the . Madigan succeeded his protégé and former chief of staff, Gary LaPaille. Madigan fired the state party staff, closed its headquarters in the  in Chicago, and moved it to , to the same office building as his campaign finance committee staff.\n\nMadigan's position as the Democratic Party Chair was challenged by  during the March 2018 Democratic primary for state central committeeman of the 3rd Congressional District.\n\nOn February 22, 2021, Madigan resigned as chairman.\n\n\n\nIn November 1970 Madigan was elected to represent the 22nd District in the Illinois House of Representatives. The district, on Chicago's southwest side in the area surrounding , has recently become majority Hispanic.\n\n\n\nMadigan was Speaker of the Illinois House from 1983 to 2021, with the exception of 1995&ndash;1997 when  took control of the Illinois House and  of  became Speaker. Madigan recruited candidates who appealed to south suburban Chicago voters and the Illinois House Democratic Majority  he controls spent $272,000 in six south suburban races. Democrats won back nine seats in the Illinois House in the elections of November 1996, regained a majority, and Madigan resumed the Speaker's role and held it until January 2021. He is the longest-serving state House speaker in  history.\n\nBeginning in the 1980 , and except in the 1990s, Madigan was the chief mapmaker of the legislative districts of the  and the  in  and during  he designs the Illinois House districts to increase his majority.\n\nAfter 2002when Democrats took control of all branches of the state governmentMadigan feuded with leading Democrats Governor  and Senate President .\n\nSome political observers were critical of the level of control Madigan came to hold over Illinois politics, describing him as the state's .\n\nIn 2016, Madigan was the subject and namesake of a documentary made by the . The documentary was widely criticized as overly partisan and raised ethical concerns after individuals featured in the movie claimed they were not told the nature of their interviews. In May 2019 Madigan supported a bill to change Illinois's tax rate from a  to a graduated tax rate and sponsored a bill to fine businesses for profiting from , , or  activities.\n\nIn January 2021, Madigan announced he would be suspending his campaign for Speaker of the Illinois House after it became apparent that he would not receive the 60 votes necessary to win. On January 13, the Illinois House voted to instead elect  to the Speakership, making him the first African American to hold that position. A federal corruption investigation related to Madigan's conduct continued despite his ouster as speaker.\n\n\nMadigan and Blagojevich clashed over Blagojevich's proposals for increased state spending. Blagojevich blamed the 2007 budget crisis on Madigan, releasing a statement that said, \"The way to be able to finally get budgets that achieve the objective of health care and education for families is to get Mr. Madigan to be a Democrat again and stop being a  Republican.\" Madigan refused to meet with Blagojevich for more than two months after Blagojevich introduced the budget; rather than the proposed $5 billion in increased spending, he recommended $1 billion, funded by the ending of a tax break. When talks stalled, Madigan invited the entire House to accompany him to budget negotiations.\n\nMadigan opposed Blagojevich's proposed gross receipts tax in 2007. He said the tax was \"\" and would hurt the poor, who are \"the least able in our society to take on additional costs.\"\n\nIllinois senior Senator  said in 2008 that he received many constituent complaints about the dispute between Blagojevich and Madigan, with letter writers wanting him to step in to negotiate. Durbin said the subject was also often talked about in the  in , among the Illinois congressional delegation. Durbin joked that he would rather go to  to mediate than .\n\nThe '''' statehouse bureau reporter of 13 years, Dave McKinney, said of Madigan's style as Speaker:\n\n\n\nThe relationship between Blagojevich and Madigan hit its low in October 2007, when Blagojevich fired Bronwyn Rains, wife of Madigan's chief of staff Timothy Mapes, from her position of psychologist with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. Blagojevich said he based this on Rains's educational background. She had worked for the department for 24 years with no prior record of problems; one observer called the fallout \"nuclear war.\"\n\nSenate Republican Leader  and House Republican Leader  often met with Madigan, his Senate counterpart at the time , and Blagojevich in an attempt to referee disputes. In August 2008, Blagojevich stated that House Democrats who held City of Chicago jobs were fearful of voting in favor of his 2008 capital bill because they thought Madigan might be able to get them fired.  Blagojevich told reporters:\n\nThey fear their leader, Mr. Madigan, and if Mike Madigan tells them to vote a certain way, they will tell you privately, and I've had these discussions with a couple of state reps, one of whom said, 'I'm afraid if I vote for the jobs bill I'll be fired from my job at Streets and Sanitations . I'm afraid I'll lose my job.'\n\n\nRepresentative  told the newspaper that Blagojevich had told House Democrats he was referring to . When contacted, D'Amico said that Blagojevich had asked him if he feared losing his job with the City of Chicago's water department, at which point D'Amico said that he had been in a  for 26 years and could not be fired easily, and instead opposed the capital bill because Mayor  opposed it.\n\nOn December 15, 2008, Madigan announced that he was taking steps to initiate impeachment proceedings against Blagojevich after the governor was arrested on charges of conspiracy and fraud. He named  Majority Leader  to chair the 21-member House committee on impeachment. After the committee reported, Madigan presided over the House deliberations which unanimously voted for the first impeachment of an Illinois governor. Subsequently, the  tried and removed Blagojevich from office, also by a unanimous vote.\n\n\n\nMadigan refused to testify in the  over his advocacy for more than 40 applicants to the . Governor  appointed a commission, to be led by retired Judge , to investigate attempts by lawmakers and others to influence admissions of unqualified candidates (whose relatives had given money to Madigan, other lawmakers, and the state Democratic Party, which Madigan chairs) at the state's largest university. The August 6, 2009, Admissions Review Commission report stated that the university's top officials (trustees, president, chancellor) were the most culpable, because they should have refused the lawmakers' requests, although he also said a separate commission should be established by Quinn and/or the legislature to look into possible misconduct by Madigan and others.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2013 it was reported that Madigan had sought to use his influence to secure  hiring and promotion at the  commuter rail agency for two of his supporters. Metra CEO Alex Clifford rejected these requests, and alleges that the agency's board sought his resignation as a result.\n\nIn the wake of this scandal five Metra board members resigned, but Madigan denied violating any ethics rules. An investigation by the Legislative Inspector General found that Madigan \"should have realized, given his influential position, that by making the [personnel] requests at the conclusion of meetings with Metra officials to discuss funding and other legislative issues, he would be creating reciprocal expectations.\"\n\nMore than 400 current or retired state and local government employees have strong political ties to Madigan, according to a 2014 investigation by the ''''. The former Bureau of Electricity in the Streets and Sanitation Department of the City of Chicago was called \"Madigan Electric\" by political insiders. Madigan recommended at least 26 individuals for jobs at Metra from 1983 to 1991.\n\n\n\nMadigan has admitted that he is more likely to return phone calls from campaign contributors than from non-contributors.\n\nOf all the current sitting Democratic  members, Madigan has received the most campaign contributions from . Between 2002 and 2012, he received $670,559. This sum includes:\n* $56,114 from \n* $50,000 from \n* $63,600 from \n* $161,000 from the \n* $135,000 from the \n* $204,845 from the \nOn January 1, 2016, the Chicago Tribune reported that Madigan \"has been on a fundraising tear, courtesy of a quirk in state campaign finance law that allows him to amass multiple five-figure contributions from the same donor into four funds he controls.\" In 2015, Madigan raised more than $7 million. Over 68% of the money that Madigan raised in 2015 came from trial lawyers, law firms, and organized labor unions.\n\nIllinois created its first limit on campaign contributions for the legislature in 2009, but the law allowed politicians to raise money for various campaign funds for their political parties and caucuses. Madigan controls four different campaign fundraising organizations: Friends of Michael J Madigan, the Democratic Majority fund, the Southwest Side 13th Ward fund and the Democratic Party of Illinois account. Additionally, over the past 15 years, Madigan raised more than $658,000 in donations from the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association (ITLA) Legislative PAC.\n\n\nIn early 2011 leading Illinois Democratic lawmakers and Governor Pat Quinn agreed to raise the Illinois state income tax from 3 to 5.25 percenta 75% increase. At the time, it was estimated that this would bring in about $7.5 billion a year. The tax increase would mean that a married couple with two kids earning $80,000 a year combined would pay an extra $1,620 in taxes. Democratic leaders said the plan would pull the state out of its $15 billion budget hole. They promised the tax hike would last just four years, and then fall to 3.75 percent.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014 the Illinois state income tax rate was 5 percent. On January 1, 2015, the tax rate was reduced from 5 percent to 3.75 percent, creating a shortfall in revenue of $2.7 billion starting FY 2015. Madigan has said that he would rather increase income taxes than sales taxes. On other occasions, he has introduced budgets that raise taxes in Illinois.\n\n\nOn May 25, 2016, Madigan introduced a budget plan that increased spending and \"set the state on autopilot for the next year\", according to the Chicago Tribune. Madigan's plan allocated $700 million more in funds to public schools. The $700 million would be doled out to poorer school districts such as Chicago Public Schools.\n\nThe Illinois Office of Management and Budget said that the tax rate for an average family in Illinois would have to go up by $1,000 to pay for Madigan's plan. That amounts to an increase of the income tax rate to 5.5 percent. Governor  said that the budget was \"the biggest unbalanced budget in Illinois history.\"\n\nMadigan's plan passed the Illinois House of Representatives on May 25 by a vote of 63 in favor and 53 opposed. The Republican leader in the Illinois House, Jim Durkin, said the bill was \"absolutely the biggest joke.\" Among those opposed were seven Democratic representatives. The seven were targeted for defeat in the fall 2016 campaigns.\n\nMadigan's tax plan proposed spending $47.5 billion for fiscal year 2017. The state estimated that it would bring in approximately $40.5 billion in revenue, meaning that Madigan's budget spends around $7 billion more than the state would have available through tax revenue. The , a conservative think tank, estimated that the state would need to increase people's income tax from 3.75 to 5.5 percent in order to make up for Madigan's budget gap. The think tank estimated that the increase would amount to around $1,000 on average per family in Illinois.\n\n\nIn December 2015 the state of Illinois had had no budget in place for over five months. On December 9, at the City Club in Chicago, Madigan publicly said he thought the state income tax should increase to \"at least 5 percent to balance the state's out-of-whack finances\".\n\nThe ''Chicago Tribune'' wrote, \"In doing so, Madigan potentially gave new life to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's argument that Democrats are to blame for the stalemate in Springfield because they're intent on only raising taxes to dig out of the state budget deficit.\"\n\nMadigan's exact words were, \"A good place to begin, good place to begin would be the level we were at before the income tax expired. ... And starting there, you can go in whatever direction you want to go.\"\n\n\nOne of Madigan's ideas to raise taxes is to pass a state constitutional amendment that would raise taxes on \"millionaires to pay for public schools.\"\n\nMadigan also has a plan for a graduated rate increase. State representative Lou Lang, a deputy under Madigan, formally introduced Madigan's proposal that would change how Illinois taxpayers are taxed at the state level. Instead of being taxed a flat rate, people would be taxed at a graduated rate, with the rate increasing for higher incomes.\n\nThe Tax Foundation released a report in early 2016, using figures from 2011, that showed that Illinois had the fifth-highest tax burden in the United States. Illinois had the second-highest burden when compared to other states in the midwest. Under Madigan's proposal, those figures would change: Illinois would have the fourth-highest and highest tax burden in the U.S. and midwest, respectively. In 2012, Illinois' tax burden was the second highest in the midwest, after Wisconsin, but before Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker passed tax cuts.\n\n\n\nMadigan was instrumental in the passage of SB-1, a plan that amended state employee pension plans by drastically reducing the constitutionally protected benefits of Illinois state employees in retirement. The Illinois Supreme Court ultimately found these legislative changes to be unconstitutional.\n\nAs the Illinois Supreme Court ruling stated: \"These modifications to pension benefits unquestionably diminish the value of the retirement annuities the members ... were promised when they joined the pension system. Accordingly, based on the plain language of the Act, these annuity-reducing provisions contravene the pension protection clause's absolute prohibition against diminishment of pension benefits and exceed the General Assembly's authority\".\n\n\nIn October 2022, under a deferred prosecution with the , AT&T admitted that it arranged for payments to Illinois House Representative , an ally of Madigan, in order to unlawfully influence and reward Madigan's vote in 2017 on legislation that would eliminate AT&T's so-called \"Carrier of Last Resort\" obligation to provide landline telephone service to all Illinois residents, which was expected to save the company millions of dollars. Madigan also helped to defeat an amendment to a bill that became law in 2018 regarding fees for small cell tower attachments that would have been harmful to AT&T's interests. Former AT&T Illinois President Paul La Schiazza, who is set to go on trial in September 2024 for the alleged bribery scheme, described AT&T's  relationship with Madigan in an email to an AT&T employee as \"the friends and family plan.\"\n\n\n\nOn June 6, 2019, Bishop  issued a decree barring Madigan and Senate President  from presenting themselves to receive the Eucharist on account of their role in passing the Reproductive Health Act, which removes spousal consent and waiting periods for abortions. While singling out Madigan and Cullerton specifically, Paprocki also asked that other legislators who voted for the bill not present themselves for Communion either, saying that they had \"cooperated in evil and committed grave sin.\" Madigan said that Paprocki had warned him that he would be forbidden to take the sacrament if he permitted the House to debate and vote on the measure.\n\n\n\nOn February 18, 2021, Madigan announced through a letter to the Speaker of the Illinois House that he would be resigning from the state representative post which will be effective at the end of February.\n\n\n\nMadigan was founder and continues as  of the law firm Madigan and Getzendanner, specializing in corporate real estate property tax appeals, which has been accused of profiting from Madigan's position and power. Getzendanner and four other staff attorneys handle the tax appeals, while Madigan brings in clients. In 2008 Madigan and Getzendanner represented 45 of the 150 most valuable buildings in downtown Chicago, more than any other property tax appeal firm, and more than twice as many as the second-highest. Clients include the  and the . From 2006 to 2008 in , Madigan and Getzendanner received the largest reductions for their clients of any tax appeal law firm. Venues for property tax appeals law firms in Cook County include hearings before the County , the County Board of Review, and the County courts. Judges in Illinois are elected in partisan elections, and Madigan, by his Democratic Party leadership roles as committeeman and state chairman, is one of the main persons involved in slating judicial candidates.\n\nAfter the death of veteran 45th Ward committeeman and longtime chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party Thomas G. Lyons in January 2007, Cook County Democrats met in Chicago on February 1 to fill the vacancy. Madigan nominated , a former Illinois State Representative, then a commissioner on the Cook County Board of Review. Cook County Democrats elected Berrios their new chairman. Madigan political workers aided Berrios's 2010 campaign for . Berrios is registered as a  to  and advocates for issues including expanding video . Berrios lobbies Madigan in Springfield, while the Assessor is critical to the lucrative commercial real-estate tax appeals practices of law firms, including Madigan's. \"Even by Illinois's loose conflict of interest standards, the obviousness of the Madigan-Berrios connection is stupefying,\" wrote '''' in 2013. Berrios went on to lose to  in the Democratic primary for Cook County Assessor in March 2018. Kaegi then won the general election.\n\n\nMadigan and his wife, Shirley, have four children. His oldest daughter, , served as  from 2003 to 2019. Madigan is not Lisa's biological father: she was born Lisa Murray to Shirley and criminal attorney Joel Murray. They divorced and Shirley married Madigan when Lisa was 10 years old. Lisa changed her name when she was 18 and was formally adopted in her 20s. Shirley is the head of the . Madigan's son-in-law Jordan Matyas (married to Madigan's daughter Tiffany Madigan) is the chief lobbyist for , a deputy chief overseeing their Government Affairs Department.\n\nIn 2002 Madigan helped Lisa garner more campaign contributions in her run for Illinois Attorney General than even the candidates for governor that year. At one point, Lisa Madigan's $1.2 million raised was more than all the attorney general candidates in 1998 had raised, combined.\n\nAllegations of misconduct in campaign contributions arose during the 2002 campaign. Madigan was accused of using taxpayer dollars for political purposes. His staffers made numerous visits at public expense to contested Illinois House districts in the winter and spring before the November 2000 election. The Republican gubernatorial candidate, , suggested that Madigan should resign. Lisa Madigan was running for Attorney General that year and called the allegations baseless. Her opponent in the race called on her to pay back taxpayer-paid bonuses her father had paid staffers before they departed to work on his daughter's campaign. A federal investigation into one of Lisa Madigan's political endorsements ensued after Madigan allegedly contacted a union boss in Chicago shortly before the union endorsed Madigan's daughter for the post, but nothing came of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* at the 98th Illinois General Assembly\n**Previous sessions: , , , , \n* of the \n* \n* at OurCampaigns.com\n* profile\n* at Illinois House Democrats\n* featured articles at the ''''\n* collection of news and information related to Michael Madigan published by the  '''' and its partners\n* ongoing coverage of Madigan at the ''''\n* article archive at the ''''\n* article archive at the ''''\n* audio, video and article archive at  Chicago\n* video and article archive at  Chicago\n* biography on the website of , Madigan's law firm\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Moore was first elected to  as the alderman for the 49th ward, which includes the majority of  and portions of , in 1991. Moore won re-election six times, before losing to challenger  in .\n\n\n\n\nMoore was born in Chicago in 1958 and later moved to Evanston, where he graduated from  in 1976. He graduated from  in  with a B.A in 1980 and earned a J.D. from  in 1984. From 1984 to 1991, Moore worked as an attorney in the City of Chicago's Department of Law, first in the department's Appeals Division and later in the department's Affirmative Litigation Division, where he worked to recover millions of dollars on behalf of the City's taxpayers.\n\n\n, 49th ward alderman  was elected , creating a vacancy in the  until the 1991 municipal elections. Chicago's Mayor appoints replacements to fill short-term vacancies in the City Council. Orr supported Moore as his replacement. Mayor  appointed Robert Clarke, a law associate of  State Representative Lee Preston, the 49th ward Democratic . Moore was among the challengers to Clarke in the February, 1991 municipal elections. No candidate received a majority of the votes, requiring a run-off between the top two, Moore and Clarke, in April, 1991. Orr was Moore's campaign chairman. On April 2, 1991, Moore was elected alderman. Of eight incumbent alderman who were originally appointed by Daley to fill vacancies, Clarke was the only one to fail to win re-election that year.\n\n\nMoore won re-election in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011 and in . In , Moore lost election to .\n\nHe was chairman of the City Council Committee on Housing and Real Estate, which oversees City housing policy and all transactions involving City-owned real estate. Moore also served most recently on the following City Council committees: Budget and Government Operations; Education and Child Development; Finance; Health and Environmental Protection; Human Relations; Special Events, Cultural Affairs and Recreation; and Rules and Ethics.\n\n\nMoore was a pioneer in the effort to bring community policing to Chicago. The Chicago community policing strategy involves residents and other City agencies working together to prevent crime and improve the quality of life in all of Chicago's neighborhoods. Under his leadership, the 49th Ward was selected as one of the first areas of the city to host a community policing pilot project, which resulted in a 54% reduction in serious crime over a 20-year period. Additionally, from January 1, 2013 to February 26, 2013, the 24th Police District, which includes Rogers Park and the adjacent Chicago neighborhood of , was the only of Chicago's 22 police districts in which no one was shot. Overall,  data shows the rate of all reported crimes in the 49th Ward has decreased by 48% between 2003 and 2018, 4% more than the overall decline in crime across the entire city of Chicago during the same period.  \n\n\n\nMoore gained national renown as a leader in the fight for living wages when he sponsored the landmark , which required large retail stores to pay their employees a wage sufficient to keep a family of four out of poverty. The ordinance was a precursor to Chicago's minimum wage ordinance, which guarantees all workers in Chicago a wage of at least $13 an hour indexed to inflation.\n\nMoore has also made it a priority to encourage entrepreneurs to open up new restaurants and businesses in his Ward. In 2007 Moore launched an initiative dubbed \"follow me on Fridays\" in which Moore encourages his constituents to join him at a local restaurant, pub, or festival twice a month after work on a Friday to promote local businesses and entrepreneurs in his Ward. The events have grown in popularity and have facilitated a recent surge in private business growth in Roger's Park.\n\n\n\nMoore became the first elected official in the United States to introduce a democratic budget allocation procedure known as . Each year since 2009, Moore has turned over $1 million of his discretionary capital budget to a process of democratic deliberation and decision-making in which his constituents decide through direct vote how to allocate his budget. Moore's participatory budgeting model has since been adopted by eight of his Chicago City Council colleagues, as well as in 16 other U.S. cities, including , , ,  and Vallejo, California. Over the past 9 years the 49th Ward constituents have voted to allocate Moore's discretionary capital budget to a wide array of projects ranging from resurfacing alleys and streets to beautifying the neighborhood through the creation of murals and planting of trees throughout the neighborhood. \n\n\n\nIn 2016, Moore worked with a private developer and the CHA to construct 65 units of affordable housing and 46 market rate units above a new Target on North Sheridan Road. In 2017, Moore helped a developer secure City of Chicago Low Income Housing Tax Credits to build 54 affordable housing units on top of 3,300 square feet of retail storefront space at Clark and Estes. In 2018, Moore convinced the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) to purchase Levy House at 1221 W. Sherwin, thus preserving 56 units affordable senior housing.\n\n\n\nMoore has actively opposed an elected school board in City Council, maneuvering to block a ballot measure.\n\nDespite 49th ward residents voting overwhelmingly to freeze charter school expansion, Moore has ignored his constituents and continued to push for more charters  as he collects campaign donations from Charter operators.\n\nRogers Park's schools have suffered under Moore, to the point of Gale Elementary's major issue with lead contamination  Since 1993, only $81.5 million for improvements to Roger's Park schools have been allocated by CPS, including modernization efforts at Sullivan High School, and a $5 million investment for a new roof at Kilmer School. \n\n\n\n\nThroughout his time as Alderman, Moore has overseen the creation of a number of annual events held in Rogers Park. One the oldest of these annual events is the Rogers Park Back to School Picnic which is held on the last Sunday of every August. The picnic has grown considerably since its founding in 1991 to include activities directed at a wide audience such as face painting, live music, bingo, and bouncy castles in addition to free food and school supplies.\n\nAlso founded by Moore, is the 49th Ward Annual Spring Clean-up and Taste of Roger's Park. Normally held on the Saturday before Earth Day, the annual clean-up brings together volunteers from across the neighborhood who either choose clean-up and/or beautification projects they wish to undertake or are directed by Alderman's office to areas of the Ward that need cleaning. At the end of the day participants are then given free food from restaurants around the ward to help promote local business growth.\n\nAdditionally Moore has also overseen the creation and implementation of several other annual (sometimes biannual) events listed in the table below.\n\n\n\nDuring Moore's tenure, Rogers Park and Alderman Moore himself have garnered national recognition and attention. In 2008, ,  correspondent for '''', blogging on ''The Nation'' website, named Moore \"Most Valuable Local Official.\" Also, In its July 2016 cover story, Time included Participatory Budgeting (pioneered by Moore) as one of the \"240 reasons to celebrate America right now.\" Additionally, a national real estate website named Rogers Park as the top neighborhood in Chicago and one of the top neighborhoods in the nation for \"living well.\" The website, Trulia, conducted a survey of 877 neighborhoods across the U.S., and named Rogers Park the 11th best neighborhood to live in the nation for staying active and healthy, ahead of all other Chicago neighborhoods.\n\nIn addition to serving as Alderman of the 49th Ward, Moore is a former chair of the Board of Directors of the Democratic Municipal Organization, a national association of elected municipal officials, with offices in his home in Rogers Park. Moore's wife, Barbara, is the Executive Director.\n\n\n\nMoore was the chief sponsor of an ordinance banning the sale of '''' in Chicago. After much publicity, the ordinance passed overwhelmingly but was repealed overwhelmingly. Moore was honored in February, 2007 by the Humane Society of the United States for his leadership on the issue of cruelty to animals. Moore's support of this issue was the subject of many widespread and derisive comments.

One woman profiled by the CPD had alleged to the Police Board that she had been sexually assaulted by a CPD officer years previously.

He has also spoken out about the influx of these cameras in minority and poverty stricken neighborhoods and House Bill 3927, introduced by Buckner, amends the Illinois Vehicle Code and makes these automated traffic law enforcement systems illegal.\n\nBuckner introduced House Bill 3584 in January 2019. It provides that victim impact statements received by Parole Boards shall be confidential and shall not be discoverable in litigation. It also amended the Open Parole Hearings Act to prevent the release of any material to the inmate, the inmate's attorney, any third party, or any other person that contains any information from the victim who has provided a victim impact statement, including the name and or address of the victim.

However, her regard for Johnson's electoral prospects appeared to change once Johnson's standing in the polls ascended.

This included bringing up 2009 remarks in which Vallas had expressed opposition to  and declared himself \"more of a Republican than a Democrat.\" In response to this line of criticism, Vallas proclaimed himself a \"lifelong Democrat\", citing his candidacy in the primary of the  and his unsuccessful campaign as the Democratic Party's nominee for lieutenant governor in the . Johnson also attacked Vallas as having hurt Chicago Public Schools' finances during his tenure as . Vallas accused Johnson of lacking \"substance\", accusing him of lacking a significant political record. Vallas campaigned on lowering crime while characterizing Brandon Johnson as wanting to \"defund the police\".\n\nJohnson and Vallas both agreed on continuing expanding the INVEST South/West Initiative launched by Mayor Lightfoot, which directs investment into historically disadvantaged South and West Side neighborhoods. Vallas and Johnson also agreed that the city should not utilize public money in order to persuade the  football team, which is pursuing a new stadium in the suburb of , to remain in the city of Chicago.\n\nPrior to advancing to the runoff, both Johnson and Vallas had come out in opposition to the notion of the city spending $2 billion or more to renovate and build a dome over the Bears' current municipally-owned home stadium, . While Vallas expressed his belief that it is a foregone matter that the Bears will not reconsider a move to Arlington Heights, in the runoff Johnson reiterated his previously declared stance that the city should still pursue the opportunity to negotiate with the football team, and pledged that as mayor he would \"sit down and work with the [Chicago Bears] ownership\", in order to see what arrangement the city and the team, \"can figure out\".\n\nOn April 4, Johnson defeated Vallas to win the runoff election.

He became mayor at noon on May 15, 2023.\n\nJohnson performed exceptionally strong in wards with majority black populations, winning as much as 80% in some such wards on the  and West Side of the city. He also performed strongly in some predominantly white lakeshore areas and in some Hispanic-majority areas northwest of the city's downtown.\n\nJohnson had been significantly out-fundraised in the election by Vallas, and outspent by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1. Some journalists have attributed  organizing in support of Johnson's candidacy as having been the difference-maker in his victory.\n\n\n\nMany of those who led Johnson's transition team, including its chair, had ties to trade unions.\n\nOn April 6, 2023, Mayor Johnson met with Mayor Lightfoot at her  office in order to discuss the mayoral transition. The following day, Mayor-elect Johnson met in person with Illinois Governor . He met in person with Illinois Attorney General  on April 14, 2023.\n\nOn April 11, 2023, Chicago was announced to have won the right to host the . Johnson had supported the city's bid. After they had defeated Lightfoot in the first round, both Johnson and Vallas each vowed to provide their support for the convention bid that Lightfoot had been championing as mayor. It was reported that when President  made a congratulatory phone call to Johnson after he was projected the election's victory, Johnson took the opportunity to pitch him on Chicago's bid to host the convention. After the mayoral election, in the final day before the  was to select a host city for the convention, Johnson and Governor Pritkzer had worked with each other to advance the case for Chicago to host.\n\nApproximately a week after his election, Johnson joined a picket line alongside striking faculty members at .\n\nIn April 2023, after several large groups of teens and young adults engaged in shootings and vandalism across multiple locations in the city, Mayor-Elect Johnson issued a statement, writing \"...in no way do I condone the destructive activity we saw in the Loop and lakefront this weekend.

However, higher-ups within the school district as well as the school board took issue, expressing concern over the prospect of taking on additional  obligation considering its existing debts.\n\nAmid a standstill, the teachers union publicly lambasted , blaming him and pejoratively labeling him a \"Lightfoot holdover\". Johnson came into conflict with Martinez, and privately requested his resignation (something he would attempt to publicly deny having done). On September 24, the ''Chicago Tribune'' published an  by Martinez in which he outlined his reasons for refusing Johnson's request for him to resign. With all of this occurring before a period of change for the board (with the  set to reshape its composition from an entirely-appointed board to a hybrid board), the incumbent board members all declined to dismiss Martinez. Ultimately, this conflict led to the entirety of the board (including board president Jianan Shi) to tender their own resignations in early October. 41 out of the 50 members of the Chicago City Council (including some of Johnson's key council allies) signed an  criticizing Johnson's move to quickly reshape the board only weeks before the school board election.

The shooter in question was a Muslim man who was alleged to have screamed \"Allahu Akbar\" in the video as he shot the victim, leading many to question why Mayor Johnson refused to acknowledge that the crime was caused by the shooter being aggravated at the victim's Jewish identity.

After retiring as a licensed practical nurse, she studied criminal justice and became a private investigator.\n\n\nIn 1994, Childs ran for an at-large seat on the Greenwood School District 50 board of trustees.

She was succeeded by Democrat Teresa Griffin.\n\n\nIn July 2013, the South Carolina ethics commission leveled a fine against Childs for what it found to be inappropriate spending of \"in district\" funds. The commission found that she used $100 to make personal donations to nonprofits outside Greenwood County. One of the contributions was $50 paid to put an advertisement in the program for a local beauty pageant.\n\n\n\nIn June 2007, then-Senator and presidential hopeful Barack Obama visited the small town of Greenwood, South Carolina (population 29,000) as part of his campaign efforts.

Childs, noticing the look on the candidate's face, yelled out to those assembled, \"Fired up!\" The room responded, \"Fired up!\" Obama, surprised by the enthusiasm, turned around to see Childs as she continued, \"Ready to go!\", to which the room again responded, \"Ready to go!\"  Soon after the campaign stop in Greenwood, the same chant was repeated at a larger Obama rally in .see the Aiken video here:  Before long, volunteers were carrying signs and wearing shirts printed with the slogan.

A member of the , he previously served in the  from 1991 through 2010.\n\nCronin was born in . He received a bachelor's degree from  and later graduated from the . Cronin spent his early legal career as counsel for the  from 1985 to 1987, then as a prosecutor in DuPage County from 1987 to 1989. Since 1991, he has worked in private practice. He comes from a family that has been politically prominent in DuPage. His father, a sports physician who ran his practice and owned a medical office building in Elmhurst, helped with Dan's campaigns. Dan's brother, an attorney, managed campaigns for Republican candidates at the state and county levels , then ran unsuccessfully for DuPage  during the . His sister, an accountant, previously served as city treasurer of Elmhurst and later as a member of the ; she was elected to the DuPage County Board .\n\nCronin was elected to the House of Representatives , after defeating Republican incumbent  on an anti-tax and anti- platform. He supported cutbacks to taxes and government spending, and earned a reputation as a conservative Republican. He then ran for the  during the . Recent  pitted Cronin against , an incumbent  senator, in what was considered one of the \"liveliest and most bitter contests\" of the election season. Cronin won the election. He became chairman of the Senate's education committee, where he sponsored or debated several bills concerning reforms of . He also sponsored legislation that restricted  funding for abortions, but the bill was vetoed by Governor .\n\nAfter becoming chairman of the DuPage County Board , Cronin launched initiatives to consolidate units of local government in the county. His reforms included merging the county's election commission into the county clerk's office in 2019, with the approval of voters during a non-binding countywide referendum. Cronin was re-elected to a second term . His accomplishments included reducing the county's sales tax by 0.25 percentage points. While running for his third term , he faced a strong challenge from Democratic candidate Lynn LaPlante, and narrowly won re-election. Following the 2018 elections, DuPage was no longer a Republican stronghold, and Cronin lamented increased political infighting on the board. , Democrats won a majority of the seats on the board for the first time since the 1930s. He submitted budgets for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 – his last as chairman – which kept property tax rates unchanged and took advantage of surpluses from rising sales tax revenues. Cronin decided not to run for re-election at the end of his term in 2022; he was succeeded by Democratic state representative .\n\n\n\nCronin was born on November 7, 1959, in . His parents, Richard Cronin and Claire Cronin (), had nine children: five sons and four daughters. The family lived across the street from . Cronin graduated from Immaculate Conception Grade School and . Cronin earned a  degree from  and a  degree from the . From 1985 to 1987, he served as legal counsel to , minority leader of the , where Cronin helped oversee the movement of legislation presented on the House floor.\n\nFrom 1987 through 1989, Cronin worked as a prosecutor in , serving under , the county . He worked alongside , who would eventually become state's attorney in 1996 and  judge in 2010. In 1991, he began to practice law at Cronin & Ruggiero, where he specialized in criminal law, family law, and real estate. He was also associated with Kemp & Capanna Ltd. In 1993, he transferred to Power & Cronin, based in . He eventually became a senior partner at that law firm.\n\n\nDan is married to Juliann Ashley Cronin, owner of A&H Lithoprint, a  company in . Juliann is also a part-time yoga instructor. The couple became engaged in October 1991 and married in May 1992. They have three daughters and one son, and they are members of Immaculate Conception  in Elmhurst.\n\nCronin is part of a large, , ,  political family. Most of the family lives in DuPage, several in Elmhurst. Around 50 family members and friends attended his inauguration to the House of Representatives in 1991. After Dan was elected to the  in 1992, the Cronin family was called the \" of DuPage\" or \"Kennedys of Elmhurst\", not necessarily a compliment in the Republican-dominated county. The family was seen as politically ambitious, potentially prompting animosity and wariness from incumbents and insiders.\n\n\nDan's father, Richard Cronin, was born in . Richard played football while attending Fenwick High School and the , where he graduated in 1946. He earned a  degree in 1950 at the , part of , and completed his  at the . He and Claire Cusack married in 1952. Richard enlisted in the  in 1954 and served as an  resident for two years at  in . He then opened a medical practice in Chicago's west suburbs, and in 1960 the family moved from  to Elmhurst. Within the next few years, he organized a group of around ten doctors who purchased land to construct a medical office building at Palmer Drive and Kenilworth Avenue in Elmhurst. He specialized in sports medicine, and was crucial to the recovery of , who suffered an injury in 1964 while playing football at Notre Dame and later went on to play for the . In 1986, Richard acquired full ownership of his office building after buying out the other partners. Richard was also a clinical medical professor at Loyola, and served as the vice chair and program director of the school's department of orthopedics. He retired from practicing medicine in the 1990s, but continued to manage the office building. He subsequently helped Dan with his senate and county board campaigns. Richard died in 2016, aged 89.\n\n\nTom Cronin, Dan's younger brother by four years, was interested in politics as early as when he attended York Community High School. He and Dan worked at the Elmhurst office of Daniels, their state representative. Tom pursued undergraduate studies in political philosophy at , and continued to work for Daniels during summer breaks. He then received a Juris Doctor and a  at the . From 1990 to 1992, he  for , chief judge of the  and former state's attorney of DuPage. Tom then worked as an attorney at  starting in the fall of 1992. He took a leave of absence to work on campaigning during the , managing Ryan's successful campaign for attorney general and Gayle Franzen's campaign for DuPage County board chairman. He earned $3,400 per month while serving as campaign manager for Franzen, who had turned to Tom and Dan for help in asserting Franzen's independence from party leadership. Tom's and Dan's mother, Claire Cronin, and two sisters also volunteered for Franzen's campaign.\n\nTom had political ambitions of his own. In 1994, he expressed interest in running for the  if Representative , whose district included northeastern DuPage, were to retire. (Hyde did not retire until 2007, and Tom did not run to replace him.) Tom ran for DuPage state's attorney in 1996 against Birkett, who by then had worked in the state's attorney's office for 14 years and was endorsed by DuPage Republican leaders. Tom positioned himself as the outsider candidate, despite having managed the campaigns of Ryan and Franzen. At a forum between the two candidates, Dan asked a question attacking Birkett for accepting campaign contributions from criminal defense attorneys. During the campaign, Dan also protested language in sample letters circulated among Republican precinct workers that endorsed Birkett and criticized Tom. Additionally, Tom faced criticisms for receiving traffic tickets and failing to appear in court to answer them, causing his drivers license to be suspended. Tom lost to Birkett.\n\nDan's and Tom's sister, Cindy Cronin Cahill, was the first in the family to enter politics. A part-time accountant with her own company, Cahill ran for city treasurer of Elmhurst in 1989. The Cronin family helped with canvassing, including Juliann, who had not yet married Dan. Cahill was the youngest candidate in the race, and defeated her two male opponents by a wide margin. After four years, she stepped down as treasurer in 1993 to care for her children. Cahill later served as a member of the  from 2012 through 2019. She was elected to the county board during the .\n\n\nCronin considered running for the General Assembly in 1986 and 1988. Daniels, by then the House minority leader, advised him to wait both times. Cronin declined to wait at the , when he ran for the 40th district of the House of Representatives. During the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent , who had been in the legislature for 24 years and was the longest-serving Republican in the House. Financing for the campaign came primarily from Dan's father, Richard Cronin. The campaign was managed by Tom Cronin, Dan's brother, and also Tom Manion, a political operative from Elmhurst who previously directed field operations for the campaigns of Chicago Mayor  and US Representative . Pam McDonough, chief of staff for Daniels, regarded Cronin as a \"good campaigner\".\n\nCronin touted an anti-tax platform, which appealed to voters, especially the conservative wing of the Republican Party. He portrayed Hoffman as being aligned with special interests. Cronin also criticized his opponent for supporting a temporary increase to state income taxes to fund education, suggesting that Hoffman was more interested in his dream job of becoming . Cronin, an  candidate, contrasted himself from Hoffman's support for abortion rights. He positioned his campaign as a change from the incumbents, and he pledged to make government more responsive and accessible to the public.\n\nA few weeks before the primary in March, Cronin's campaign claimed that roughly 150  were removed from properties along major roadways in Elmhurst. Supporters speculated that Hoffman's backers had removed the signs ahead of the arrival of Governor , who was visiting Elmhurst to endorse Hoffman. Cronin's anti-establishment positions, though they helped him win the primary, did not endear him to the party's leadership. He referred to Daniels, a Hoffman supporter, as \"ineffective\", and the relationship between Cronin and Daniels became strained. By the general election, Cronin would eventually ease the criticism and work with Daniels again. Tom and Dan Cronin worked afterwards to further improve their relationship with Daniels.\n\nIn the general election, Cronin faced  nominee Truman Kirkpatrick, a retired chemist from . Cronin estimated that his campaign debt could reach $60,000–70,000, of which $25,000 was a personal loan, compared to Kirkpatrick's much more modest campaign. He urged an audit of the , and pledged to give the DuPage County auditor the authority to audit school districts and agencies of county government. Cronin supported amending the  to provide for more referendums and to promote tax accountability. Kirkpatrick, an abortion rights advocate, believed 70% of voters in the district to be against Cronin's anti-abortion stance. Further, while Cronin supported requiring a supermajority in the  to increase taxes, Kirkpatrick countered that the scheme would make it easier for a simple majority of the legislature to spend without being able to back it up with revenue.\n\nCronin won the election and began his term in the House in January 1991. He credited his victory against Hoffman for attracting statewide attention to rising property taxes. He supported cutbacks to state programs and personnel, and sponsored legislation that capped property taxes in the suburban counties. However, he opposed property tax-capping legislation sponsored by Daniels and Senate Minority Leader , claiming the bill extended or made permanent a surcharge on the state's income tax.\n\nAs of October 1992, Cronin was the youngest member of the General Assembly. He earned a reputation as a conservative Republican. However, he supported paid family leave, opposed by Republican leadership and business constituents.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1991, Republicans took control of the  of the state's legislative districts, and drew maps that gave partisan advantage to Republican candidates, especially in the . Under the new maps, suburban voters controlled more legislative districts than  or  voters for the first time, reflecting population shifts. For the , Cronin decided to run in the new 39th senate district, solidly Republican territory with two-thirds of the district in DuPage. Two suburban senate districts in Chicago were eliminated. Senator , a Democrat of , was forced into the 39th district, losing much of his base to another district.\n\nThe race between Cronin and Leverenz was considered one of the \"liveliest and most bitter contests\" of the election season. Democratic colleagues regarded Leverenz as a strong campaigner to help overcome his steep odds. He touted his lengthy career as a state legislator for more than 16 years, and his pro-suburban record. Cronin, already being mentioned by observers as a possible candidate for statewide office in the 1994 elections, cast the race as a choice between a suburban conservative and a \"\" with ties to Chicago. Manion, who managed Cronin's previous campaign for the House, likewise managed this campaign for the Senate. Cronin won, and he joined the Senate in 1993.\n\nIn the , Cronin was challenged in the Republican primary by attorney Nancy Miller, but he won re-election. He was seen as a potential candidate for attorney general in the  as Ryan, the incumbent, considered running for the US Senate. (Ryan ultimately did not run for US Senate in 1998.) \n in .]]\nThe state's legislative districts were again redistricted in 2001. For the , Cronin ran for the newly-established 21st district. Tom Walsh, the Republican incumbent senator for the then-existing 22nd district, was forced to run in the same district against Cronin. In February, Cronin was criticized for committing $30,000 in '''' grant funding to a proposed  in , which was outside his present 39th district but inside the new 21st district he was running for. The gazebo had been backed by Illinois Treasurer  and North Riverside Mayor Richard Scheck. Cronin defended his actions by pointing to his record of supporting other projects outside his district. He won the election.\n\nDuring the , Cronin endorsed Jeff Redick, a colleague at Cronin's law firm, during a successful run for a seat on the DuPage County Board. In April 2007, Cronin became the chairman of the DuPage County Republican Party, succeeding Senator . His priorities as party chair included filling all vacant  positions and conducting performance evaluations of incumbent committeemen. Cronin assumed this role at a time when Republican margins of victory in county races were getting slimmer. By then, Democrats had taken control over state government.\n\n\nIn 1994, Cronin supported a bill backed by Governor  that would have , though the measure faced strong opposition from Philip. He also sponsored a bill attempting to reverse the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in the  and keep children with their adoptive parents. The following year, he sponsored a bill that authorized winners of the  to receive their winnings as lump-sum payments.\n\nCronin served as chair of the Senate's education committee and was regarded as a leading voice for Senate Republicans on education issues. In 1995, he sponsored a bill that gave the  more control over the management of  (CPS). The following year, he backed a measure that would have required pay raises for teachers to be based on merit rather than seniority. In 1997, Cronin worked with several legislators to overhaul funding for public schools in Illinois, and supported Edgar's proposal to switch the burden from property taxes to income taxes. In 1998, he supported a proposal to provide direct financial relief to , amidst a broader push towards tax credits for private school tuition. In 1999, Cronin sponsored a bill that would have removed the power of  to fire principals without the approval of central administration, but postponed further action on the bill after it became controversial. In 2002, he opposed an agreement between CPS and the  that restored some of the bargaining rights that had been restricted under the 1995 law. In 2004, he opposed a deal in which Governor  earmarked $20 million towards the , a project backed by Senate President , in exchange for giving the governor more power over the . In 2007, Cronin proposed a bill that would have reviewed the role and authority of Local School Councils, but the legislation did not move forward.\n\nIn 2000, Cronin sponsored legislation that would have restricted  funding for abortions. The bill was vetoed by Governor , a Republican who had long opposed abortion rights, prompting condemnation by Cronin and other social conservatives. In 2002, he sponsored a bill requiring the  to consult local communities and environmental groups on projects affecting highways.\n\nCronin sponsored a constitutional amendment to allow voters to recall elected officials, but the proposal was blocked by Senate Democrats. In 2008, he voted in favor of a pension reform bill that required the  (CTA) to increase its pension contributions. In 2010, he co-sponsored legislation with Representative  that would reform DuPage County's water commission, an independent entity, by bringing it under the county's direct control. The proposal came after it was revealed that the commission had misspent around $69 million in reserve funds, with the financial administrator spending down some of those reserve funds without informing the water commission. A forensic audit revealed that missteps by the commission, the financial administrator, and the general manager caused several accounting errors that nearly depleted the reserves. The city council of  joined the DuPage Mayors and Managers Conference in opposing the legislation, citing fears that the county would be taking control over municipal amenities.\n\nCronin stepped down from the Senate on November 30, 2010, after being elected to the county board. He was replaced by .\n\n\n|left]]\n\n\nCronin ran for chairman of the DuPage County Board during the . He announced his candidacy at a  hotel in ; over 300 supporters attended the event. In the Republican primary, he faced Senator ,  Mayor Gary Grasso, and county board member Debra Olson. All four candidates touted their experience in government. Grasso differentiated himself from his opponents as the only candidate to have experience as an executive of a government. Pankau stated that she would be a full-time board chairman, unlike her opponents who have other jobs or business interests. Cronin won the primary, and faced Democratic candidate Carole Cheney, an attorney from . By then, countywide elections would depend more on support from independent voters. Cheney ran a positive campaign, though she labeled Cronin as a \"career politician\".\n\nIn September 2010, Cronin opposed the county board's decision to issue a large amount of bonds. At the time, Cronin's relationship with the county board was perceived to have been \"icy\" for a long time. Later that month, the board voted to take away several powers from the chairman, which Cronin saw as a reaction to the possibility of him winning the election. The board, seeking more  between the county executive and legislature, gave itself more oversight over the hiring of staff members, the ability to conduct decennial redistricting via a board committee, and the authority to determine its own committee assignments and appoint committee chairs.\n\nCronin subsequently won the general election after receiving nearly 63 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\nShortly after taking office, Cronin appointed Robert Berlin, a veteran prosecutor and chief of criminal prosecutions in the county, to succeed Birkett as DuPage state's attorney. The appointment was regarded as Cronin's \"first major decision\" as board chairman, due to the perceived high profile and powerful position of the state's attorney.\n\nIn January 2011, the DuPage County Board approved a $125,000 contract with a distinguished law firm based in  to assist with redistricting the county's electoral boundaries. Cronin, who does not vote unless there is a tie, raised concerns regarding the contract's vague terms, including its open-ended nature and lack of clear responsibilities. He emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in government contracts and successfully removed a confidentiality provision. However, the decision also faced scrutiny from Democrat board members, due to the firm's contributions of nearly $16,000 to the campaign funds of nine board members. Democrat members labeled it as \"pay to play\" politics, despite not offering an alternative firm for consideration. Other board members characterized the donations as minor and insisted that it did not influence their vote, emphasizing the firm's qualifications and expertise in redistricting. Observers of the issue noted that business contributions are a common, legal practice. The law firm stated they contribute to candidates they believe do the best for government and constituents, notably citing a $10,000 donation made to Democratic Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2003, indicating its political contributions spanned across county lines. The law firm was also involved in redrawing legislative maps for both DuPage and the state of Illinois in the last redistricting a decade prior. \n\nIn April 2011, Cronin announced the formation of a committee aimed at aligning county employee benefits with those in the private sector, primarily to address rising pension costs. A key focus was on \"pension spiking,\" where additional payouts for sick leave and vacation days are added to an employee's final salary for pension calculations. Cronin highlighted that the current system diverts funds from essential services like flood control and affordable housing. The committee also reviewed the controversial Elected County Officials (ECO) pension plan, which has allowed some part-time elected officials to receive substantial pensions, often exceeding $100,000 annually. This system was criticized for its lenient rules regarding salary calculations, allowing significant pay increases shortly before retirement to inflate pension benefits. Cronin described these pension arrangements as \"outrageous\" and unfair to taxpayers, especially those in the private sector facing economic uncertainty. \n\nBy August, DuPage County saw a significant increase in retirements, with over 100 county employees retired in 2011, compared to 25 the previous year. Cronin attributed this surge to recent changes in employment benefits, specifically the scaling back of time-off policies aimed at saving the county up to $28 million over two weeks. Effective that December, the changes eliminated large cash payouts for unused sick days and reduced vacation days for long-term employees. Board members emphasized that these reforms were necessary for long-term financial stability, as previous benefits were unsustainable. Finance officials estimated the policy changes could save the county between $8 million and $12 million over 20 years. Cronin believes that maintaining the old policy could have cost the county an additional $20 million in that timeframe. He also expressed support for ongoing pension reform discussions at the state level, acknowledging the financial pressures from pension benefits on government budgets.\n\nIn July 2011, Cronin stepped down as chairman of the DuPage County Republican Party, prompting the executive committee to unanimously select State Representative Randy Ramey as his successor. Cronin, who had led the county Republicans since taking over from State Senator Kirk Dillard nearly four years prior, cited his heavy workload as DuPage County Board chairman. A week prior, Governor Pat Quinn had tapped Cronin to head the Elgin-O’Hare West Bypass committee. \n\nIn June 2012, Elmhurst officials received a legal opinion stating they could prohibit local leaders from serving on more than one elected board if residents supported the measure in a referendum. This discussion followed Mayor Pete DiCianni’s announcement that he would resign as mayor if elected to the DuPage County Board in November, citing the distraction as a burden on the city. The issue of dual office-holding had been contentious, with DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin advising against it. While a state proposal allowing mayors to also serve on county boards did not advance, DuPage County Board Chairman Dan Cronin introduced a ballot question on the matter for the November 2012 elections. Cronin expressed concerns that dual office-holding prevented officials from adequately serving taxpayers.\n\nAccording to an investigation published by the  (BGA) in 2013, Cronin's administration signed contracts with four firms connected to state legislative leaders, including House Speaker , Senate President , Senate President ''pro tempore'' , and House Minority Leader . The BGA speculated that these contracts were intended to bolster a potential run for higher office in the future, along with an aggressive legislative agenda that supported Cronin's efforts to consolidate governmental agencies in DuPage.\n\nIn April 2014, Cronin claimed that labor and pension costs of the CTA were a \"drag\" on the entire . He also lamented that CTA was getting a greater share of discretionary funds compared to the region's other transit agencies, including , echoing concerns that he had previously raised in 2012.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Cronin launched efforts to consolidate units of government in DuPage. His efforts were labelled the \"ACT Initiative\", where \"ACT\" stands for \"Accountability, Consolidation, Transparency\". Cronin worked with State Senator  and other legislators to propose bills in the General Assembly that would have granted DuPage more authority over agencies whose officers are appointed by the county board. In 2011, after Cronin faced difficulties inspecting the finances of various agencies under his purview, Cullerton sponsored a bill requiring such agencies to provide documents and certain information to the county board. In 2014, Cronin helped form Transform Illinois, a statewide collaboration of elected officials, private organizations, and civic activists. Transform Illinois advocated for legislation favoring government efficiency, though the organization became inactive in 2020 amid the .\n\nIn August 2013, the General Assembly passed a bill that gave the county board the authority to dissolve or consolidate 13 units of government: four sanitary districts, three fire districts, two mosquito abatement districts, the airport authority, county fair authority, housing authority, and a district responsible for street lights. The Timberlake Estates Sanitary District, an inactive district, was dissolved in 2013 with the support of a majority of residents in the district. By 2014, the county government achieved roughly $80 million in savings from reducing or eliminating government agencies. Meanwhile, around 60 board members of agencies under Cronin's purview did not support these consolidation efforts, and either resigned or were not reappointed to their roles. In 2015, Cronin considered the dissolution of the Salt Creek Sanitary District. Eventually, the county eliminated its Fair & Exposition Authority, the Century Hill Street Lighting District, the Fairview Fire Protection District, the Highland Hills Sanitary District, and the North Westmont Fire Protection District.\n\nIn 2016, county and state officials estimated that DuPage had saved $116 million through shared services, $20 million through reforming employee benefits, and $6.9 million through closing the county's youth home and consolidating its youth detention services with .\n\nBy 2018, reforms of the county's election commission had achieved roughly $3 million in savings. Cronin proposed merging the election commission into the county clerk's office, expected to save as much as an additional $300,000 annually. In 2017, Senators Harmon and  proposed a bill that would have consolidated the two agencies and established a five-member oversight board within the clerk's office. The board would have included two Democrats and two Republicans appointed by Cronin as county board chairman, with the county clerk serving as the board's fifth member and chairman. Some opponents were against giving Cronin the authority to appoint commissioners to the oversight board, and other opponents expressed concerns about the anticipated salaries of the commissioners in the expanded board. Cronin countered that the full county board would review and approve appointments to the election board, a power that the county board had not previously held. He also expected that salaries of the new election board to fall from the annual pay for commissioners at the time: $27,500. The proposal passed the Senate, but stalled in the House rules committee.\n\nA separate bill, introduced in the House in February 2018, proposed to consolidate the agencies without creating a separate board. A non-binding countywide referendum was held on the matter in March of that year, with 56% of voters supporting consolidation. During , the election commission faced technical issues that caused significant delays in reporting the results, accelerating calls for the merger to take place. In May 2018, the General Assembly passed legislation that would allow the county board to finalize the merger without creating a separate board. In January 2019, the county board formally dissolved the election commission, despite a request from County Clerk Jean Kaczmarek to delay the merger until May.\n\nCronin has also suggested consolidating the  office, which is not a constitutional office in Illinois, with another county office or department. As of 2020, Cronin's efforts to consolidate agencies in DuPage, including the election commission, were expected to save $145 million over a 20-year period.\n\n\nCronin ran for re-election . He was challenged by Democratic candidate Robert Peickert, a former small business owner and chairman of the DuPage County Democratic Party. During the campaign, after initial efforts to impose stormwater fees garnered strongly negative public feedback, Cronin proposed setting fees based on how much water a given property displaces into public waterways, while Peickert proposed increasing sales tax revenues to pay for flood mitigation. Peickert also called for more engineering plans and capabilities to support stormwater projects, and criticized Cronin and other officials for not doing enough, but Cronin pointed to a lack of funding as a major constraint. Peickert touted his availability to work full-time as board chairman, in contrast to Cronin, an attorney in addition to his county office. Cronin argued that the connections he formed while a state legislator help him secure funding for the county's stormwater projects. Ultimately, Cronin won with 64 percent of the vote.\n\nIn April 2016, the county's water commission released a tentative budget that reduced operating expenses for the fifth consecutive year, and lowered water rates for the second consecutive year. By June of that year, county officials were able to abolish the 0.25 percent sales tax originally approved in 1985 to fund the water commission, allowing the sales tax on general merchandise in DuPage to fall from 7.25 to 7 percent. Cronin celebrated during a county board meeting by cutting one-fourth of a layer cake designed in the image of a penny.\n\nIn August 2016, Cronin supported the county board's decision to spend $290,000 to hire federal and state lobbyists. During the local elections in April 2017, Cronin endorsed  for mayor of Aurora. In September, Cronin appointed Burr Ridge resident Greg Hart to the county board to replace , who had been appointed to the Senate. Cronin presented a balanced budget for fiscal year 2018, despite the challenges faced from a $2.7 million reduction in revenue. This revenue loss was caused by the state keeping 10% of the income tax revenue intended for municipalities and counties as well as reducing DuPage's share of the RTA sales tax and personal property replacement revenues. Cronin's budget allocated funds toward public safety, the DuPage Care Center, a new communications center for DuPage County Public Safety Communications, among other projects. In November of that year, Cronin joined local mayors and county officials in opposing the Small Cell Wireless Bill (SB1451), proposed state legislation that would regulate  wireless installations statewide, but not on a local level. The local officials argued that while 5G technology was needed, statewide regulation would give private companies control over installations on taxpayer-owned facilities, also imposing a low fee for local government to recover costs incurred by the use of those facilities. Local officials urged the state legislature to negotiate the bill to ensure fairness to local communities. The bill was signed into law in April 2018, exempting Chicago from the legislation.\n\nIn September 2018, Cronin joined a letter written by Curran, regarding an ongoing public health investigation of a sterilization plant in  operated by Sterigenics International. Amidst an attempt by the  (under the direction of Governor ) to withhold relevant pollution reports from the office of the , Curran and Cronin urged cooperation between Rauner and Attorney General  to review the emissions permit previously issued to Sterigenics. Later that month, Cronin met with , assistant administrator of the federal  for air and radiation, to urge increased monitoring of pollutants at the facility.\n\n\n\nCronin ran for reelection in November 2018, and he was challenged by Democratic candidate Lynn LaPlante, principal violist for the Chicago Jazz Philharmonic. Cronin's campaign focused on his record of not raising property taxes on residents. However, Peickert, as chairman of the DuPage County Democratic Party, countered that the board had merely passed a maintenance budget with no initiatives. Cronin won reelection with 51% of the vote, but faced a strong challenge from LaPlante, who earned 49% of the vote. Peickert considered the thin margin to be a good showing for LaPlante, a first-time candidate.\n\nAs of the 2018 election, DuPage was no longer a Republican stronghold, with Democrats winning all of  in the county. Democrats outperformed Republicans in other elections, winning several state legislative races, the county clerk's race, and one county judgeship. In the county board, which has 18 members, Democrats increased their seats from one to seven. The results were driven by unfavorable opinions of President  and Governor Rauner, both Republicans, and the diversifying demographics of DuPage County. Over the year following the election, Cronin lamented increased partisan fighting within the board. Democratic and Republican members fought over appointments and committee assignments, whether to have s at the beginning of board meetings, consolidation proposals, and accusations of bullying.\n\nIn June 2019, Cronin submitted a proposal to divide the responsibilities of the outgoing county administrator among three executives, which was approved by a 14–3 vote despite accusations that Cronin's plans had not been transparent. In September, Cronin presented his proposed budget for the following fiscal year, but was later criticized by Democrats for not holding workshop meetings or sharing public feedback with the board. He also resisted a request from Kaczmarek and several local chapters of the  to increase the budget for the clerk's office to $9 million. Kaczmarek had requested additional funding to address anticipated record turnout in the , but Cronin still considered it a \"dramatic increase\". The board approved the budget in November with an 11–6 vote. In October 2019, the board approved a 3% tax on  in DuPage. However, the county did not receive tax revenue for 18 months of sales, estimated to be $4 million, after discovering in fall 2021 that the  had not received the required paperwork from the county clerk's office, run by Kaczmarek. Cronin and Kaczmarek blamed each other for apparent errors in their respective processes.\n\nIn July 2020, Democrats on the board criticized Cronin for appointing Republican Sam Tornatore as the chair of the board's health and human services committee, passing over Democrat and committee vice-chair Julie Renehan. During the 2020 elections, Democrats won additional races for the county board, enough to give them a majority for the first time since the 1930s. Democrats in DuPage also prevailed in every federal election and several races at the state and county level.\n\nIn early 2021, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Cronin criticized the state  for providing inadequate vaccine doses to DuPage. For fiscal year 2022, Cronin drafted a budget that took advantage of rising sales tax revenues while keeping the property tax rate unchanged. With sales tax revenues exceeding expectations by $24 million, the budget included funding to replace aging vehicles, support infrastructure projects, and pay down debt issued for draining projects. In August 2022, Cronin drew controversy for appointing his former Democratic opponent LaPlante, who by then had been elected as a county board member, to the county's board of health, declining to reappoint an incumbent Democrat, Paula Deacon Garcia. Garcia's allies on the county board contended that Cronin's successor should make the appointment, despite the same allies arguing that vacancies needed to be filled. Ultimately, the board approved LaPlante's appointment. Several Democrats also unsuccessfully opposed Cronin's appointment of Noreen Ligino-Kubinski, former alderman of , where the airport is located, to the board of the  Authority. In September, Cronin appointed Amy Phillips, a sustainability consultant from Naperville, to fill a vacancy on the county board left by the resignation of Democratic member Amy Chavez. Her appointment received unanimous approval by the County Board. By the end of fiscal year 2022, Cronin left behind a $40 million surplus and a balanced budget for fiscal year 2023. The surplus was driven by sales tax revenues exceeding the county's initial expectations, especially taxes on internet sales, a relatively new source of revenue. The surplus was allocated towards new projects including nursing home renovations, transportation infrastructure, a stormwater project and installation of roof-mounted solar panels, to name a few. Cronin reduced property taxes for the average DuPage County homeowner while also providing pay raises for employees. In Cronin's time as Chairman, he managed to secure a balanced budget each year.\n\n\nIn September 2021, Cronin announced that he would not run for re-election at the end of his term in 2022. At the time, his campaign fund held over $400,000. Though he stated that he was not leaving because of the Democratic majority on the board, he continued to express frustration with the partisan disputes. Supporters have encouraged him to run for statewide or federal office in the future. Cronin was mentioned as a potential challenger to incumbent  in the , but he dismissed such speculation. He supported Irvin, a candidate in the Republican primary, as a member of Irvin's law enforcement advisory council.\n\nCronin endorsed Hart, who by then had moved to , to succeed him as board chairman during the 2022 elections. Hart won the Republican primary but was defeated by , a state representative and the Democratic nominee. Cronin shared his plans to serve on nonprofit boards and remain politically active, using his campaign fund to support like-minded candidates. Upon leaving office as board chairman, Cronin formed the DuPage Leadership  to promote Republicans and Democrats running for local office. He also announced plans to continue working at his law firm, take a European vacation, and mentor young policymakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Many migrants have been sleeping at . Ramirez and an anonymous aide attended the protest “to address misinformation being spread about my involvement with the plan and how we should move forward as a community.” However, the crowds surrounded her and her aide and assaulted them.\n\nIn early December 2023, it was announced that Governor  stopped the building of the tents. This was due to environmental concerns of heavy metals and toxins. Ramirez states mixed emotions as “There were big concerns about public safety and I believe that public safety is providing people with shelter and feeding people, but we also need to make sure that it works for everybody.” Ramirez stated disappointment with the lack of communication with other Chicago politicians.\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Ramirez stated she wants to address public safety with a holistic approach, and introduce resources to act as preventive measurements for community members, such as those that provide mental health and social services.

His house district included much of the eastern portion of his senate district; Illinois state senate districts are formed by combining two neighboring house districts.\n\nIn the House, Martwick was Chairperson of the Personnel & Pensions Committee. He is also assigned to the following committees: Elementary and Secondary Education: School Curric Policies; Revenue & Finance; and Transportation: Regulation, Roads.\n\nAs of July 2022, Senator Martwick was a member of the following Illinois Senate committees:\n\n* Appropriations - Personnel and Procurement Committee (SAPP-SAPP)\n* Appropriations Judiciary Committee (SAPP-SAJU)\n* Criminal Law Committee (SCCL)\n* Criminal Law - Juvenile Court Committee (SCJC)\n* Education Committee (SCCL-SCJC)\n* Environment and Conservation Committee (SNVR)\n* Judiciary Committee (SJUD)\n* Judiciary - Property Law Committee (SJUD-DJPL)\n* Judiciary - Torts Committee (SJUD-SJTO)\n* (Chairman of) Pensions Committee (SPEN)\n* Problem-Solving Courts Committee (SCCL-SCPS)\n* Redistricting - Chicago Northwest Committee (SRED-SRNW)\n* Revenue Committee (SREV)\n\n\nMatwick is a staunch proponent of an elected school board for . Martwick has proposed bills for an elected Chicago school board during the previous two General Assemblies.\n\nIn the 99th General Assembly, Martwick was the chief sponsor of HB557. HB 557 would subdivide the City of Chicago into 20 electoral districts by the Illinois General Assembly for seats on the . The bill passed the House 110-4 in March 2016, but stalled in the Illinois Senate. During the 100th General Assembly, Martwick proposed House Bill 1774 which would provide for the election of the Chicago Board of Education starting with the 2019 consolidated election. The board would have had a single member elected citywide and twenty members elected from districts drawn by the state legislature. The bill passed the  105-9. A similar bill passed the Illinois Senate, but the two bills failed to be reconciled before the end of the legislative session.\n\n\nAs a freshman legislator, Martwick introduced House Bill 5318 that became an important part of the .\n\nMartwick's provision created an \"automatic objection\" to the application for a conceal and carry permit made by persons who had been arrested 5 or more times in the previous 7 years (for any reason) and by persons who had been arrested 3 or more times in the previous 7 years for gang related activity. Any person whose application has been objected to must appear before a 7 panel license review committee which holds a hearing and decides whether to grant the license to the applicant. This automatic objection process helped make Illinois'  law into a \"hybrid\" shall issue/may issue law, providing for a tool to deny licenses to people who repeatedly run afoul of the law, while at the same time ensuring that law abiding citizens would not have their rights infringed upon. Martwick's provision was widely backed by both concealed carry advocates and gun control advocates, and it received more votes than any other provision in the concealed carry legislation. Shortly after it became law, a known gang leader was denied a concealed carry permit due to this provision.\n\n\nIn early 2019, Martwick introduced legislation that would make the position of Cook County Assessor an appointed position, rather than an elected one (as it currently is). On February 18, 2019,  (then a candidate in the , which she would later go on to win), held a press conference in which she criticized this. Martwick attended this press conference, and got into a heated impromptu debate with Lightfoot, which generated headlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n* at the Illinois General Assembly\n* constituency site\n*, campaign website\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He graduated from  and attended .\n\nSchilling worked at  between 1983 and 1987 and was a union steward for the local chapter of the . He then  worked as an insurance agent for  between 1987 and 1995, where he was ranked in the top 5% of all Prudential agents during his last year. He was also the treasurer for the  Union for four of those years.\n\nIn 1996, Schilling and his wife opened Saint Giuseppe's Heavenly Pizza in . Schilling ran the restaurant until he became a member of Congress, when he left his son in charge. According to public personal financial disclosures, Schilling's restaurant dropped in value in the early 2010s from a range of $100,000 to $250,000 down to between $50,000–$100,000. Schilling's son and campaign manager Terry Schilling said, \"The real estate market has really taken a hit in East Moline. It just goes to show that Bobby Schilling has a real stake in this economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchilling grew up as a Democrat, but became more conservative over the years and characterized himself as a \"Reagan Republican.\" He was also influenced by radio and television personality . Schilling was one of the 9–12 Candidates, a group led by Beck, and signed the 9–12 contract of principles and values. Schilling has said he was inspired to run for office because he was preparing to  his restaurant, but cancelled his plans when he saw then-Presidential candidate  telling  that the government needed to \"spread the wealth around.\" Schilling announced his candidacy in April 2009 and officially filed for the Republican nomination in October 2009. Schilling was unopposed in the primary election.\n\nSchilling vowed not to participate in the  program, to keep his private health insurance instead of the congressional plan, to donate any pay raises he received, to limit himself to no more than eight years in Congress, and not to vote for any bill he had not read. \"I'm not going to make a career out of this,\" he said.\n\nEarly in Schilling's campaign, political websites rated the 17th District race \"safe Democratic.\" However, by Election Day the race was rated \"leans Republican\" by , , , and ''''. The race was profiled on  as one of the country's top 100 House races. CNN reported, \"Schilling trails in the overall money race, but he's raised enough to get his message out and give the incumbent something to worry about.\" In September 2010, Schilling was named to the 's \"\" program.\n\nSchilling's Democratic opponent, incumbent , criticized Schilling for living 0.99 miles outside the 17th District, though the  only requires members of Congress to live within the state they wish to represent. Schilling's wife noted that the family's restaurant was located in the district, and that it employed people and paid taxes there. She asserted that  had caused the family's home to fall outside district lines.\n\nSchilling was endorsed by the  Tea Party group;  PAC; the .   (R-IL); and former  .\n\nNewspapers were evenly divided in endorsing Schilling over Hare, with the '''' and the ''Sauk Valley News'' among those supporting Schilling. In October 2010, Schilling was endorsed by the ''''.\n\nIn the general election, Schilling won by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 53 percent of the vote to Hare's 43 percent.

Schilling's campaign fundraising relied largely on individual donors, who accounted for about 80 percent of the $1 million raised by his campaign. Hare depended more heavily on , who contributed about two-thirds of his campaigns $1.3 million total. Following his election, Schilling relied more on political action committees to help retire his campaign debt, with the bulk of his December 2010 fundraising coming from PACs, including , the ,  and  Co. Schilling ended the campaign with a total of $1,095,167 raised and $1,078,911 spent.\n\nAfter the election, Schilling hired as his  Mike Roman, a political consultant known for posting a video showing  during the 2008 presidential election. Roman, along with policy director Scott Tranter, resigned from Schilling's office in April 2011.\n\n\n\nSchilling ran for re-election in  and faced Democrat and former  City Council Alderwoman  in the general election. He has been added to the National Republican Congressional Committee's Patriot Program, which is designed to defend incumbent Republicans. Bustos received a significant assist from the 2010 round of redistricting.  The 17th already had a modest Democratic lean, but the Democratic-controlled legislature redrew the district to make it even more Democratic.  Notably, ,  and the district's share of  were cut out, replaced by the more Democratic portions of  and .  's  named Schilling one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012.\n\nSchilling has raised $1.4 million and had $950,000 cash on hand as of June 30, 2011.\n\nWhile initially rated as a \"lean-Democrat\" race by major sites, in September 2012, '''', the , and the Rothenburg Political Report upgraded the race to \"toss-up\", with Cook saying Schilling had an advantage.\n\nSchilling was endorsed by the '''', the '''', former Congressman , the , and the '''', among other endorsements.\n\nIn the November 2012 elections, Bustos defeated Schilling by a 53%–47% margin. According to the , Schilling was \"looking forward to focusing again on his pizza business after losing a second term.\"\n\n\n\nIt was widely expected by political analysts that Schilling would challenge Bustos to reclaim the seat in 2014. On July 8, 2013, he officially announced his candidacy for his old seat in the 2014 election. In his announcement, he said Bustos has been failing the middle class, and criticized her for not supporting any budget plans in the legislature.\n\nAccording to '''', Schilling \"historically has not been a strong fundraiser but is known as a skilled grassroots campaigner.\" During 2013, Bustos raised approximately $1.1 million and Schilling raised approximately $297,000.\n\nSchilling was endorsed by the ''''.\n\nSchilling was defeated in the November 4 general election by Bustos, 55%–45%.\n\n\n\n\nSchilling announced he would run as a Republican for Iowa's 2nd District after incumbent representative Dave Loebsack, a Democrat who was first elected in 2006, announced he would retire. He lost the Republican primary to , a state senator and the Republican nominee in , , and .\n\n\nSchilling's wife and 10 children attended the congressional swearing-in on January 5, 2011, attracting some notice and an interview with Diane Sawyer. His early actions as a congressman included joining 25 other freshman Republicans in voting against extending the , claiming that the 45 minutes allotted for floor debate was inadequate to discuss these concerns.\n\nIn February 2011, Schilling joined 130 House Republicans in voting against a $450 million budget cut for an extra F-35 fighter-jet enginea project that the  had repeatedly tried to kill, and that Defense Secretary  called \"a waste of nearly 3 billion.\" Schilling voted for a package of cuts that included a $230 million federal grant to build an  line from  to , though he had supported the project during his campaign, calling it  \"critically important to both the economy and the environment of the Midwest.\" The planned rail line was a celebrated project by many in his district, including local mayors. Schilling defended his vote, arguing it was a question of prioritizing, separating wants from needs, and when he looked at the big picture, the rail service did not make the cut. He also stated that his constituents elected him to address national debt and deficit problems in Washington, not to take a business-as-usual approach.\n\nIn June 2011, Schilling introduced a bill to prevent members of Congress from receiving their congressional pension before they reach the  retirement age.\n\nDuring the , Schilling voted to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nIn October 2011, a California resident issued a death threat promising a reward to anyone who assassinated Schilling. The threat is being investigated by the  and the . Schilling said he was advised by authorities to \"lay low\" while they investigated the threat and a spokeswoman for Schilling said the Schilling family was taking the \"recommended precautions\". According to '''', the person behind the threat may be the one behind similar threats against , several high-ranking current and former security and defense officials, and Rep.  of Colorado. Schilling said, \"It's a general threat to all members of Congress, but they specifically called my name out in the threat. You just don't know what people are thinking...It's something we're not going to take lightly.\"\n\nSchilling gave the Republican response to the  on October 29, 2011.\n\nIn September 2012, Schilling was given the \"Friend of Agriculture Award\" by the  Farm Bureau. In October 2012, he was given the \" Problem Solvers Seal\".\n\n\nSchilling was considered to be a  candidate in the 2010 election. He held the following positions:\n* He was , and spoke at the 2011 .\n* He said the federal government should stop regulating education and that local schools should be under local control.\n* He supported repealing the Democrats' version of health care reform, believing it unconstitutional.

Hanerhoff sold the funeral home to Hultgren's father, and it was called the Hanerhoff-Hultgren Funeral Home until 1987, when it became the Hultgren Funeral Home. The Hultgrens moved from Park Ridge to Wheaton in 1977 and lived upstairs from the funeral home for eight years. Hultgren attended  in , graduating in 1984.\n\nHultgren, whose grandfather was a Baptist pastor, then became the third generation of his family to attend  in , where he earned a  ''magna cum laude'' in  and speech communication in 1988.\n\nHe next moved to  to work as an aide to Republican U.S. Representative  () from 1988 to 1990, where he rose from intern to office manager.\n\nHultgren then returned to his hometown where in 1990 he purchased a small house and was elected Republican precinct committeeman for  Precinct 20 in Wheaton, and began attending the   in Chicago.

In the March 1994 Republican primary, the then 27-year-old first-time candidate Hultgren narrowly edged Wheaton City Councilman Grant Eckhoff by only 252 votes, a margin of less than 1 percent, out of almost 22,000 Republican ballots cast in DuPage County Board District 4. Hultgren received a great deal of support from those who had backed  of Wheaton in Roskam's first campaign for Illinois House District 40 two years earlier.

The new district map (now with only 18 districts, and drawn by the Democratic-controlled ) saw Hultgren's district lose its vast western portion, becoming much more compact and centered around Chicago's outer western suburbs.

The new map drew Walsh's home, along with much of the McHenry County portion of the old 8th, into the 14th. At the same time the 8th was made significantly more Democratic, prompting Walsh to consider challenging Hultgren in the primary for the much friendlier 14th.

In April 2018, after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, Hultgren urged schools and police to do a better job of identifying and intervening with people who are potential threats. “We need to do more to make sure people who are speaking out and acting out or have mental challenges don't get weapons, that people who have criminal histories don't get weapons, and when hearing of a threat we respond quickly,” he said.\n\n\nHultgren favored repealing the  (Obamacare). On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal Obamacare and pass the .\n\nHultgren supported a bill that would allow employers to exclude  receiving health insurance from the  or the  from their list of employees. This would keep their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would  under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\nHultgren and three other members of Congress sponsored the Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act, H.R. 5192, which would require the Social Security Administration (SSA) to take a more active role in preventing identity theft.\n\n\nHultgren endorsed Republican nominee  in the .\n\n\n\nIn 2013 Hultgren voted for legislation stop an increase of the , which led to a  He was the only congressperson from Illinois to vote against an agreement to reopen government and end the government shutdown.\n\n\nHultgren sponsored legislation to permanently repeal the  and voted to repeal it several times.\n\nIn November 2017 Hultgren and  introduced the Bring Small Business back Tax Reform Act as part of the Trump Administration's tax reform package.

The law simplifies reporting requirements for community banks. “The role of smaller financial institutions is especially important in more rural areas, such as my district, where larger banks tend to not have as many branches”, Hultgren said.\n\n\n\nHultgren was a vocal opponent of the , which created new s after the .Matt Taibbi, , ''Rolling Stone'' (May 10, 2012). He called Dodd-Frank \"flawed\" and introduced Republican-backed legislation to end it.

Hultgren had “adopted” Zhu Yufu to highlight his plight as part of the Defending Freedoms Project, a joint effort by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), and Amnesty International USA.

In March 2018 he expressed approval of Congressional sanctions on “Russian individuals and entities” who had engaged in “long-running, coordinated and malicious attempts to influence and disrupt our American elections and political system.” He also welcomed the Trump administration's implementation of the sanctions. “These actions send a clear message that our electoral system is not to be tampered with, and the United States will respond when we or our allies are attacked”, Hultgren said.\n\n\n\n\nHultgren was identified by  as .

We’ve found an incredibly powerful combination, wedding education and research by incorporating universities, user facilities and Department of Energy resources. But this system is only as stable our commitment to it, which is why sustained and predictable research funding is crucial''.''\"\n\nAlong with then United States Senator  (D-CO), Hultgren was awarded the George Brown Science Technology Engineering Leadership award by the Science, Technology, Engineering Working Group, a coalition of pro-science groups including , the , and .\n\nIn October 2012 Hultgren was a recipient of the Champion of Science Award by the Science Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group composed of the 50 leading research universities in the United States.

After law school, McClure served as a prosecutor for nearly six years in the Sangamon County State's Attorney's Office in Springfield, Illinois where he was chief of the Juvenile Division, and later served in the Felony Division.\n\n\n\nIn August 2017, the  Republicans endorsed McClure for  in the 50th district for the 2018 Republican primary, instead of incumbent state Senator . This was a change from the previous Republican primary, when the  Republicans supported . In that 2016 election, McCann won a primary by just over five points despite being opposed by sitting Republican Governor . The 50th district, located in , included all of , , , , and  counties as well as portions of , , , and  counties.\n\nIn September 2017, McClure resigned his position as an assistant state's attorney and officially launched his campaign. In December 2017, Senator McCann announced that he would not seek reelection as a Republican. McClure then won the Republican nomination without opposition. In April 2018,  announced his candidacy for governor as a third-party candidate. McClure was elected to the state senate without opposition in the general election.

The 54th district contains all or parts of , , , , , , , , and  counties. McClure was challenged in the Republican primary by Donald Debolt, who spent $200,000 of his own money on the campaign. Additionally, Debolt was endorsed by state Senator , who became the Republican nominee for governor that year. McClure defeated Debolt by nearly 20 points. McClure was unopposed in the general election.\n\n\n\nMcClure was sworn into the  on January 9, 2019, to represent the 50th district. His first bill that became law was legislation that allowed for special license plates to raise awareness and funds for pediatric cancer research. The bill was filed in honor of Jonny Wade, a resident of Jerseyville, who passed away from cancer at the age of 8. In 2020, McClure and state Representative  passed legislation that made it illegal to post unauthorized private compromising images of another person online and created a court process to allow for a victim to have the images taken down with an emergency order and to recover damages.\n\n;Committee Assignments \nCommittee of the Whole; Agriculture; Criminal Law; Energy and Public Utilities; Higher Education (Minority Spokesperson); Local Government; Public Health; State Government; Supplier Diversity, Special Com.

Later in 2021, McClure introduced and passed legislation to address the  public school teacher shortage and COVID-19 student learning gap. He also passed legislation with state Representative  to make it easier for veterans to get seasonal work at the . In 2022, McClure and Davidsmeyer passed legislation to help schools hire bus drivers.\n\n;DCFS legislation\nIn January 2022,  investigator Deidre Silas was stabbed to death while she was visiting a home in rural  to check on the safety of children. At the time of her murder, DCFS investigators were not allowed to carry any defensive tools with them, including pepper spray. In 2017, DCFS investigator Pamela Knight was murdered by a man who pushed her to the ground and kicked her in the head while she was attempting to take a child into protective custody. In response to these murders, McClure filed legislation to allow DCFS frontline workers to carry pepper spray and establish a new self-defense training course that would include instruction on the proper use of pepper spray in emergency situations. The bill was signed into law by Governor  on May 27, 2022. Senator McClure took part in the course in the spring of 2023, which also included getting sprayed with pepper spray.\n\n;Prisoner Review Board\nDuring Governor 's first years in office, the  Prisoner Review Board, a 15-person body appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate, began voting to release very controversial inmates on parole. However, nine members of the Prisoner Review Board were never voted on or confirmed by the Senate. The  required these nine appointments to be confirmed by the Senate after 60 session days. However, Governor Pritzker was allowing them to serve for up to 59 days, withdrawing their appointments, and then reappointing them days later, which reset the clock and circumvented the Senate. The Senate, made up of a super majority of members of Governor Pritzker's party, chose not to call any of the appointments to be confirmed.\n\nSome of the controversial inmates that the Prisoner Review Board voted to release during this period include the Starved Rock Killer, child murderer and rapist Ray Larson (originally sentenced to 100–300 years in prison), double murderer and rapist Paul Bryant (originally sentenced to 500 to 1,500 years in prison), and Johnny Veal who murdered two police officers (originally sentenced to 100 to 199 years in prison).\n\nAfter the  Prisoner Review Board began making these controversial releases of prisoners, McClure, along with Senators  and , led the efforts to have unconfirmed members of the board receive a vote in the State Senate. McClure, Plummer, and Bryant, who were the only Republicans on the Senate Executive Appointments Committee tasked with vetting all gubernatorial appointments, held a press conference in May 2021 to demand that Governor Pritzker's Prisoner Review Board appointments face a vote in that committee. One of Governor Pritzker's more recent appointments to the Board at the time of the press conference was Max Cerda, a community activist who was also a convicted double murderer.\n\nDespite numerous attempts to force the Prisoner Review Board appointments to receive a vote in the Senate, the Democratic majority refused to call the appointments for a vote. The controversy came to a head when McClure had the chance to question the chair of the Prisoner Review Board in an unrelated appropriations committee hearing in March 2022. McClure asked several times if the convicted double murderer (Max Cerda) serving unconfirmed on the Prisoner Review Board had been voting to release people that he served time with in the Department of Corrections, among other questions. The day after McClure's questions in committee, Governor Pritzker removed Max Cerda from the Prisoner Review Board. In the two weeks that followed, other unconfirmed members of the Prisoner Review Board were finally called before the Senate.\n\nAfter a contentious Senate Executive Appointments Committee hearing in which several Prisoner Review Board appointments faced scrutiny for the first time, one member of the Board resigned, two members were confirmed, and two others were rejected by the full Senate. When Prisoner Review Board member Eleanor Wilson, the final Prisoner Review Board member to be rejected by the Senate, was voted on, she only received 15 confirmation votes out of 59 senators. During McClure's floor speech advocating for Wilson to be rejected, he stated that, \"We need to protect the public. And we need to stick up for victims and their families, no matter where they are in this state.” The Senate did confirm two new members of the Board in the final hours of session so that the Board would have a quorum.\n\n;Prisoner Review Board Controversy Aftermath: According to the , since the controversy, the board has \"tightened up on approving parole.\" Upon analyzing the board's votes, the Tribune reported that for extremely serious crimes that involved lengthy prison sentences, the board went from granting release for more than 40% of the cases in 2021, to granting release for less than 15% of the cases. \"People often ask what Republicans do in the Capitol when you don't have many numbers,\" McClure is quoted as saying in the Tribune story, \"[but] this is probably our biggest accomplishment as Republicans was turning around the PRB.\"\n\n;Committee Assignments\nCriminal Law (Minority Spokesperson); Agriculture; Energy and Public Utilities; Executive Appointments; Local Government; Transportation; App- Criminal Justice (Sub-Minority Spokesperson); App-Health; Redistricting; Redistricting- Chicago South; Redistricting- Southwestern IL; Redistricting- West Central IL (Sub-Minority Spokesperson); Criminal Law- Juvenile Court; Problem- Solving Courts.\n\n\nMcClure began representing the 54th district in the  in January 2023, and continued serving in leadership as Assistant Leader. Additionally, Senator McClure was appointed Floor Leader for the Senate Republican Caucus. In the spring 2023 session, McClure filed and passed Senate Bill 188 to restore parental rights for special needs parents so that they can access medical records for their children without having to go to court. The bill was sponsored by Rep.  in the House and was signed into law in August 2023. Senator McClure also passed HB 2077 which requires dental offices to notify their patients in advance of a closure and ensures that if a dental facility closes, patients can still access their records.

A longtime  member of the , Philip served both the  and the  including a decade as the . He was known as a highly influential politician, both for the projects that he passed and blocked in state government and for his often blunt comments.\n\n, the White House chief of intergovernmental affairs under , deemed him \"one of the most important Republicans in the Midwest\".\n\n\nJames Peyton Philip was born on May 26, 1930, in . He attended , , and . Philip was drafted into the  at the onset of the , though he was not deployed overseas. He was a district sales manager for  for 38 years and retired in 1992.\n\n\nPhilip was elected York Township Auditor in 1965 and was elected President of the Illinois Young Republicans the same year.\n\n\nIn 1965, the  resolved a longstanding reapportionment issue and Philip opted to run for the Illinois House in the 37th district. The 37th district consisted of , ,  and  townships along with the City of  in . He was elected as one of the district's three representatives with  and . During his first term, he was assigned to the Committees on Conservation, Fish and Game; Executive; Industry and Labor Relations. Republican  succeeded Philip as one of three House members from the 40th district as Republican Gene Hoffman and Democrat Bill Redmond were reelected.\n\n\nIn 1974, Republican incumbent  chose to retire from the Illinois Senate. Philip defeated John L. Benzin, a former member of the DuPage County Board of Tax Review, in the Republican primary. In the general election, Philip faced Democratic candidate . In the aftermath of the , Philip won 22,318 votes to Loftus's 20,984 votes; a slim 3.08% margin in then-staunchly Republican DuPage County.\n\nPhilip was chosen as the Illinois Senate Minority Leader in 1981 after the death of Dr. . Philip had been the assistant minority leader since 1979. In January&nbsp;1993, after the Republicans gained a majority in the Illinois Senate, he was elected as President of the Illinois Senate and remained in that role until 2003 when Democrats became the majority. He retired shortly after his unopposed reelection and was replaced by .\n\n\nThe 40th district to which Philip was elected was in northeastern  which would be the center of Philip's various constituencies during his Senate career. In the 1981 reapportionment, the 40th district was renumbered the 23rd district and included all of  and portions of , , , , and  townships. This map, drawn by Democrats, forced Philip to move from Elmhurst to Wood Dale. After Republicans won map-making power in 1991, the 23rd district included all of , , and portions of  in DuPage County and  and  townships in . In the 2001 decennial apportionment, the 23rd district lost its portions that were in Cook County and included all or parts of the localities of , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .\n\n\n\nPhilip's oft-repeated pronouncements that giving more money to the  would be like \"pouring money down a rat-hole\" helped provide the impetus for what Philip said was one of his most important accomplishmentsinstituting a series of reforms that removed power from school boards rife with corruption. The major beneficiary of these reforms was Chicago mayor , who with Chief Executive Officer of Schools  removed previous money-wasting reformers from their posts and closed a $1.4 billion deficit over four years without the need to request more state funding. The legislative reforms also challenged the long-standing assertion from Philip's opponents (notably, the ) that Philip harbored a strong dislike for Chicago and its school system.\n\n\nIn 1990, Mayor , announced his proposal for the , which would have resulted in the demolition of all of , along with portions of  and . The airport faced staunch opposition from Hegewisch residents. Philip opposed the Lake Calumet Airport, believing an airport in , then regarded as an alternate site, would be better suited for an airport. He also opposed the state government paying $2 billion of the airport's costs. In the face of this opposition, Daley declared the airport proposal \"dead\" and focused on plans .\n\n\nPhilip's legislative stances on crime were mixed. With backing from the gun lobby representing downstate hunters, Philip fought to reduce the penalty for illegal possession of firearms to a misdemeanor. However, he also fought to expand the death penalty to apply to all convicted murderers. The proposed legislation he endorsed also proposed mandatory 10–year prison sentences with no chance of parole for using firearms in a \"safe retail zone\", defined as shopping malls, strip malls and commercial districts with more than three stores. Philip expressed a preference for expanding this portion of the law to all gun-related crimes, not just safe retail zones. State's attorneys in the six-county  agreed with Philip's stance on gun crimes, but were mixed with regards to changes in the death penalty.\n\n\nIn June 1984, Philip, then the Republican minority leader of the , helped push through legislation authorizing the construction of a tollway,  , then referred to as simply the DuPage Tollway.\n\n\nPhilip was also known for making numerous controversial comments on various topics throughout his career. Many, including former Illinois gubernatorial candidate , labeled him as both holding and vocally expressing racial prejudice. However, Philip himself said that he was not racist, saying \"When you criticize minorities, whether you're right or wrong, their reaction is it's a racist remark.\"\n\nDuring the corruption trial of former Gov. 's top aide Scott Fawell, \"Pate\" Philip was called as a witness. Prosecutors asked about Philip's 50-year high school reuniona 1999 $15,000 bash at Navy Pier set up by Scott Fawell. Philip said he never asked for any special treatment, but was happily surprised by it. It was only after the '''' revealed the party that Philip paid for it out of his campaign fund.\n\n by Paul Meincke ''''}}\n\nAlso during the trial, prosecutors released a document including ten pages of favors granted to former Senate President Pate Philip.\n\nPhilip spoke with Larry Hall, who wore a hidden recorder and taped the conversations as a part of an undercover government investigation. Philip agreed to try to get Hall's sister a job with the secretary of state's office in exchange for Hall's fundraising activities. Prosecutors allege Hall gave $1,400 to Philip's campaign shortly after the conversation.\n\nPhilip was criticized for looking into the voter histories of students applying for legislative scholarships, which are funded by the taxpayers of Illinois. In 2001, all five of Philip's scholarships went to Republican primary voters or to students whose parents voted Republican, and the same trend was observed over the prior five years.\n\nPhilip, with backing from the gun lobby, fought to reduce the penalty for illegal possession of firearms to a misdemeanor.\n\n\n*'''2002 Race for Illinois Senate   23rd district'''\n**Unopposed\n*'''1998 Race for Illinois Senate   23rd district'''\n**James \"Pate\" Philip (R), 31,347\n**Rita Gonzalez (D), 13,961\n*'''1994 Race for Illinois Senate   23rd district'''\n**James \"Pate\" Philip (R), 29,452\n**Keith Petropoulos (D), 13,100\n*'''1990 Race for Illinois Senate   23rd district'''\n**Defeated William C.

She served in the position for five years until successfully running for the position of comptroller of Illinois .\n\nMendoza ran unsuccessfully in the .\n\n\nMendoza was born in Chicago to Joaquin and Susana Mendoza, who had emigrated from Mexico in the 1960s. The family moved from Chicago's  neighborhood to  when she was a child due to the ongoing violence in Little Village.\n\nMendoza graduated from  in 1990, where she earned All‐State and All‐Midwest honors in varsity . She then attended Northeast Missouri State University (now ) in , on a soccer and academic scholarship, graduating in 1994 with a  in . She played for the soccer team from 1990 to 1994,  during the 1993 season after suffering an injury in the first game. In total, she scored 10 goals and recorded 10 assists in 68 appearances for the Lady Bulldogs.\n\nAfter college, Mendoza moved back to Chicago to live with her family, who had relocated back to Little Village. It was at this time, while working a full-time job, that she became a local community organizer for her neighborhood and got involved in Chicago politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nMendoza became involved with Southwest Side Chicago politics in the mid-1990s. As a young operative, she lost a 1998 bid for the Illinois House. In 1999, she was invited to coordinate the aldermanic runoff campaign of Chicago First Ward incumbent Jesse Granato. Granato had been forced into a runoff by progressive independent candidate Cynthia Soto. Central to the mayor's aggressive development plans, the First Ward election was one of five hotly contested races in independent efforts to oppose the city's patronage political system. Granato's chief support came from then-Mayor  as well as the controversial  and Coalition for Better Government.\n\n\nIn 1998, Mendoza was slated by the regular Democratic Organization but lost to independent progressive incumbent Sonia Silva (1st Legislative District). In 2000, immediately after her victory for Granato and supported by Daley, the Hispanic Democratic Organization, and House Speaker Michael Madigan, Mendoza was slated and elected as an .

Mendoza served as co-chairwoman of the Conference of Women Legislators, and also co-founded the first Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus.\n\nMendoza was a known critic of then Illinois Governor 's staff in 2007. In 2008, Blagojevich blamed Mendoza, along with nine other Chicago Democrats, for lawmakers rejecting his capital bill; he also accused them of holding two taxpayer-paid jobs at once, being paid by the city or state at the same time as collecting salaries as state lawmakers. Mendoza took an unpaid leave from her job as a project coordinator with Chicago when she went to Springfield for legislative business. In her response to Blagojevich, Mendoza stated, \"It is an obvious example that the governor is a pathological liar. If he honestly believes, in his lunacy, that 10 people from the City of Chicago controlled the fate of that doomed capital bill, he needs medical attention.\"\n\nMendoza served as an Illinois Democratic delegate in the primary elections for presidential candidates  in 2000 and  in 2004. In 2002, she visited the African countries of  and  as a delegate for the American Council of Young Political Leaders. In June 2004, the  sent Mendoza to  where she participated in a series of debates in which she represented the National Democratic Party's 2004 presidential platform.\n\n\n\nMendoza was the first woman elected City Clerk in Chicago. In 2011, shortly after being elected, she took charge of an office responsible for more than $100 million in annual revenue from vehicle stickers. Mendoza spearheaded the Companion Animal and Consumer Protection Ordinance which banned Chicago pet stores from selling dogs, cats, or rabbits unless the animals are sourced from humane shelters or animal rescues. She changed the city's once-a-year vehicle sticker sales to year-round sales, saving about $4 million a year.\n\n\nMendoza ran for Illinois Comptroller in the , defeating the Republican incumbent  by 5% of the votes cast.\n\nMendoza was elected during a special election to fill out the remaining two years of the term won by the late Comptroller .\n\nMendoza took office amid a two-year budget impasse between the Governor and the General Assembly. In 2017, '''' named Mendoza to its national list of \"18 to watch in 2018.\"\n\nIn her first year in office, Mendoza introduced and passed the Debt Transparency Act, which provides residents and legislators with a monthly accounting of the debts owed by every state agency. Though then-Governor  vetoed the legislation, Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives overrode the veto unanimously. The State Senate likewise voted to override Gov. Rauner's veto with a 52 to 3 vote.\n\nHer second year in office, she passed| three more Transparency bills: 1) The Truth-in-Hiring Act (requiring governors to list employees on their own payroll), 2) The Truth in Budgeting Act (requiring governors to address the state's Late Payment Interest Penalties in their proposed budgets) and 3) The Vendor Payment Program Transparency Act (requiring lenders to state vendors to disclose their owners and the source of their financing).\n\nIn 2018, Mendoza was re-elected as comptroller, winning 59.9% of the vote in an election against Republican nominee .\n\n\n\n, , Mendoza, , , , , and ]]\n\nOn November 2, 2018, a video leaked from Mendoza's campaign signaling her intention to run for  in 2019 despite her concurrent run for re-election as Comptroller.

Preckwinkle claimed that there were \"a pattern of fraud, duplicate signatures, signatures that don't match addresses and faulty page numbers\". On December 19, 2018, after a petition challenge was held to verify if the signatures supporting Mendoza's campaign were valid, Preckwinkle conceded the challenge as it was discovered that Mendoza had more than 13,000 valid signatures.\n\nMendoza emerged, early in her campaign, as one of the race's leaders in both polling and fundraising. In November and December 2018, publicly released polls consistently showed Mendoza and Toni Preckwinkle to be the top two polling candidates. At this point, the media was characterizing the race as a matchup between her and Preckwinkle, with the two being seen as the race's front-running candidates. Mendoza remained a top contender in polls released in January 2019, but was no longer consistently in the top-two. In February, Mendoza did not place in the top-two in any polls.

However, Hispanic voter turnout was low.\n\nMendoza's campaign was endorsed by labor activist  and .\n\nIn mid-February, Mendoza and fellow contender Lori Lightfoot held a join press statement in which they criticized Preckwinkle for holding a \"Be Fair to Toni\" women-centered campaign rally, which the statement alleged was Preckwinkle falsely of \"playing the victim\". The statement brought up a scandal involving allegations of  that had been lodged against Preckwinkle's former . Around this time, Mendoza was also issuing strong criticisms of fellow contender . In 2024, journalist Gregory Pratt recalled that these attacks hurt Daley's campaign \"particularly with union members.\"\n\nMendoza did not advance to the runoff for mayor, finishing 5th in the primary election with 9.05% of the vote. On March 23, 2019, Mendoza endorsed Lori Lightfoot for mayor in the runoff.\n\n\nIn December 2011, Mendoza married David Szostak, who attended  with her.

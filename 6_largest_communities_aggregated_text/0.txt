In October 2021, he was indicted on charges including , theft in programs receiving federal funds, and . A three week long manhunt ensued after he did not appear for court, which led to a police chase in  in which McGrath was shot and killed by both himself and law enforcement at the same time.\n\n\nMcGrath was born on August 9, 1969, in Greece, to father Howard McGrath, an attorney, and his wife Polyxene. There is some ambiguity about McGrath's legal name.  He is identified as \"Roy Carlos McGrath\" in his marriage license. In the federal and state indictments against him, he is simply referred to as \"Roy C. McGrath\".  According to the FBI's wanted poster for McGrath, he may have used seven different names:  Roy Carlos McGrath, Roy Charles McGrath, Roy Baisliadou, RC Baisliadou, Roy Mak-Grath, and RC McGrath.\n\nMcGrath grew up in Maryland, attending the Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy and graduating from  in 1987. He later attended the , where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in government and politics, and economics in 1993. After graduating, McGrath spent 18 years at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, a trade group based in northern , where he worked in various capacities including vice president of business development.\n\nMcGrath first got involved with politics at 18, becoming a member of the  and later forming a  club in Southern Maryland. In 1991, he served as a congressional intern and assistant to U.S. Representative . In 1992, as the chair of the  Republican Central Committee, he chaired campaign activities for  in the county and later served as an alternate delegate to the , pledged to Bush, and worked on 's unsuccessful congressional campaign in . McGrath later worked on Hogan's  in 2014, serving as the director of the group \"Lawyers for Hogan\" and overseeing early voting and Election Day operations.\n\n\nMcGrath served as a member of Governor-elect 's transition team. He later joined the Hogan administration as a senior advisor and liaison to the  on January 21, 2015. He left this position on July 1, 2015, to become one of Hogan's deputy chiefs of staff.\n\n, 2017]]\nIn December 2016, Governor Hogan appointed McGrath as the Executive Director of the Maryland Environmental Service, (MES) where he described himself as the CEO. While director of the MES, McGrath used state funds on personal expenses, including a $50,935 , $63,000 on remodeling and furniture, and $50,000 on trips to , Miami, Israel, and . He also received employee incentive payments of $117,932 between September 2017 and September 2019. According to legislative investigators, McGrath also personally hired \"loyal colleagues\" to key positions in the agency who were persuaded to donate to Hogan's campaign, even though they did not live in Maryland.\n\nDuring the , McGrath was named by Hogan to the state's Coronavirus Response Team. In this capacity, he spearheaded efforts with , a confidential project that saw the state purchase 500,000  from  for $10 million. According to prosecutors, McGrath began secretly recording meetings with other government officials on his iPhone around this time, which violated Maryland's  laws. It was McGrath's efforts related to the COVID-19 tests that led Governor Hogan to appoint McGrath as his new chief of staff following the resignation of Matthew A. Clark on May 26, 2020.\n\n\nIn August 2020, the '''' reported that McGrath received a $233,647  that included a year's salary after voluntarily leaving the Maryland Environmental Service, which was approved by the agency's board of directors in a private online meeting on May 28. According to federal prosecutors and investigators, McGrath attempted to delete any mention of the compensation from public minutes following the vote. McGrath defended his severance package, writing in an op-ed for ''The Sun'' that he was entitled to a corporate-style  because MES operates \"not much different from a private-sector entity.\" He resigned as chief of staff on August 17, 2020, four days after the story's publication. According to an affidavit obtained by the media, Hogan was first made aware of the payout on August 2, 2020, after MES board member Joseph F. Snee Jr. told Hogan's chief counsel, Michael Pedone, about the payout. After Hogan learned about the payout, McGrath was called to Hogan's office to discuss the matter the following day. Still, it is unclear as to whether Hogan took any further action before the ''Baltimore Sun'' article was released 10 days later. Following McGrath's resignation, Hogan ordered an audit of the Maryland Environmental Service.\n\n leaders of the  quickly questioned the payout, with House Speaker  and Senate President  releasing a joint statement calling its disclosure \"truly shocking\" and asked the Joint Committee on Fair Practices and State Personnel Oversight to hold immediate hearings to look into why the payment was made; the co-chairs of the committee, state senator  and delegate , promised to investigate the payment. Before the committee's first meeting on August 25, McGrath sought Hogan's help, asking him via text message to intervene on his behalf. Hogan did not respond to his texts, instead immediately releasing the texts to the committee. During this first meeting, MES board members testified that they were misled by McGrath into believing that Hogan wanted them to approve the payment. In September 2020, former MES deputy Beth Wojton testified that McGrath routinely prevented her and other employees from seeing expenses related to the Environmental Business Leadership Conference, a series of MES events held each year. Later that month, the committee took the unusual step of authorizing a subpoena for McGrath, who testified before legislators in December 2020. During his testimony, McGrath repeatedly declined to answer questions, invoking the  at least 130 times.\n\nIn September 2020, Democratic leaders of the Maryland General Assembly announced plans to reform the Maryland Environmental Service following McGrath's tenure. In December 2020, legislators introduced the Maryland Environmental Service Reform Act of 2021, which changed the management structure and oversight of the agency. The bill passed and was signed into law by Governor Hogan on April 13, 2021.\n\nIn May 2021, the Joint Committee on Fair Practices and State Personnel Oversight released a report on its investigation into McGrath, which suggested that McGrath flouted state personnel rules, received questionable reimbursements, and mischaracterized the details of his severance payment. The committee's final 82-page report was released in May 2022, which highlighted a pattern of questionable expenses and self-dealing under McGrath's tenure and called on the Maryland Environmental Service to take civil legal action against him.\n\n\n\n of McGrath, June 2021]]\nIn October 2020, '''' reported that both state and federal prosecutors were investigating the severance payments made to McGrath at the end of his tenure as MES director. On October 5, 2021, McGrath was indicted by a  on charges for wire fraud, misconduct in office, and improper use of state funds. He lashed out against state prosecutors in a Facebook post later that week, saying that \"politically-motivated bullies\" were after him and that he was confident \"the exculpatory facts will come to light and speak for themselves\". Later that month,  Magistrate Thomas M. DiGirolamo approved  for McGrath, requiring him to surrender his passport and firearms. In November 2021, McGrath pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in federal court. If convicted, he could have faced up to 140 years in prison.\n\nIn November 2021, McGrath claimed that Governor Hogan had expressed support of his severance package, releasing screenshots of text message conversations between him and Hogan in August 2020, including one where Hogan wrote: \"I know you did nothing wrong. I know it is unfair. I will stand with you\". According to Michael Ricci, Hogan's Director of Communications, the governor sent the message before he learned more details about how McGrath obtained the severance package. Ricci also disputed other emails released by McGrath, calling them a \"complete fabrication\".\n\nIn June 2022, a superseding indictment was issued against McGrath, alleging that McGrath had forged a memorandum from Hogan approving the severance payment.\n\nIn August 2023, the  sought to seize $119,000 in assets from an TD Ameritrade account belonging to McGrath, alleging that the account was entirely funded by his MES severance payment. In October 2024, U.S. District Court Judge  ordered the money to be forfeited to the U.S. government.\n\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the same day McGrath was indicted on federal charges, he was indicted on state charges in  Circuit Court for multiple counts of wiretapping and misconduct for allegedly recording conversations with the governor, cabinet secretaries and other officials without their consent. He was due to stand trial for the state charges in July 2023.\n\n\n for Roy McGrath]]\nMcGrath's federal trial was originally scheduled for October 24, 2022, but was delayed until March 13, 2023. However, he failed to appear in court for the beginning of his trial, prompting U.S. District Court Judge  to issue a warrant for McGrath's arrest. The  launched a manhunt for McGrath, whom they now considered a fugitive. According to a search warrant  and  footage obtained by the media, McGrath did not make reservations to travel to Maryland ahead of his scheduled trial, despite having told his attorney and wife otherwise. During the manhunt, McGrath purchased a used white , had a gun, and used multiple cellphones, which the  used to track him as he went into hiding. \n\nDuring the manhunt, McGrath self-published two books, ''Betrayed: The True Story of Roy McGrath'' and ''Betrayed: The True Story of Maryland Environmental Service'', under the  \"Ryan C. Cooper\". \"Cooper\" declined to give out further biographical details about himself, including his birthday or middle name, only describing himself as a semi-retired man who moved from  to Florida who sympathized with McGrath. In the books, McGrath defended his tenure at the Maryland Environmental Service and provided a tell-all against Governor Larry Hogan, who he claimed had acted out of \"delusional, ego-driven aspirations for the \". A third book was planned to release once more was known about McGrath's location, but never published. Federal officials were able to connect Cooper to McGrath through his own credit card and cellphone signals associated with Cooper's email address that showed McGrath traveling to a \"variety of hotels in different states\" on the East Coast during the manhunt.\n\nOn April 3, 2023, FBI agents sought to arrest McGrath at a  store near the 10700 block of Kingston Pike in . He ignored police trying to arrest him, resulting in a police chase that ended when McGrath was boxed in near a local fast-food restaurant and auto parts store. McGrath ignored demands to put his hands out the driver's side window and told agents that he had a loaded gun, which he fired at his right temple. At the same time, FBI agents fired at McGrath, striking his left cheek. He was taken to the , where he died 30 minutes later. ''The Washington Post'' reported that in a document, law enforcement said they believed McGrath shot himself during the traffic stop, but that it was unclear whether the self-inflicted wound or shots from law enforcement killed him. The FBI concluded its investigation into McGrath's death on July 20, 2023, but were unable to determine whether McGrath or the FBI agent fired the fatal shot.

In 2007, Conway headed a team of 3 incumbent delegates (,  and ) and 7 state central committee members (men  and , and Democrats Sherrod Barnes, Jeremy Rosendale, Beatrice Brown, and Sylvia Williams) to victory with every person on her ticket winning in the September primary. No other 11-person ticket achieved such distinction in the state primary election.\n\n\nA member of Senate from January 8, 1997, to January 2019, Senator Conway was Chair of the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee and a member of the .

The charges were later dropped by State's Attorney .\n\n\nIn a 2005 complaint filed with the Baltimore Circuit Court, Chief liquor inspector Samuel Daniels Jr. accused Conway of acting in collusion with other members of Baltimore's Liquor Board to replace him with her husband, Vernon Conway. At the time the complaint was filed Daniels had been suspended for reasons he claimed stemmed from his attempts to investigate bars on The Block which had quid pro quo relationships with other liquor inspectors and with Senator Conway. Daniels was later found by the city's labor commissioner to have been unfairly suspended and after being reinstated he eventually dropped the charges.\n\nIn 2010, while serving as the chair of the committee that hears alcohol bills, Conway went on the record saying that a bill that would allow wine to be shipped to residents of the state \"is not going anywhere\" despite the fact that 6 of the 9 members of her own committee and both chambers supporting the legislation. Conway cited the fact that it would be difficult for the state to ensure taxes were collected on wine shipped into the state and that it would give minors the ability to tap the internet to obtain alcohol. 37 of the 50 states currently allow wine to be shipped directly to residents.\n\nBut some proponents of the direct-shipping bill question whether she is too personally tied to the system to be fair. Her husband, Vernon \"Tim\" Conway, is a city liquor inspector since 1995 who made $67,000 in his position last year, according to city records.\n\nAccording to a 2008 analysis by The Baltimore Sun, more than 80 percent of state legislators have received campaign contributions from the liquor lobby.\n\n\nIn the 2014 Maryland legislative session, Senator Conway introduced legislation to prevent the use of public college and university funds to support scholarly involvement in academic organizations that have voted to boycott Israel.

First elected to serve on the city council from 2011 to 2016, Mosby was subsequently appointed in 2017 to the , representing Baltimore City's 40th District. He was elected as Baltimore City Council president in November 2020, assuming the role in December of that year. Mosby ran for a second term in 2024, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by city councilmember .\n\n\nMosby was born in the  neighborhood of Baltimore. He attended  where he participated in debate team and served as the student council president. According to classmates, Mosby aspired to be mayor while still in high school.\n\nMosby then attended , where he received his  in  in 2001. Mosby was inducted as a member of  fraternity within the Pi Omega chapter in Baltimore. Mosby then worked as a network engineer and project manager with . Prior to his political career, Mosby served as a Senior Project Manager with .\n\n\n\n and City Councilor ]]\n\nMosby's first attempt for office was as one of seven competitors in the 2007 Democratic primary for the open seat in Baltimore's District 11 City Council seat, vacated by  In this race, competitor  received the endorsement of '''', Maryland Governor  and Congressman , and Mosby went on to place 4th in the election with 10.45% of the vote.\n\nIn 2011, Mosby ran again for city council, this time for the city's 7th district seat (his home neighborhood of  having since been transferred to that district).  The district's incumbent, , was facing scrutiny for allegations including that her primary residence was outside the city, in violation of city law. Mosby cited this negative media coverage, and Conaway's $21 million libel suit against a blogger as an impetus for him to run against her.\n\nIn the intervening years, Mosby had served as a member of the Baltimore City Democratic Central Committee from 2008-2010. Indeed, despite being the challenger, the '''' described the \"politically-connected\" Mosby as the establishment-backed candidate in the race, citing endorsements of him by Governor (and former Baltimore mayor) O'Malley, prominent union groups, the editors of ''The Baltimore Sun'', and the sitting Mayor .\n\nMosby ultimately defeated Conaway and the other challengers in the Democratic primary with a 51% share of the vote. His defeat of the incumbent Conaway was characterized as an \"upset\" in city media.\n\nDespite losing the primary nomination, Conaway launched a write-in campaign for the general election later that year. In a formal complaint to Maryland  , Conaway alleged illegal conduct on the part of Mosby's campaign in the primary relating to the use of the  logo on a mailer and allegations that she had lied on her tax returns, but Mosby's campaign denied any wrongdoing. In November, Conaway further alleged \"major fraud\" in absentee ballots sent for the wrong council district, writing a formal appeal to  , although local officials stated they had received no complaints about the process.\n\nIn spite of the write-in challenge, Mosby still won \"decisively\" in the general election, winning 76.13% of the vote.\n\n\nIn his first year as councilmember, Mosby initially emerged as one of several council allies of Mayor Rawlings-Blake, helping that summer to approve her budget cut proposal, against the amendments of Council President . Mosby voted against a proposal to amend the city charter to require biannual audits of city agencies, a stance which also aligned with the Rawlings-Blake administration. Instead, later that year Mosby put forward a separate bill, proposing a city wide commission \"to provide input on city audits and how they are conducted,\" whose members would all be appointed by the mayor. The city's auditor opposed the move, saying the mayoral appointments would \"jeopardize [their] independence.\"\n\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Mosby questioned Mayor Rawlings-Blake's appointment of , a city outsider, to head the , although he ultimately deferred to her judgment in approving his appointment.\n\nIn July 2013, when 20 city s were shut down as part of Mayor Rawlings-Blake's budget, Mosby spoke in favor of their continued operation under  administration, including one in  re-opened by his fraternity, Omega Psi Phi.\n\nIn 2014, Mosby started the \"Get Fit with Councilman Mosby\" Challenge, partnering with close to 30 s, fitness organizations and chefs, the American Heart Association and  to provide free access to fitness and cooking classes. Mosby called for hearings on the effects of s on children, and proposed legislation that to require warning labels on all advertisements for sugary drinks.\n\nWith the aim to support the , Mosby supported unsuccessful 2014 legislation that sought to reduce littering by imposing a fee on disposable plastic bags used in stores.\n\nIn September 2014, following the contentious appointment of a replacement for another seat on the council (that of  to the 11th district), Mosby supported a special election to replace any further empty seats.\n\nMosby opposed proposed 2015 state budget cuts to the , arguing the cuts would be \"devastating.\"\n\nIn 2016, Mosby was the sole \"No\" vote to limit the influence of the mayor on the city's powerful .\n\nIn August 2016, Mosby voted to raise the city's  to $15, though the bill failed to pass the full city council.\n\n\nIn 2013, Mosby, along with fellow councilmember Carl Stokes, initially opposed the $107 million  deal proposed by the Rawlings-Blake administration meant as incentive for the construction of 's regional headquarters in the Harbor Point section of the city. However, in September, Mosby ultimately voted for the measure.\n\nIn February 2014, Mosby supported Mayor Rawlings-Blakes' proposal for expansion of tax breaks for developers of apartment projects within the city.\n\nWhile praising support for new housing construction across his district and the city, Mosby recognized that investment in jobs and schools would be necessary in addition to development. He criticized Baltimore's affordable housing law as too weak, and sought to place more responsibility on developers to set aside units for low-income renters.\n\n]]\nAs Baltimore overhauled its zoning regulations for the first time in decades, Mosby proposed \"more stringent\" requirements on liquor stores within residential neighborhoods, including a Public Nuisance Prevention Board that would have allowed community members to provide input on when to limit certain kinds of alcohol sales. Mosby criticized his fellow council members, who stripped his proposed amendment by an 11 to 3 vote, as \"cocky\" and \"arrogant.\"\n\n\nIn 2013, Mosby sponsored  legislation, which passed the city council the next year over the opposition of business groups like the Maryland Chamber of Commerce and the . The bill, which Mosby characterized the act as the \"most progressive\" iteration in the country, expanded the city's existing prohibition on asking about criminal history on public job applications to private employers as well.\n\nBaltimore's business community proposed replacing the prohibition with voluntary commitments like \"a pledge to hire a certain number of ex-offenders each year\" During the spring of 2014, Mosby attempted to reach an agreement with the GBC and business interests, but reported that they were unable to come to a consensus, and so the legislation continued. In an attempt to assuage business critics, Mosby drafted an amendment to exclude job postings where a criminal record would be automatically disqualifying. In multiple editorials, the editors of ''The Baltimore Sun'' urged Mosby to accept the GBC's further proposed changes to the law, claiming it would improve Baltimore's perception as \"business-friendly.\"\n\nDespite the opposition, the city council passed the bill 10 to 4 at its April 29 meeting. The final passed legislation applied to private employers with 10 or more employees, where a criminal history would not otherwise bar the candidate (such as in child care). In passing the legislation, Baltimore joined 10 states and about 60 local governments nationwide with similar legislation. Mayor Rawlings-Blake signed the bill into law at the end of May.\n\n\nIn 2012, Mosby proposed a city law, subsequently passed, banning the sale of items to minors by stores where more than 20% of sales were for alcohol. Mosby proposed further restrictions on liquor stores in 2016, requiring that they not \"adversely affect, jeopardize or endanger public health,\" but was unable to gain majority support on the council, who voted to remove his amendment from the final zoning package. Mosby also lobbied to shut down operators of illegal after-hours clubs in his district, which he cited as a source of violence.\n\nIn the hopes of diverting young men from work in the drug trade, Mosby encouraged  projects within his district as an alternative way of making a living. He wrote in support of neighborhood farm activists in their fight to keep plots from being sold by the city for redevelopment. Mosby also worked with local activists in opposition to anti-LGBT violence.\n\nIn August 2013, Mosby worked with fellow councilmember  to close a  in the  neighborhood, following complaints from local merchants about associated crime. The two councilmembers supported increasing police foot patrols in the neighborhood.\n\nFollowing the 2013 , Mosby proposed a non-binding resolution calling on the city of Baltimore to boycott Florida-based businesses in protest.\n\nIn 2013, Mosby's wife, Marilyn, launched her campaign for Baltimore's State Attorney. The two made the city's increasing homicide rate a central part of their program. Beginning in April, the couple organized weekly \"Enough is Enough\" marches, working with police and community groups to reduce crime and violence in West Baltimore. Mosby noted the impact of increased police on suppressing crime in his district in June of that year. ''The Baltimore Sun'' reported Mosby as supporting a \"criminal justice system that is tough on violent offenders and keeps them off the street.\" Following the  in July of that year, Mosby criticized the State's Attorney's level of transparency and communication regarding the investigation.\n\nIn January 2014, Mosby worked with fellow councilman  and community activists to call for greater citizen intervention against rising homicides in the city, in particular a proposal for a \"mobilized street force\" of city residents to patrol the  and  neighborhoods. Mosby and Scott also collaborated in proposing a comprehensive security review of city buildings following a January 2015 security breach at a police station.\n\nIn February 2015, Mosby was a supporter of requiring  for police officers \"as quickly as possible\".\n\n\nDuring the  following the , Mosby's council district included Gray's residence in the  project. Mosby received national coverage for his visible presence during the unrest, and for his calling attention to the roots of the violence. Mosby argued that fundamentally \"folks in West Baltimore [...] don't feel they are part of the process.\" He drew both praise and criticism for his willingness, along with others on the city council, to work with community members including members of gangs in order to bring an end to the unrest.\n\nMosby agreed that the unrest was \"unproductive\" but also the result of decades old of lack of investment and socio-economic decline. Mosby also criticized the 's early handling of the unrest as \"incendiary,\" \"not factual\" and \"problematic at best.\"\n\nFollowing the violence, Mosby advocated for the city to expand its \"Safe Streets\" anti-violence program to the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood. He also praised Mayor Rawlings-Blake's decision to fire police commissioner , saying he hoped it would allow for a \"reset\" of community-police relations.\n\n\nSeveral months after the Freddie Gray unrest, Mosby was reported among those considering a run for . City residents began receiving phone calls polling their potential support for a run in August. Mosby published an op-ed in the ''Sun'' calling for \"political will\" to use data analysis, like the CitiStat program, to modernize the administration of the city. Finally, on October 26, Mosby formally announced his candidacy.\n\nWhen he announced his bid for the mayoral election, Mosby decided to forego a bid for re-election to his seat on the city council.\n\nMosby proposed reforming Baltimore City's Civilian Review Board to include elected seats. Similarly, he (along with several other candidates) proposed the city transition to a partially-elected school board. Recognizing the limits on the city's ability to reform city schools legislatively (as the system is controlled in part by the state of Maryland directly), Mosby promised to provide extra-legislative support for the system, such as increasing use of  members to find recent college graduates to teach in city schools.\n\nAs a candidate, Mosby called for the creation of a city task force \"to help provide free expungements of criminal records, pay fees for Baltimore residents to seek GEDs, cover the cost of vocational training at Baltimore City Community College in certain high-demand job sectors, subsidize apprenticeship programs and refund the income taxes for unemployed ex-offenders to the business that hire them.\" During his candidacy, Mosby opposed granting tax breaks to the operators of the , citing the potential loss of millions in tax revenue without prior study. He also called for the city to sue lead paint manufacturers, and to use the proceeds to remove lead from houses in the city. He also claimed he would eliminate the city's  on  lawsuit settlements. Mosby proposed cutting the city's property taxes and introducing a separate fee for trash pickup.\n\nAlong with most of the candidates, Mosby supported the city's tax increment-financed support of the  redevelopment proposed by  CEO .\n\nIn the televised Democratic Primary debates, opponents implied Mosby would have a potential conflict of interest if elected mayor, as his wife remained the city's state's attorney. Respondents to a non-scientific poll in ''The Baltimore Sun'' said 57% to 41% that they did think it would pose a conflict of interest. In its editorial, the ''Sun'' rejected the idea, arguing Mosby \"deserve[d] the chance to make his case.\" In November 2015, 58% of poll respondents said his marriage would not impact their vote one way or the other (38% said it made them less likely to support him).\n\nIn a November poll, Mosby registered 10% support among likely primary voters. In January, he was reported to have 7% support among primary voters. By mid-March, Mosby was reported to have 6% support. Polling in April showed his support at 4%.\n\nMosby dropped out of the race the week before the primary, though his name remained on the ballot. In dropping out, Mosby endorsed one of the two frontrunners, Catherine E. Pugh, which fueled speculation that he may have been seeking a position with a future Pugh administration, speculation which Mosby denied. Upon Pugh's victory in the primary later in April, speculation then focused on whether Mosby would seek to replace Pugh in the 's 40th district. Mosby ultimately applied for the seat, but the district's central committee selected Delegate  instead.\n\n\nIn January 2017, Mosby applied to the Democratic Central Committee of Maryland's 40th district to replace the outgoing Robinson in her seat in . Mosby was selected after the committee's original choice, Pugh aide Gary Brown Jr., was indicted for campaign finance violations. On taking office, Mosby cited lead abatement, property values and school performance as legislative focuses for him.\n\nThree months after his appointment, Mosby made an unsuccessful attempt to become the head of Baltimore's delegation to the House of Delegates.\n\n\nIn March 2017, Mosby sponsored legislation to assist people affected by .\n\nIn January 2018, Mosby supported plans to demolish and redevelop the Gilmor Homes project in his former city council district.\n\nIn March 2018, Mosby put forward legislation to use state funds to research the effect of Maryland's gun laws.\n\nMosby was a 2019 co-sponsor of legislation to allow lawsuits to be filed in Baltimore courts against manufacturers of lead paint The legislation failed to pass during the 2019 session.\n\nIn January 2019, Mosby joined State Senator Mary Washington to introduce bills prohibiting Baltimore city from placing liens on homes and churches due to unpaid water bills.\n\nWhile serving on the House's  task force in 2019, Mosby suggested eliminating caps on the number of licensed producers in the state in order to avoid excluding racial minority owners from participating in the growing market.\n\nMosby was lead sponsor of a statewide \"Ban the Box\" bill, which was passed but vetoed by Maryland Governor \n\nIn March 2020, Mosby was the lead sponsor of several among a package of ethics, anti-corruption and campaign finance bills that passed the House of Delegates.\n\nMosby supported reforms to Maryland's  system in March 2020, which required courts to consider parent's extenuating circumstances and actual income before assigning the amount of support to be paid, calling them \"definitely incremental steps in the right direction,\" and called for a commission to look into the situation further.\n\nA graduate and supporter of , Mosby sponsored an unsuccessful 2018 House bill to increase Maryland HBCUs funding to compensate for historical losses due to unfair treatment by the state. In May 2019, another Mosby-sponsored bill was successfully signed into law, this one providing up to $240,000 in annual tax credits to historically-black Maryland colleges and universities.\n\nMosby was a critic of proposals in 2019 to move the  from Northwest Baltimore's  to  in neighboring .\n\n\nAs a delegate, Mosby was involved in several bills involving criminal justice and policing. Mosby criticized Governor Larry Hogan's removal of judicial discretion in applying mandatory minimum sentencing laws, arguing they have \"never been an effective way of reducing violence.\" In 2020, he sponsored a bill allowing parole without governor approval for inmates who had served more than 30 years.\n\nIn 2019, Mosby voted against allowing school police to be armed. He was also skeptical of the  proposal for a private police force and voted against the legislation authorizing it. Mosby supported moving Baltimore's police academy at .\n\n\nLate in the summer of 2019, Mosby was reported to be considering a second run for mayor of Baltimore. By October 2019, it was instead reported that Mosby was considering a run for the Presidency of the Baltimore City Council. Mosby announced his candidacy in December.\n\nMosby entered into what ''The Baltimore Sun'' called \"the first competitive race for the position in nearly a decade.\" Mosby was considered an early frontrunner in the race, with a February poll showing him receiving 26% of support, with his closest competitor, former council member Carl Stokes, receiving 10% support.\n\nHe received the endorsement of Mayor Jack Young in March. In May, Mosby received the endorsement of ''The Baltimore Sun'' in the Democratic primary election. In the primary, held June 2, Mosby was the victor, winning with 40.2% of the vote.\n\nPrior to the general election, Mosby received the endorsement of the  on November 2. He easily won election in November, defeating his Republican opponent with 79.5% of the vote.\n\nIn March 2021, ''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that federal prosecutors had opened a criminal investigation into Mosby and his wife, State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, subpoenaing her campaign and the couple’s business records.\n\nMosby ran for a second term in 2024, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by city councilmember .\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Mosby married  (née James), who subsequently became the  of . The two are often referred to as a \"power couple\" in Maryland politics. Shortly after his wife's election, Mosby stated he would recuse himself from any prosecutor-related matters in the city council, following speculation that the two might influence each other's actions in office.\n\nOn July 21, 2023, the Mosbys filed for divorce.\n\n\nIn October 2020, a $45,000 tax lien was filed against the property of Nick Mosby and his wife, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, for three years of unpaid federal taxes (2014, 2015, and 2016). Nick Mosby stated that he has been \"in ongoing conversations with the IRS\" about resolving this issue. That same month, it was reported that Mosby's consulting company, Monumental Squared LLC, was listed as sharing its address with a developer who was also a major campaign donor to Mosby. Later in October, Mosby received scrutiny over his joint ownership of a rental property that was reported to be unregistered with the city, and not listed as lead-certified. Mosby's co-signator on the mortgage argued that Mosby had no direct involvement in the renting of the home, nor in evictions from it.\n\nMosby stated the debt was a result of an early withdrawal from his retirement savings that he used to cover \"family tragedies.\" Mosby subsequently reported the tax lien was paid off in full.\n\nDuring Marilyn Mosby's federal trial for mortgage fraud, Mosby testified that he lied to the public about the status of his taxes.

She ran unsuccessfully for governor of Maryland in .\n\nIn 2010, Townsend became the chair of the non-profit American Bridge, an organization whose focus is to raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes. Since 2021, she has served in the  as an advisor on retirement. She is a member of the prominent political , and is the oldest grandchild of  and .\n\n\nShe was born in , the eldest of  and 's eleven children. She is named after her paternal aunt . She is the eldest grandchild of  and . Kennedy spent her childhood between the family's homes in  and . While she was growing up, it was not assumed that the girls in the politically oriented Kennedy family would run for office. However, after her uncle President  was assassinated, her father wrote her saying, \"As the oldest of the next generation you have a particular responsibility. ... Be kind to others and work for your country.\" Her family gave her the nicknames \"Clean Kathleen\", \"the Nun\", and \"the Un-Kennedy\".\n\nOver the summer of 1964, Kennedy won four blue ribbons for her \"excellence in horsemanship\". On August 29, 1965, the fourteen-year-old Kennedy was somersaulted by her horse while competing at Sea Flash Farms in . She was left unconscious and bleeding internally and was rushed to , located fifteen miles away. Her family was en route to  at the time of the incident and was not located for another three hours.\n\nShe was sixteen when her . The night he was shot at the , Kennedy and her two eldest brothers, Joseph II and Robert Jr., were being flown to Los Angeles aboard one of the planes in the Secret Service's presidential fleet named \"the ''Jet Star''\".\n\nShe was educated at Our Lady of Victory Elementary School in Washington, D.C., and later graduated from  in . She attended  of , receiving her  in history and literature in 1974. She then studied at the , receiving her  degree in 1978.\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Kathleen worked as an attorney at a private , Clendenen & Lesser, in , while her husband, David Townsend, attended . In 1982, she was admitted to the , and worked as a  for U.S. District Court Judge . She also worked on her uncle , stumped for local Democrats, and was hired as a  for   in the early 1980s while she and her husband resided in .\n\nIn 1984, the family settled in the , in her husband's home state. In 1985, she was admitted to the . In 1986, Townsend became the first  member to lose a  when she ran for the  in Maryland's strongly Republican , using the name Townsend only. Incumbent Republican  defeated her 59% to 41%.\n\nAfter her failed congressional bid, Townsend went to work for the state government of Maryland, holding numerous posts including assistant . In 1993, Townsend took a job at the  overseeing grants to local police departments and community groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1994,  was running for  in a highly contested primary against then-Lt. Governor  when he selected her as his running mate. Experts did not believe she would be an asset, but her name recognition (she now used the name Kennedy Townsend) and her fund-raising skills helped him to win.\n\n\nIn the general election, Glendening and Townsend beat Republican candidate  in one of Maryland's closest and most controversial gubernatorial elections. After unofficial results indicated that Sauerbrey had lost the election by a narrow margin, she began making what ''The Washington Post'' called \"sensational charges\" that the election had been stolen. Sauerbrey's allegations included ballot box stuffing, 100% voting in one precinct, voting by numerous dead people, and what she called the Kennedy \"precedent\"that unproven rumors that John Kennedy had stolen the 1960 Presidential election proved that his niece Townsend had stolen this election.\n\nThe official vote tally declared Glendening the winner by 5,993 votes out of 1.4 million. Sauerbrey hired an election specialist known for aggressive tactics then filed a lawsuit alleging that 50,000 votes had been cast illegally. By the time the hearing began in January 1995, however, Sauerbrey had backed away from the fraud charges and her claim centered on sloppy election procedures and 3,600 challenged ballots. The number of challenged ballots would not have been enough to change the result even if all of them were thrown out. The judge ruled that about 1,800 votes had been cast in  by people whose names should have been purged from the rolls, but said that there was no clear and convincing evidence that fraud or procedural errors had affected the outcome. Sauerbrey dropped the suit three days before Glendening was to be inaugurated, but still maintained her belief that she had won the election.\n\nSauerbrey ran against Glendening again in , but this time Glendening and Townsend won by a much wider margin (55% to 44%).\n\n\nDuring her tenure as lieutenant governor, Townsend focused on  and promoting . Under her leadership, Maryland became the first state to require  as a prerequisite to high school graduation. Townsend's \"HotSpot Communities Initiative\" collaborated with law enforcement and government agencies to design and implement a comprehensive enforcement and prevention strategy at targeted high-crime areas. Her \"Break the Cycle\" program required offenders on parole or probation to take frequent s.\n\nDuring the , Townsend travelled to  to campaign for . \n\n\nIn the , Townsend faced   and   in the general election.\n\nDuring the campaign, Townsend was criticized for her choice of running mate,  , a novice politician who had switched parties only a few weeks before. Some also criticized the choice of a white male as unlikely to help minority turnout. Ehrlich's running mate was , an  lawyer who had been chairman of the Republican Party of Maryland.\n\nThough Maryland traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican governor in almost 40 years, Townsend lost the race, gaining 48% of the vote to Ehrlich's 51% and Lancaster's 1%. Ehrlich became only the seventh Republican governor in state history. In the end, most observers agreed she ran a weak campaign. They specifically cited a lack of planning, claiming that she hastily booked campaign stops in rural areas hostile to her. '''' said the defeat derailed her political career, at least in the short run.\n\n\nTownsend, along with siblings  and , endorsed  for president in the 2008 Democratic primaries.\n\nTownsend wrote the book ''Failing America's Faithful: How Today's Churches Are Mixing God with Politics and Losing Their Way'', published in 2007.

Four months later, Townsend and four of her siblings endorsed Democratic Vice President 's  in the , and denounced their brother Robert Jr.'s decision to endorse former President , calling the move a \"betrayal\".\n\n\nIn 1973, she married David Lee Townsend (born 1947), whom she had met when he was a graduate student and her tutor at Radcliffe.

In 1984, Mitchell was on the advance staff of 's .\n\nIn 1990, Mitchell got a license to work as a , which he renewed in June 1997. He reportedly oversaw several family bond and insurance companies. His connections to the bail-bond business led to criticisms of conflict of interest in 1999 during his Senate term, at which time he said he did no work outside of his elected office.\n\n\nMitchell was a State Senator from Maryland's  from January 1999 to January 2003, and prior to that a State Delegate from the same district from January 1995 to January 1999. Mitchell held the same Senate seat once held by his father, Clarence M. Mitchell III, and uncle Michael B. Mitchell.\n\nDefeated for reelection to the Senate in the 2002 Democratic primary, Mitchell described his loss as party establishment punishment for his successful opposition to Gov. 's redistricting plan that ended with the Maryland Court of Appeals finding the map unconstitutional, but reporting also mentioned Mitchell's support for successful Republican gubernatorial candidate  and an ethics reprimand from the General Assembly. Mitchell said he would leave the Democratic Party in December 2001 because the governor's legislative redistricting map, by merging the 47th district into his 44th, hurt minority representation. Mitchell was publicly reprimanded in February 2002 for accepting a $10,000 loan as a State Delegate in 1997 from businessmen (including two city bail bondsmen) with issues before the legislature, a loan on which no payments had been made five years later. Mitchell received a letter from the State Ethics Commission of Maryland stating that he did not violate any ethics rules. Mitchell also received a letter, very rarely issued, by the State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli stating that he did not violate any state laws. Mitchell was also fined $350 in 2001 for failing to submit required annual financial disclosure forms in a timely manner.\n\nMitchell endorsed Republican  for governor in May 2002. After Ehrlich won the general election, Mitchell was hired as the director of the newly created Office of Urban Development in the Department of Housing and Community Development. Two weeks later Mitchell was forced to resign just before the nominee for secretary of that department faced a Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n\nIn 1995, Mitchell participated in a radio show, \"The Mitchells' Maryland Magazine\", hosted by his father Clarence M. Mitchell III and his sister Lisa Mitchell on . Starting in 2007, Mitchell hosted ''The C4 Show'', a  on  in Baltimore. On January 2, 2012, following the death of fellow radio host , Mitchell's program was expanded to four hours, running 10 AM to 2 PM, Monday-Friday, while dropping Saturdays. At some point the show was shortened, as on July 8, 2013, it was reported that it would be expanded from two hours to three hours, 9 AM to noon.

The budget was amended to reduce this funding to $100 million, but also gave the governor the ability to tap the state's \"rainy day\" fund for an extra $100 million.\n\nIn July 2023, after the  announced that the opening of the  would be delayed until spring 2027, Moore promised to complete the Purple Line during his tenure and to prevent future delays. After the Purple Line was further delayed in March 2024, Moore blamed his predecessor, Larry Hogan, for creating \"boondoggles of challenges\" that led to delays on the rail line project.\n\nIn December 2023, facing a long-term budget shortfall, Moore announced a six-year plan to cut the state's transportation budget by $3.3 billion, or eight percent, including a $1.6 billion cut to \"all major highway expansion construction projects\" and a $652 million cut to transit expansion projects. The proposed plan would reduce commuter bus services and lines, delay the state's transition to es, and cancel plans to expand the . He later announced a one-year infusion of $150 million to the state's transportation fund, with most of the added funding being used to restore highway user revenue funding, to ease the effects of the cuts. Although the legislature included provisions to raise fees on vehicle registration for electric vehicles and heavier cars to prevent drastic cuts to the state's transportation projects, the Moore administration again proposed $1.3 billion in cuts to Maryland's transportation budget in September 2024, which would delay various infrastructure projects around the state, including the widening of the  and the state's transition to electric buses.\n\nIn March 2024, following the , Moore declared a state of emergency and called the disaster a \"global crisis\". He also thanked Maryland Transportation Authority Police officers for closing the bridge after receiving mayday calls from the '''', which prevented additional deaths during the collapse. In the legislature, Moore supported the PORT Act, a bill introduced by Senate President  to provide $60 million in financial assistance to workers and businesses affected by the subsequent closure of the  and introduced a bill that would create a permanent state scholarship for the children of surviving spouses of maintenance workers killed during the bridge collapse, which was later amended into the PORT Act.\n\nIn October 2024, Moore said he supported the widening of .\n\n\n\nBefore taking office, Maryland's economic outlook was among the lowest in the nation, according to the . Over the past decade, the state's  (GDP) had only grown by 11 percent, compared to a 23 percent growth nationally, and ranked in the bottom 10 states in several economic factors, including economic momentum, change in personal income, and population growth. At the same time, the state had a $2.5 billion budget surplus from a combination of  and a tightening of state spending, $2.9 billion in its \"rainy day fund\", and low unemployment numbers.\n\nDuring the 2023 legislative session, Moore introduced the Innovation Economy Infrastructure Act, which would provide $10 million in grants for \"infrastructure projects in eligible technology sectors\"; the Access to Banking Act, which incentives banking institutions to locate in low- and moderate-income areas of the state; and the Broadband Expansion Act, which initially offered tax incentives to the broadband internet industry but was later watered down to a bill to study how to incentivize broadband expansion. All three bills were signed into law in May 2023.\n\nIn May 2023, Moore signed an executive order creating the Innovation and Impact Council, which would investigate ways the state could partner with businesses and nonprofits to address social and equity issues. In June, he signed another executive order to establish the Maryland Economic Council, which was tasked with developing economic development strategies for the state.\n\nIn August 2023, following a report from the Maryland Department of Legislative Services predicting that the state's budget deficits would increase to $1.8 billion annually by 2028, Moore cautioned that the state would enter a \"season of discipline\". He also pledged to hire a chief performance officer, later naming Asma Mirza, the deputy for implementation management for the White House Infrastructure Implementation Team, to the position.\n\nIn October 2023, Moore said he would support giving municipalities the ability to designate local \"tourism zones\".\n\n\n union members, 2023]]\nBefore taking office, the Maryland Department of Legislative Services reported a \"historically high\" level of vacancies in state government, with only three departments in the executive branch having vacancy rates lower than 10 percent. During his campaign, Moore promised to fill 5,000 vacancies within his first year in office, and included raises up to 18 percent for state employees to incentivize recruitment and retention. As of October 2023, only 791 positions had been filled, according to data from the Maryland Department of Legislative Services.\n\nIn February 2023, Moore said he would scrap the 's controversial contract process to run concessions operations at . In March, he promised to include a \"labor peace\" agreement in future BWI concessions operations contracts. The BWI contract bidding process restarted in September 2023, and includes provisions to include the labor peace agreement, which would allow service workers to unionize but prohibited .\n\nDuring the 2024 legislative session, Moore will introduce the Families Serve Act, which would allow employers to give preference to s in hiring; and the Time to Serve Act, which doubles the amount of days of leave state employees can take to fulfill duties in military reserves. He also supported bills to ban discrimination toward military members in hiring.\n\n\nDuring his campaign, Moore said that he would accelerate the state's incremental increase to a minimum wage of  by 2023. He also supports indexing the state's minimum wage to inflation. At the beginning of the 2023 legislative session, Moore introduced the Fair Wage Act, a bill that would accelerate the state's minimum wage build-up to reach $15 an hour by October 2023 and index the minimum wage to the  starting in July 2025, with increases capped at five percent per year. The Senate Finance Committee amended the bill to remove provisions linking it to the consumer price index and delayed the wage increase until January 1, 2024. Moore signed the bill into law on April 11, 2023. He also allocated $218 million in his first budget to support state service providers in keeping up with the accelerated wage increase.\n\n\nDuring his tenure as CEO of the , Moore pushed for New York legislators and Governor  to expand the state's child tax credit, and lobbied for the issue to be mentioned in Cuomo's State of the State speech.\n\nDuring his campaign, Moore repeatedly said that he does not anticipate raising taxes as governor, but said in September 2022 that he planned to work with the legislature to fix what he described as the state's \"upside-down taxation system\". In January 2024, he expressed openness to raising taxes to address the state's budget shortfall, but said that any conversation about taxes would have a \"very high bar\".\n\nIn May 2022, following a spike in gas prices as the result of the , Moore said he supported staving off automatic increases to the state's , arguing that voters needed immediate relief and later calling it a \"regressive tax\". In September 2022, Moore told the Maryland Family Network that he would support child care programs by subsidizing the service through tax credits for low-income families. He also expressed interest in eliminating either the state's  or  to make the state more attractive to retirees. In June 2023, Moore said he supported shifting transportation funding away from the state's gas tax as well as decoupling it from inflation, but opposed calling a special session to do so, instead preferring to pass tax reforms during the 2024 legislative session.\n\nIn his first budget in January 2023, Moore introduced the Family Prosperity Act, which allocates $171 million toward making permanent the  passed by lawmakers in 2021, and the Keep Our Heroes Home Act, which provides $33 million for expanding tax exemptions for military retirement income; legislators later scaled down the Keep Our Heroes Home Act to only raise the state's income exemption limit to $20,000 for older veterans and $12,500 for younger ones. Moore signed both bills into law in April and May 2023, as well as another bill to allow workers to deduct  from their .\n\n\n in 2010]]\nIn September 2010, Moore testified in support of reauthorizing the  federal assistance program. In July 2021, he opposed Governor Hogan's decision to end expanded federal unemployment benefits provided by the  early. In December 2022, Moore said he supported indexing the state's maximum unemployment insurance payment to inflation.\n\nIn August 2022, Moore supported protests led by veterans at the  to pass the , which would provide benefits for veterans exposed to s and other toxic phenomena.\n\nDuring his gubernatorial campaign, Moore said he supported establishing a state \"\" program, which would cost roughly $100 million per year and be seeded with $3,200 for every child born on Medicaid, to target the racial . If enacted, it would be the largest baby bond program ever enacted in the United States.\n\nDuring the 2024 legislative session, Moore introduced the ENOUGH Act, a bill to provide $15 million in grants toward underserved communities.\n\n\n\nMoore met  in  in 2002.

His father, a graduate of , moved the family to Baltimore in 1952 to take a job as Dean at Morgan State University and assistant rector at the . Anderson's parents divorced in 1957, and he and his two sisters were raised by his mother.\n\n\nAnderson attended primary schools in Baltimore and . In 1964, he entered the . He was the captain of the  and track teams and won a scholarship to . Anderson majored in political science and made the freshman and varsity football and freshman track teams. But in the fall of 1969, Anderson left Rutgers at the end of the semester. In 1973, he entered  where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. He also played on the legendary \"\"  team, the only black college lacrosse team in America.

Anderson was first hired by WBAL in 1976 as a reporter where he regularly covered the state legislature, , produced features and even boxed a round with  as a feature story in 1978.\n\nIn 1980, Anderson was hired by WMAR-TV to be the station's weekend anchor and reporter. He covered events such as the  trial in  and the Cuban refugee influx in Pennsylvania. In April 1982, Anderson was let go by WMAR-TV following a 90-day labor strike.\n\nThough he interviewed for jobs at  in Atlanta and  in Boston, Anderson chose not to move his family and remained in Baltimore. He ran for the Maryland House of Delegates while entering law school.\n\n\nAnderson graduated from the  in 1987 and passed the Maryland  in 1988.

As chairman he sponsored and saw the passage of Maryland's Minority Business Enterprise Act. One of the benefits of this act for minority business was increased participation in major state projects like the building of . Nearly 20% of the contracts let for the construction of the new ballpark went to minority-owned businesses.\n \nIn 1993, Anderson was appointed to the  All-Star Game host committee; the entity that planned the activities around  to be played in Baltimore. Anderson, the only African-American on the 12 member committed persuaded the group to invite  to speak the pre-game National Anthem, backed up by the   Choir. The committee had planned to invite  to sing the Anthem.  Anderson also worked with  to sponsor a step show competition for local black fraternities at the stadium during the week of the All Star game festivities.\nAfter 12 years in the House, Anderson ran for the  in 1994 but was defeated in the Democratic primary. He practiced law for the next 8 years. In 2002, he made a run for the House of Delegates. As before he was a non-incumbent running against four incumbents for three seats. Unlike his first race in 1982 where he beat all the incumbents and finished first, this time Anderson finished third with a razor-thin 100-vote margin of victory over 4th-place finisher incumbent Ken Montague.

Delegate Anderson organized protests against slots, wrote newspaper editorials  and took to the airwaves at several local radio and television stations to solidify opposition to bringing organized gambling into Maryland. In spite of strong support for slots by then Maryland Governor , Anderson and his colleagues prevailed and a pro-slots bill never made it out of the House of Delegates though similar bills had passed the State Senate. In 2005, however, both chambers passed different pro-slots bills. In the House of Delegates the measure passed by a 71–66 vote.

The Maryland State Commission of Sentencing Guidelines is also considering changing sentencing guidelines for low level felony drug offenders. \nAdditionally, Anderson was the House of Delegates floor leader on legislation that would automatically expunge the records of the thousands individuals who have been arrested in Baltimore City without being charged with a crime.

The bill was signed into law by the Governor in May 2008.\n\n*'''2009'''\n\nIn the 2009 session, Anderson introduced two bills aimed at strengthening Maryland's drunk driving laws: HB330 (Manslaughter and Vehicular Manslaughter -Penalties) and HB 212 (Preliminary Breath Test – Evidence).

In January 2022, Scott declined requests from housing advocates to institute an eviction moratorium in Baltimore, saying that he didn't have the power to do it on his own and that action would need to come at the state level.\n\nScott tested positive for  on October 4, 2021.

He also rallied on reforming police spending after leading the charge to cut $22.4 million from the city's $550 million police budget, half of which was for \"unallocated\" funds. Despite this, Scott's first budget, introduced in April 2021, included a $28 million increase in the city's police budget. This proposed increase was met with criticism by Baltimore residents. Scott pushed back against this criticism by asking people to \"look at the full picture behind violent crime rather than the \"simple conflict\" that leads to the loss of life.\" His budget was approved without amendments on June 8, 2021. In April 2022, Scott again proposed a $5 million increase in the city's police budget, which was met with further criticism.\n\nIn January 2022, Scott implemented the Group Violence Reduction Strategy in the city's Western Police District.

The program then in turn hopes to allow officers more time to engage positively with communities and build trust.\n\nIn June 2022, Scott filed a lawsuit against , alleging the company flooded the city with s which he believes contribute to bloodshed in the city's streets; the lawsuit was settled for $1.2 million in February 2024.

He also defended the role of the police and the city's Safe Streets gun violence program against criticism, saying the focus should \"instead be on a few people who cowardly decided to shoot up a big block party celebration for a community\".\n\nIn March 2024, '''' reported that homicides and shootings overall were trending downward city-wide since 2022.\n\n\nIn May 2021, Scott removed owner-occupied homes that faced tax sale s from the city's annual tax sale, an online auction that the city uses to collect overdue bills. In September 2021, he announced that Baltimore would purchase the liens of 454 owner-occupied homes to keep them out of the city's tax sale process. In April 2022, Scott removed all owner-occupied homes from the city's tax sale and postponed the auction until June.\n\nIn May 2021, Scott delivered his first veto of his mayorship on a bill that would give renters more options when paying security deposits.\n\nIn June 2021, Scott launched a fund to cover up to $2,000 in security deposits for low-income tenants, funded with $3.3 million in supplemental funds from a fiscal year 2020 pandemic-related .\n\nOn January 25, 2022, a fire at an unoccupied rowhouse building killed three firefighters and left another on life support. In response to the fire, Scott announced a citywide review of its operations related to vacant properties.\n\nIn February 2022, Scott announced that the city would spend $90.4 million in funding received from the  to purchase two hotels to provide 275 beds for the city's homeless population.\n\nIn December 2023, Scott's administration joined other community leaders in announcing an $8 billion plan to revitalize some parts of the city blighted by abandoned or vacant properties. In March 2023, the administration announced its support for a Baltimore City Council proposal to make some vacant properties available for purchase starting at $1, though critics of the proposal have suggested that such a policy would not directly benefit current residents or legacy residents of Baltimore.\n\n\nIn April 2022, Scott announced a  pilot program to provide 200 young parents between the ages of 18 and 24 with payments of $1,000 per month over two years.

Leggett was elected  of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office.\n\n\nLeggett was born on July 25, 1944, in  and grew up with twelve siblings in . In Alexandria, he played  for . He attended  in , working through school as a groundskeeper in a work-study program and graduating in 1967. In his time as an undergraduate, he was a student leader in the  movement and twice met  He led the on-campus civil rights movement while at the same time commanding the   (ROTC) unit. He was elected president of his class during his senior year and is a member of , the first intercollegiate fraternity established for African-Americans. In 1968, Leggett served as a captain in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, first in combat with a Military Advisory Unit attached to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and then as a public affairs officer with the 7th Support Battalion/199th Light Infantry Brigade. He was awarded the Bronze Star for Service. In 1974, he received  and  degrees from  in , graduating first in his law school class, followed soon after by a Master of Laws degree from . He returned to Howard as a professor in their law school in 1976 and continued teaching at the law school through his election as County Executive in 2006, except for a stint as a  under President  in 1977.\n\n\nLeggett's first participation in county government was as an appointed member of the Montgomery County Human Relations Committee, on which he served from 1979 to 1986. He was later named Chair of the committee. In 1986, he was elected as an at-large member of the Montgomery County Council, becoming the first African-American ever to serve on the council. To this day, only one other African-American has been elected to county government office at large. He was re-elected to the seat three more times, and served three one-year terms as council president. During his time on the council, he chaired the council's transportation and environment committee and played a role in passage of a county living wage law and a public . In 1992, a former county council aide of Leggett's accused him of sexual harassment in a widely publicized case, but the accusation was dismissed by a jury. In 2002, Leggett declined to run for re-election to the county council. He was widely viewed as a potential running mate for Democratic nominee  in that year's gubernatorial race. However, Townsend chose Admiral  instead. Townsend and Larson lost in November when Maryland elected  to be its first Republican governor in 40 years and Lieutenant Governor  as its first African-American statewide elected official. When his term on the council was completed in December of that year, Leggett was elected as chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party. Leggett's chairmanship was seen by some Democratic activists as important to maintaining the African-American base of the Maryland Democratic Party and rebuilding the party's strength following the 2002 gubernatorial loss.\n\n\nFollowing the election of 2004, Maryland politicians started announcing their intentions for the . Among them was three-term County Executive , who was in the early stages of a run for governor. In December 2004, Leggett left his position as Chair of the Maryland Democratic Party to begin a  to replace Duncan as Montgomery County Executive. In the Democratic primary election Leggett squared off against a former colleague from the council, . Leggett and Silverman engaged in a long series of debates beginning almost a year before the election. But despite being outspent by Silverman by more than five to one, Leggett won the Democratic nomination for executive by 61.3 percent to 35.5 percent in the primary election on September 12, 2006. He then faced Republican nominee Chuck Floyd and independent anti-tax advocate  in the general election. Leggett easily won the November election with 68 percent of the vote to Floyd's 22 percent and 10 percent for Ficker. He carried 239 of the county's 241 voting precincts.\n\n\nIn the early days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of controversial issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened in the midst of a state budget crunch and in response to high levels of  in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming  . Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.\n\nLeggett dealt with the major local issue of a hiring site for ers from the city of  and the surrounding upper county area. During the term of Leggett's predecessor , Gaithersburg had struggled to find space within the city limits that the county could lease for use as a location where the day laborers could wait for employers. The owners of virtually all of the more than 30 sites considered by the city government had refused to grant a lease for this purpose, and in the one case where the property owner was willing to consider the use, the county's efforts to lease the property fell through after the property owner backed out. The debate became caught up in a larger national debate about the role of  in American society. Leggett located a site for day laborer center on county-owned land with his first several months in office. Despite opposition from anti-immigrant voices, the center has served hundreds of workers and employers without incident.\n\n\nLeggett was unopposed in the 2010 Democratic Party primary for County Executive. In the general election, he was opposed by Republican Party candidate Douglas Rosenfeld. In the November balloting, Leggett won reelection with 66 percent of the vote to 34 percent for Rosenfeld, carrying 227 of the county's 252 precincts.\n \n\nLeggett won the Democratic nomination for a third term, gaining 45 percent of the vote to 33 percent for former county executive Doug Duncan and 22 percent for councilmember Phil Andrews, and winning 80 percent of county precincts. In the fall general election Leggett defeated the Republican candidate James Shalleck by 65-35 percent, winning 212 of 245 voting precincts. Leggett declared before the passage of term limits in the county in 2016, that he would not run for re-election.\n\nLeggett was elected as president of the Maryland Association of Counties in January 2015. In January 2017, he vetoed a bill which would have gradually raised the county minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020.\n\n\n\nLeggett is currently married to his second wife, Catherine.\n\nLeggett and his wife are longtime philanthropic supporters of , with Catherine receiving an honorary degree in 2019.

Tarrant''' (born July 30, 1965) is an  who represented the 40th legislative district in the  from 2007 to 2015. Tarrant was a member of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, Insurance Subcommittee and secretary to the .\n\n\n\nTarrant graduated from  in 1989 with a  degree in finance/marketing. Tarrant has been employed for the past 17 years by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. He currently serves as the director of state policy. In this role, he ensures patients with Medicaid as their insurance have access to the entire portfolio of life-saving medications sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In previous positions, he has helped municipalities and cities conduct  testing and awareness programs.\n\nTarrant is a member of the NSU Prince Georges Alumni Association Chapter. In 1985, Tarrant was initiated into the Epsilon Zeta chapter (NSU) of  fraternity. He is a life member of NSU National Alumni Association and Kappa Alpha Psi.\n\n\n\nPrior to running for office, he was the president of Ashburton Area Association from 1994 to 1999, a community improvement group in his neighbourhood. He created several long-standing programs and is most proud of the success achieved in re-zoning Ashburton to an R-1 zone status (i.e., allowing single-family-only dwellings). He is a frequent speaker on improving housing and zoning codes. Tarrant is also very committed to public school education, having served 6 terms as a PTO (Parent Teacher Organization) board member and vice president of the PTO at his children's public elementary school.\n\n\n\nTarrant's first session in the Maryland House of Delegates was 2007. Tarrant served for 8 years in the Maryland General Assembly, passing over 30 bills during his tenure. He led the charge of the initiative to increase taxes by 70% on cheap, candy-flavored cigars targeting urban youth. He is most proud of his legislation that protects student privacy by banning university coaches, faculty and administrators from asking students for their private user names and passwords. This legislation has become the policy for University of Maryland Systems.\n\n\n\nTarrant was the president and vice president of his neighborhood association in the Ashburton community for 12 years. He was the vice president of Mt. Washington Elementary School PTO for 5 years. He is also a deacon at Union Baptist Church, on Druid Hill Avenue, in Baltimore.\n\n\nDuring the four-year term prior to Tarrant's candidacy for the House of Delegates, two of the delegates,  and Tony Fulton, died while in office. Marshall Goodwin and Catherine Pugh were appointed to finish their terms. Rawlings and Fulton were Democrats, as are Goodwin and Pugh. Prior to the 2006 Democratic primary, the only incumbent delegate in the district, Salima Marriott, decided to run for the Senate seat being vacated by the district's senator.  Catherine Pugh also decided to run for the same seat leaving the newly appointed Goodwin as the only incumbent in the race. The vacancies drew a large crowd of contenders; including Tarrant, Barbara Robinson and Frank M. Conaway, Jr., who all finished ahead of Goodwin.

He also served as the House  from 2019 and 2023.\n\n\nLuedtke was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland, attending Thomas S. Wootton High School in  and later the . He worked as a middle school social studies teacher for  from 2004 to 2015.

He also served on Montgomery County's East County Citizens Advisory Board, advocated on environmental issues with the local , and served as a member of the board of trustees of the Sandy Spring Museum. Following his election, he continued to work as a classroom teacher for a number of years prior to returning to his alma mater, the University of Maryland, first as an adjunct instructor and then as a clinical professor.\n\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Luedtke explored a run against incumbent State Senator . He dropped out of the Senate race, but in early 2010 two seats in the House of Delegates became open when incumbent Delegate  decided to challenge Kramer and Delegate  began a campaign against Congresswoman . Luedtke entered the campaign for one of the district's three seats in the House of Delegates, competing against seven other Democrats in the primary. In the primary election on September 14, 2010, Luedtke finished in third place, behind incumbent Delegate  and political staffer . Democrats swept the general election in the district, winning the three Delegate seats as well as the Senate seat. Luedtke was sworn into the House of Delegates on January 12, 2011.\n\nDuring his first term in the House of Delegates, Luedtke was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax policy, education, election law, and gambling. He participated in debates on a number of major issues in his first year. During the floor debate on the Civil Marriage Protection Act, which would have legalized same-sex marriage in Maryland, Luedtke helped defeat hostile amendments. He also played a role in passage of the , giving undocumented immigrants the right to in state tuition at Maryland Universities. In that debate, he was quoted by the Baltimore Sun as arguing that, \"We are talking about children. They didn't make the decision to cross the border,\" and therefore should not be punished for decisions their parents made. He was among the leaders of the effort led by backbenchers in 2014 that resulted in the partial decriminalization of marijuana possession in the state.\n\nIn January 2013, Luedtke was appointed to chair the Financial Resources Subcommittee, which oversees the lottery, casino gambling, and horse racing. He was also appointed as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Gaming Oversight. He continued to serve as chair of that subcommittee until 2017, when he was appointed to chair the Education Subcommittee, which oversees education policy in the state from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. As Chair of the Education Subcommittee, Luedtke authored a range of legislation related to education policy. In 2017, he led successful efforts to place limits on standardized testing in schools through the Less Testing, More Learning Act. That year, he also authored and led the effort to pass and override a veto on the Protect Our Schools Act, which aimed to force the state to assess the quality of schools using a range of criteria rather than simply test scores, and banned the state from attempting to privatize public schools. In 2019, he coordinated efforts by legislators to apply pressure to the State Department of Education to update their history curriculum to ensure that students are taught about the history of the LGBT and disability rights movements.\n\nIn January 2019, Luedtke was selected to chair the Democratic Caucus in the House of Delegates. Later that spring, following the unexpected passing of long time Speaker , he presided over a contentious caucus meeting convened to choose a new Speaker. That meeting resulted in the selection of a compromise candidate, , who became the first woman and the first black legislator to serve in the role of Speaker in Maryland. Later that year, Speaker Jones then elevated Luedtke to serve as House Majority Leader.\n\nLuedtke has advocated in the legislature on a broad range of issues, most notably education, the environment, and for the rights of people with disabilities. During the 2012 legislative session, he argued during floor debate for passage of a bill increasing Maryland's minimum legal age for dropping out of school. He was the lead sponsor in the House of Delegates of Maryland's successful ban on possession and sale of shark fin, part of an international effort to protect shark populations. In 2019, during debate on legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in Maryland, Luedtke gave a key floor speech in support of the bill. The bill later passed the House of Delegates but failed in the Senate.\n\nOn November 14, 2022, Governor-elect  announced that Luedtke would serve as his chief legislative officer. He resigned from the Maryland House of Delegates on January 2, 2023. Former state's attorney candidate  was appointed by outgoing governor  to succeed Luedtke effective January 11, 2023.\n\nLuedtke was a delegate to the , pledged to .\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Luedtke ran for the House of Delegates after then-Delegates  and  decided to run for higher offices.

All Democratic candidates won in a landslide, with Luedtke placing third.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Luedtke, Kaiser, and Zucker ran for re-election. They faced only a single challenger in the primary, winning by wide margins. In the General Election, the three incumbents beat back a strong challenge from Republican candidates buoyed by the off-year wave election and the election of Republican Governor Larry Hogan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He is  and credits his parents, who are of Indian and Pakistani descent, as the reason he became involved in politics. \"[I am] from a family where they were always having political debates around the house, but then I found out that among all these family members who had all these grand ideas, none of them ever voted. There was a sense that, 'I don't like the way things are, but there's nothing I can do about it.' I thought: I'm going to show these people.\"\n\nAli moved to  in 1991 to attend the . He went on to receive Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Computer Science.\n\n\nAli was not originally a member of the  but changed parties after listening to Representative  (D-Md.). Ali was \"so enamored of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions that he changed his party affiliation from  to Democratic.\" Ali soon became \"the first elected President of the District 39 Democratic Club\". Ali's political activity first gained media attention when he \"was the Legislative District 39 Coordinator for the   in 2003 and early 2004.\" After Dean failed to win the primary, Ali supported the  and  . During that election season, Ali became a full-time campaign volunteer for Rep. , because of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions and his stance on the . During Van Hollen's 2004 reelection campaign, Ali said \"I'm really motivated against this war and have never felt so animated before. I thought, 'What is the most head-turning thing I could possibly do?'\" and he \"bought 500 bumper stickers at a buck apiece and applied more than 400 to the car\". It was noted that the family's other car was kept \"very pristine\" as \"That's the one his wife drives.\" Later that year he was co-chair of the Montgomery County Democratic Spring Ball. Also in 2004, Ali, a member of the Montgomery County Muslim Council, helped plan \"the first Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship\" with \"congregations Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, Adat Shalom in Bethesda, Bethesda Jewish Congregation and Fabrangen Cheder\" to \"clean up a historic  stop in \". Ali hoped the event would \"allow people to start lasting friendships and show the ability of these groups to come together for a common good.\" In 2005, Ali's political activities expanded when he helped form the \"Longdraft Road Coalition\", an organization opposing the expansion of this \"quiet, residential two-lane road to a bustling four-lane byway.\" Ali became \"co-chairman of the 180-person plus group\" whose efforts were largely viewed as successful. In September 2005, Ali also co-organized \"The 2nd annual Montgomery County Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship\". In 2005, Ali was a campaign supporter of , the Democratic candidate for Mayor of , which Choi won.\n\n\nOn October 1, 2005, Ali announced his candidacy for inclusion on the three-person Democratic slate for \"Legislative District 39 which includes Montgomery Village, Washington Grove and parts of Gaithersburg, Derwood, Germantown and North Potomac.\" Members of the Maryland General Assembly have four-year terms.\n\n\nOn January 30, 2006, candidate Ali \"accompanied a Montgomery County Education Association (MCEA) contingent to Annapolis to lobby legislators to improve the state's... teacher pension system.\" By June 2006, MCEA had given Ali its \"much sought-after endorsement\" which \"has always carried considerable weight in the minds of county voters. The Apple Ballot lists the recommended candidates that support public education and 11,000 educators. This ballot is an indication of politicians that support public schools and their employees.\"\n\n\nOn August 12, 2006, Timothy James Truett of Montgomery Village allegedly made a \"call to Ali's office in which he asked if Ali was a  and made derogatory remarks about  to Ali's campaign manager.\" Afterward, Truett drove to \"the cul-de-sac outside Ali's Gaithersburg home, which doubles as his campaign office.\" There, he sat down in a lawn chair near the home \"with a hand-lettered sign bearing a crude denunciation of Islam\" [that said 'Islam Sucks']. Truett \"wore a T-shirt reading 'This mind is an Allah-free zone'.\" Ali went out to look at the man and take pictures but did not speak to him, explaining \"I knew he was there to bait me.\" Ali later recalled \"I felt like he was intimidating and trying to menace me and my family, similar to when people burned crosses in someone's front yard. I think it was the exact same message.\" Ali's wife stepped outside and took pictures of Truett.  An older man approached Truett and offered him some water. Ali then spoke to the older man and the older man went back inside. Ali placed one of his campaign yard signs next to Truett and took a picture.  Truett then got up and left. Ali followed him and got pictures of his license plate. Truett then phoned Ali's office again but was hung up on.  Ali later posted pictures of Truett, Truett's birth date and address on his campaign web site.\n\nBoth Ali and the police agreed that nothing illegal had happened, as he \"was in a common area and not on Ali's property. Police apparently notified Truett later that he could be arrested if he did go onto the candidate's property in the next year.\" Ali told reporters that he is \"100 percent Muslim and 100 percent American.... My faith is my faith... but that's incidental.\" He said \"his candidacy is about such matters as 'roads, the schools' and not his religion.\" Quoting directly, \"the demonstration 'reminds me of the need to build bridges amongst people and among communities.'\"\n\n\nOn September 10, 2006, Ali was endorsed by '''' which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said \"Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.\"  On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern for a position on the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that \"Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters\", while political veteran Gene Counihan said \"As far as I could see, he followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it.\" Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. \"Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. When you talk to real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood.\"\n\nKing won 28 percent of the vote, Barkley fetched 27 percent, Ali came in with 25 percent and Stern took 18 percent, according to unofficial results. About 16,600 District 39 voters went to the polls.\n\nOn November 2, 2006, ''The Washington Post'' endorsed the Democratic slate calling Ali \"a bright newcomer\".\n\n\nAli, King, and Barkley faced  challengers David Nichols, Gary Scott, and Bill Witham in the November 2006 election. The Democratic slate won,\naveraging 22.4% over their challengers, who averaged 10.9% of ballets cast.\n\nAfter his election, Ali told reporters that his \"district is about 40 percent minority... and part of his campaign involved introducing those new immigrants to the political process, registering new voters and showing them how to cast a ballot. 'Bringing new Americans into the process is good for everybody. It's empowering.'\" Ali raised nearly $120,000 for his campaign, mostly from family and his personal funds.\n\nIn its electing both Ali and  (from the 17th District), \" became the first state to send two s to the state legislature\". This occurrence was seen as an indication that  have \"political clout beyond traditional strongholds in  and .\" Ali's election is also seen as evidence of another American minority moving towards civic empowerment by participating in the political process, as \"[h]e is the first Muslim in the Maryland State legislature.\" His election and that of  (D-MN) to the United States Congress are viewed by Michelle Boorstein of the Washington Post as \"part of a concerted march of Muslims into civic and political life\" in reaction to \"worries about  and immigration policy\" that began after .\n\n\nIn CNN's \"Election Night 2006\" coverage on November 7, 2006,  mentioned Ali in a discussion about  (D-MN) and the growth of Muslim political participation in the United States.\nMohammed Babah, president of the Muslim Community Center of Maryland saw Ali's election as important for his community \"This is huge. I believe we have a voice now, a voice that is not of suspicion, a voice that will show the Muslim view. After , Muslims were under the microscope. To elect this man shows the confidence that the country has in the majority of good Muslim people. This is reassuring.\"\n\n'''' reported that since \"Saqib Ali was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates this month, he has been flooded with calls and e-mails from across the country asking: How'd you do it? The calls come from American Muslims like Ali, who, longtime political watchers and Muslim activists in the area say, is the first Muslim elected to a statewide – or district-wide – office in Maryland, Virginia or the District.... [E]ight Muslims ran for office in Maryland this year, significantly more than in previous years, although only Ali won. And initial polling data and anecdotal evidence suggest that significantly more Muslims in Virginia registered and voted this month than in previous elections.\" Ever since his election Ali \"has been busy answering those requests for advice [from other Muslims wanting to get civically involved]. 'What I tell them is, know your community well, work hard and don't be a one-issue candidate. And don't let anyone paint you as \"the Muslim candidate.\"\n\nDelegate Ali joined U.S. Representative  (D-MN), U.S. Rep.  (D-IN), State Rep.  (D-IA), State Senator  (D-NC), and State Rep.  (R-NH) as the only elected Muslim officeholders in the United States as of 2006.\n\n\nAli officially took office on January 10, 2006, among 33 other first-time delegates (and 11 freshmen state senators).  Ali's Democratic Party held 104 of 141 delegate seats and 33 of 47 senate seats, giving it veto-proof margins in the State Legislature.  Ali was assigned to the House Environmental Matters Committee.\n\nAfter taking office, Ali was interviewed by the Associated Press while \"holding his snoozing 8-month-old daughter outside the House chamber\". When asked about the anti-Muslim protester during the campaign, Ali said the protester \"was an exception to his experience on the campaign. 'It was disappointing that that kind of bigotry would still rear its head, but I understand it was an isolated incident. Occasionally people would ask if I was Muslim, but most of the time it was a curiosity, not an obstacle.'\" Ali did not want to be seen as just a novelty because of his religion, he said he'd \"like to work on transportation matters and to pass a bill making it tougher for companies to track information and buying habits of private citizens.\" He wanted his constituents to know he's one of them and said, \"I will represent the Muslims, but more importantly, I will represent all the people. I'm a Muslim, but I'm also a resident.\" In other interviews that asked the same question, Ali replied \"I'm Muslim, and that'll always be the case, but I'm here to push good issues and good policy for all Marylanders.... We're looking for good ideas\", and \"I'm here to push good ideas, not so much to push my faith.\"\n\nRecalling the , the AP noted, \"There was no religious controversy as Ali took the oath of office with his colleagues. Maryland lawmakers do not hold their hands on a religious text while taking office.\"  Also joining Ali in the Maryland House was Majority Leader  (D-Montgomery County), a  who's held office since 1990. Ali will be working in \"the oldest statehouse in the country still in use by lawmakers and [a place] that  once walked the hallways.\"\n\n\nAfter his election as Governor,  (D) renewed his four-year call for the state to use revenue from s to reduce its fiscal problem. Opposition to slot machines was one of the issues that Ali ran on and he repeated this position on Maryland Public Radio, citing his fears of the effects that such a measure would have on families of gambling addicts and calling for the state to close corporate tax loopholes instead. The need to speedily implement slot machine usage in the state was also questioned by  , (D-Anne Arundel County), who \"saw no need to take up the issue this year\".\n\n\n* voted in favor of Clean Indoor Air Act of 2007 (HB359)\n* voted in favor of Public Institutions of Higher Education - Tuition Rates - Exemptions (HB6)\n\n\nIn 2010, Ali challenged incumbent   to represent the same 39th district. He was defeated by 3.47%.\nAli began a campaign for his old seat in the House of Delegates for the 2014 election but ultimately decided to drop out of the race.\n\n\nAli is the co-founder of Freedom2Boycott in Maryland, an organization of Palestinian solidarity activists who opposes  that they believe infringe on their constitutional right to boycott Israel and Israeli settlements. The organization helped defeat anti-BDS bills in the Maryland House from 2014 to 2017, but then Governor  issued an executive order requiring state contractors to pledge that they will not boycott Israel to be eligible for contracts. Ali subsequently sued the state as he thought the order infringed on his constitutional rights. Ali lost the suit as the court upheld the Executive Order.\n\n\nAli, his parents, and his sister are all long-time Montgomery County residents. He has been married since 1999 to his wife Susan whom he met when they were working at a computer networking firm. They originally lived in , but moved to  with their 1-month old daughter Sofia. Upon taking office they relocated to Annapolis.\n\nAli is employed as a Senior Software Engineer by The Mitre Corporation in . He is the only engineer (though he does not have a degree in engineering) among the 188 legislators in the Maryland General Assembly.\n\nOn April 10, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' ran a story about the couple's struggle with a  (HPE) pregnancy, and an on-line chat with them about reaction to the story.\n\nIn October 2021, Ali applied to fill a vacancy in the House of Delegates created by the resignation of . Leaders of the Montgomery County Muslim Council pressured Democratic leaders to appoint him to fill the seat, but the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee ultimately appointed the panel's chair, , to fill the vacancy by a vote of 20–2, with one committee member not voting and Foley abstaining.\n\n\n\nAlthough Ali is running for District 15 Delegate in the 2022 Democratic Party, on July 1, 2022 a consent final protective order was filed in a case involving Ali's wife's allegations that Ali has engaged in domestic abuse.\n\n\n* '''2006 Race for Maryland House of Delegates–39th District'''\n::'''Voters to choose three:'''\n:\n:*\n:\n:*'''2010 Race for Maryland Senate−39th district'''\n}}\n\n\n\n:\n*'''2022 Race for Maryland House of Delegates−15th district'''\n::'''Voters to choose three:'''\n\n\n\n\n tags\n----------------------------------------------------------- -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was named to this committee because his district is home to the . From 2011 to 2015, he served as the committee's ranking Democrat. The position placed Ruppersberger on the elite \"\", the chairs and ranking members of the U.S. House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader, House Speaker and House Minority Leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country's most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.\n\n\nIn September 2019, Ruppersberger was one of nine lawmakers who signed a letter to Agriculture Secretary  urging him to reconsider a proposed rule change that would affect the number of Americans that qualified for SNAP, noting that it would be \"Maryland’s most vulnerable residents, including children, seniors, and people with disabilities, who would suffer the painful consequences of unnecessary and preventable hunger.\"\n\n\nIn 2003, Ruppersberger created the national \"Hero Miles\" program to allow Americans to donate their frequent flyer miles to wounded warriors recovering at military or  medical centers as well as to friends and family visiting them. In 2012, he authored legislation expanding the program to enable Americans to donate their hotel reward points to military families. Both the Hero Miles and Hotels for Heroes programs are administered by Fisher House, a nonprofit organization that opens its homes to military families visiting their injured loved ones at hospitals across the country. He won a  in 2004 for this initiative, becoming the last Marylander to win this award, which was previously awarded to U.S. Representative  (1992), State Senator John Astle (1993), U.S. Senator  (1994), U.S. Representative  (1998) and State Delegate  (1999).\n\n\nRuppersberger is an advocate of municipal finance and tax-exempt municipal bonds. In 2013, he and Representative  secured the signatures of 137 other House members in a letter to congressional leaders asking that they \"reject any proposal to cap or eliminate the deduction on tax-exempt municipal bonds used to finance the vast majority of infrastructure projects in America's communities.\" They circulated a similar letter in 2015 and formed the Municipal Finance Caucus in 2016.\n\n\nRuppersberger and Representative  co-sponsored the , designed to increase intelligence sharing between private cyber security firms and government agencies. More than 60 businesses and trade organizations submitted letters of support, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Time Warner, Verizon and AT&T, IBM and Intel. Despite several amendments to address privacy concerns, some groups, such as the , have criticized the act for lacking civil liberties protections, claiming that it authorizes government surveillance of private communications and allows companies to hand over large amounts of personal information on their clients without a warrant or judicial oversight, thereby creating a cybersecurity loophole in existing privacy laws, such as the Wiretap Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. CISPA passed the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012. It was reintroduced into the House on February 13, 2013, and passed on April 18 by a bipartisan vote of 288–127. Of the 92 Democrats who supported the bill, many of them cited significant privacy improvements over the 2012 version.\n\n\nOn October 19, 2017, at the  manufacturing facility in Maryland, Ruppersberger received the Congressional Biosecurity Champion Award from the , a D.C.-based public-interest organization, for \"his leadership and actions taken in Congress to improve U.S. national security, preparedness and response for  threats.\" He was one of eight members of Congress to receive the award.\n\n\nAfter President  launched an  on Syria in April 2017, Ruppersberger expressed hope that \"Russia and Iran stand by the international community in condemning  use of chemical weapons and cooperate in finding an appropriate way forward\", and said the U.S. needed \"a larger, thoughtful strategy to address the situation in Syria, including the defeat of ISIS.\"\n\nIn October 2019, Ruppersberger said he was concerned \"about the instability now in the entire Middle East, and now we're really helping to make Russia even stronger in the Middle East\", and that American troops were expressing concern and embarrassment over leaving behind the Kurds.\n\n\nIn December 2018, '''' reported that Ruppersberger, \"one of five Democrats who joined the majority of House Republicans to block debate on the , had met with  officials and  representing them on numerous occasions\".\n\nIn February 2019, Ruppersberger voted for 's resolution to direct the removal of U.S. armed forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.\n\n\nRuppersberger announced on January 26, 2024, that he would not run for reelection, thus retiring from the House at the conclusion of the . He stated that it was \"time to pass the torch to a younger generation of leaders and I am looking forward to spending more time with my family\".\n\n\nRuppersberger has voted with President 's stated position 100% of the time in the , according to a '''' analysis.\n\n\n\nBarred from a third term as county executive, Ruppersberger opted to run for Congress in 2002 after 2nd district Congressman  ran for . The  significantly altered the 2nd by shifting most of its share of heavily Republican  to the already Republican-leaning 1st and 6th districts, respectively based on the  and in . In its place, the legislature added a heavily Democratic portion of Baltimore City that had previously been in the 1st district. This turned the 2nd from a swing district into a strongly Democratic district.\n\nBefore running for Congress, Ruppersberger legally changed his name so that his lifelong nickname, \"Dutch,\" could appear on the ballot.\n\nAn August 2011 editorial by '''' called the 2nd district \"curlicue territories strung together by impossibly delicate tendrils of land\" and \"a crazy-quilt confection drawn for the express purpose of ousting the incumbent at the time, Rep.

The rural areas of Marylandlargely Republicanhad long criticized Glendening for what they perceived as zealous environmental regulations; in addition, they believed that he did not give sufficient attention to their needs for infrastructure improvements (bridges, highways, etc.).\n\nOn March 15, 2002, Ehrlich announced his candidacy for the governorship. He attacked Glendening's record, tying his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. , to him. Ehrlich promised, if elected, to increase school funding, balance the budget, and protect the . His running mate was , an African-American and the chair of the .\n\nDuring the election, Townsend was criticized for her choice of running mate; she picked retired  , a novice politician who had switched parties only a few weeks before. The Townsend campaign was also hurt by the unpopularity of Glendening, who had implemented a  proposal that was overturned by Maryland's highest court. Townsend's popularity continued to fall when it was reported that much of her campaign money was given by out-of-state donors; Ehrlich remained on the attack while the lieutenant governor's poll numbers declined.\n\nThough  traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican governor in almost 40 years, Ehrlich won the race (52% of the vote to Townsend's 47%). He was the sixth Republican governor in state history and the first since  left office to take the  in 1969.\n\n\n\nEhrlich said \"fiscal responsibility, education, health, and the environment, public safety, and commerce\" were the \"Five Pillars\" of his administration. He opposed sales and  increases and supported legalization of s to raise revenue.\n\nUnder Ehrlich's tenure, Maryland stayed 0.5% or more below the national unemployment average. The unemployment rate dropped significantly from 4.5% in 2003 to 3.9% in 2006, with an increase of 98,000 private sector jobs, aided by its proximity to the strong labor market associated with the national capital.\n\nEhrlich established a Department of Disabilities within his cabinet for people with disabilities&nbsp;– the first such cabinet-level agency in the nation.\n\nIn 2004, Ehrlich signed the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act: it funds upgrades of water treatment plants to reduce pollution discharge by a surcharge on business and residential water and septic bills. The resulting reduction in pollution into the bay was expected to meet approximately one-third of Maryland's obligations under the 2000 . The Chesapeake Bay Foundation described the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act as the most significant piece of legislation for the Bay in a generation.\n\nEhrlich opposed President 's 2006 approval for a  firm to take control of six U.S. port operations, including those at the . (See ).\n\nIn 2006, Ehrlich signed a law banning police traffic ticket quotas.\n\n\nIn January 2006, Ehrlich vetoed the \"Fair Share Health Care Bill,\" also known as the  Bill, which required businesses with more than 10,000 employees in the state (three of the four companies being Walmart, , and ) to either spend eight percent of payroll on employee health care, or pay that amount to a state health program for the uninsured. The bill was commonly nicknamed after Walmart because it was the only company in Maryland of that size that did not already spend the requisite eight percent. Ehrlich, after consulting with counsel regarding the legal validity of the bill, vetoed the proposed legislation as it would run afoul of federal law. Despite this, and over the pleas of state representatives whose constituents benefited from Walmart's employment and feared a diminished presence in the state, the Democratic legislators of the Maryland Legislature passed the bill over Ehrlich's veto, in part leading to cancellation of the building of a Walmart distribution center in one of Maryland's poorest counties.\n\nCritics of the international discount chain claimed that Wal-Mart's low wages force employees and their dependents to rely on state healthcare assistance. (See ). The bill's supporters claimed that the veto showed Ehrlich, whose official biography describes him as \"unapologetically pro-business,\" had sided with \"big corporate interests rather than Maryland's working families.\" For his part, Ehrlich called the bill the \"first step toward government-run health care\" by \"anti-jobs lawmakers.\" He claimed that it would hurt low and middle-income consumers and was unfair to Wal-Mart and other businesses. On July 7, 2006, the Maryland law was overturned in federal court by U.S. District Judge Frederick Motz, who ruled that the law violated the  (ERISA) of 1974, while also noting that it would \"hurt Wal-Mart by imposing the administrative burden of tracking benefits in Maryland differently than in other states.\"\n\n\n\nGovernor Ehrlich opted to seek a second term and did not face opposition in the Republican primary. On November 7, 2006, Ehrlich was defeated for re-election in the  by Baltimore Mayor , who won 53% to Ehrlich's 46%.  Ehrlich's term as governor expired at noon on January 17, 2007.\n\n\nA month after he left public office, Ehrlich and several aides from his administration opened a Baltimore-area office of North Carolina law firm . His wife Kendel took a consulting job as a director of the BankAnnapolis.\n\nIn March 2007, Ehrlich endorsed former New York Mayor  for the US presidency. He was the Chairman of Giuliani's Mid-Atlantic Campaign Committee.\n\nEhrlich and his wife hosted their own radio show on  Radio every Saturday from 2007 to 2010. Governor Ehrlich has guest lectured at Towson University in Professor 's political persuasion class twice a year since 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 30, Ehrlich announced that he would challenge incumbent Governor Martin O'Malley.\n\nIn June 2010, Ehrlich was endorsed by Terrapin basketball standout and  NBA draft pick . On June 30, 2010, Ehrlich announced that his running mate would be , who had served under Governor Ehrlich as secretary of state, August 2, 2005, to January 17, 2007, and also as deputy secretary of state and chief legal counsel, March 2003 to August 2, 2005. He easily won the Republican primary.\n\nHis former lieutenant governor, then Chairman of the Republican National Committee , traveled to Maryland on his \"Fire Pelosi\" bus tour to endorse Ehrlich. Former Massachusetts Governor  also appeared at a fundraiser to endorse Ehrlich. Former New York City Mayor  campaigned in Maryland with Ehrlich, calling him \"one of the best governors of all-time.\"\n\nIn the general election, Ehrlich lost again to O'Malley 56% to 42%.\n\nIn December 2011, Ehrlich's 2010 campaign manager, Paul E. Schurick, was convicted of four counts of fraud and conspiracy concerning a scheme to suppress the black vote using 112,000 fraudulent s, which discouraged voters from going to the polls. Political consultant Julius Hensen was also convicted on one count.\n\n\nIn October 2011, Ehrlich was named chairman of 's Maryland campaign for .\n\nAfter initially supporting  as a Republican candidate in the , Ehrlich endorsed nominee  in May 2016.\n\n\n in 2017]]\nAs of December 2020, Ehrlich was working as  in the Washington office of , a major corporate law firm, on the governmental advocacy and public policy (lobbying) team.\n\nIn August 2022, the Maryland Republican Party announced that Ehrlich would lead its \"2022 Victory Campaign\" to support the party's nominees in that year's elections, including  and . He spent most of his tenure fundraising for the Maryland Republican Party as a whole. Cox and Peroutka were defeated in a landslide by Democratic nominees  and  in the general election on November 8, 2022.\n\n\n\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Office\n!\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Subject\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Party\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Votes\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Pct\n!\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Opponent\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Party\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Votes\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Pct\n!\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Opponent\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Party\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Votes\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Pct\n|-\n|\n|\n||\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|'''Robert Ehrlich'''\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|125,162\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|63%\n|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|74,275\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|37%\n|\n|colspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|\n||\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|'''Robert Ehrlich'''\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|143,075\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|62%\n|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|88,344\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|38%\n|\n|colspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|\n||\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|'''Robert Ehrlich'''\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|145,711\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|69%\n|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|64,474\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|31%\n|\n|colspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|\n||\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|'''Robert Ehrlich'''\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|178,556\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|69%\n|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|81,591\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|31%\n|\n|colspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|\n||\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|'''Robert Ehrlich'''\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|879,592\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|52%\n|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|813,422\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|48%\n|\n| style=\"background:#ff9;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ff9;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ff9;\"|11,546\n| style=\"background:#ff9;\"|<1%\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n||\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|Robert Ehrlich\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|825,464\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|46%\n|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|''''''\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|942,279\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|53%\n|\n| style=\"background:#9dff9d;\"|Ed Boyd\n| style=\"background:#9dff9d;\"|\n| style=\"background:#9dff9d;\"|15,551\n| style=\"background:#9dff9d;\"|1%\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n||\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|Robert Ehrlich\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|776,319\n| style=\"background:#ffe8e8;\"|42%\n|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|''''''\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|1,044,961\n| style=\"background:#def;\"|56%\n|\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* Ehrlich Personnel Story \n* MD Gubernatorial Candidates List  \n*  (official campaign site, archived from 2002)\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Frosh campaigned on progressive policies including reduced bail for poor defendants and litigating against the Trump Administration.\n\nFrosh and opponent Craig Wolf debated at the  Law School after Frosh declined an invitation to a televised debate. Wolf attacked Frosh for focusing on national issues instead of Maryland crime, particularly . Frosh said he had convicted hundreds of the most dangerous people in Maryland, including drug traffickers and gang members.

In 2006, he introduced a bill that would exempt affordable housing from certain zoning restrictions on commercially zoned land. He later withdrew the bill due to its proximity to the 2006 general election. In June 2012, Ball said he supported a bill to revitalize areas around the  corridor. In May 2014, he supported a bill to limit where new affordable housing could be built and requiring the county's Department of Housing to build affordable housing units in areas with low levels of poverty, which he said would \"encourage a full spectrum\" of housing.

She ran for president of the council in 2003 and finished the Democratic primary with 30% of the vote, but lost to  who earned 54%.\n\nDuring her tenure on city council, Pugh created a  project in which fish sculptures were placed around the city and helped to found the . \n\n\n at the 2016 State of the State Reception]]\nIn 2005,  appointed Pugh to an open seat in the  for the 40th district, where she served from June 21, 2005, to January 10, 2007.

Pugh is also responsible for diversifying the state's $40 billion pension portfolio, having led the passage of Senate Bill 606, which increased black and other minority managed dollars from $300 million to $4.2 billion. She also passed legislation allowing Baltimore City to offer $2,500 in property tax relief to public safety officers who work and own a home in Baltimore City.\n\nIn 2011 while still serving as senator for district 40, Pugh and  (MICA) President Fred Lazarus founded the , the first design school in Maryland to serve middle and high school students. Pugh first ran for mayor in  but lost the primary to  after only receiving 25% of the votes.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Pugh entered the race for  and launched her campaign headquarters in the city. Initially she was an underdog to former mayor . The endorsement of Congressman  in April 2016 significantly boosted her campaigning efforts. Pugh won the Democratic primary, with 37% of the vote to Dixon's 34%. The Democratic primary has long been the real contest in Baltimore, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 10-to-1, so Pugh was overwhelmingly favored in the general election. She won the November 8 general election with 57% of the vote, and resigned as state senator before taking office on December 6, 2016.\n\n\nPugh succeeded Stephanie Rawlings-Blake as Baltimore's 51st mayor. As mayor, she inherited several issues from the Rawlings-Blake administration. Pugh prioritized the  investigation into the  following the , before the . In April 2017, Judge  approved the  signed by Pugh and former acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General , rejecting an objection by new U.S. Attorney General .\n\nAdditional issues the Pugh administration faced included Baltimore's crime levels, vacant housing and revitalization development, and the cancellation of the  and launch of Governor 's  bus system overhaul. Despite supporting it during her campaign, Pugh vetoed a bill to increase Baltimore's minimum wage to $15 per hour over five years, citing concerns about businesses moving out of the city and adverse effects on nonprofits and small businesses. Ricarra Jones, chairwoman of the  Baltimore Coalition, responded to the veto, \"As a state senator, Mayor Pugh was a strong supporter of a livable minimum wage and explicitly promised to sign the Baltimore wage bill as mayor. Today, she has made clear that promises are made to be broken.\"\n\nIn July 2017, Pugh along with other city leaders announced a mandatory one-year sentence for illegal possession of a gun in many parts of Baltimore. The move was seen as an attempt to address the city's soaring violence rate. The Baltimore city council voted to amend the legislation to only apply if it was a person's second offense or if the gun was connected to an already committed crime.\n\nDuring her tenure as mayor, Pugh pursued several policies in trying to reduce opioid deaths in the city.

In March 2019, Pugh agreed to accept $500,000 from the  while serving as a trustee to purchase her ''Healthy Holly''  books to donate to Baltimore schoolchildren. This no-bid payment was controversial because the years of payments coincided with her tenure as head of a health committee in the Maryland State Senate and as mayor of Baltimore. She did not disclose the payments or recuse herself from votes and decisions involving the medical system. Maryland legislative leaders pledged to reform the medical center's practice of giving large contracts to trustees due to the conflict it poses to their decision-making, which includes approving a $4 million salary to the institution's CEO. Pugh received $500,000 from the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) for 100,000 copies of her books. However, the firm printing the publication confirmed it had printed only 60,000 copies.\n\nPugh initially said that the payments from the University of Maryland Medical System were her only book sales, but on April 1, 2019, the ''Baltimore Sun'' reported that  paid more than $100,000 for copies of the book, and a nonprofit called Associated Black Charities paid Pugh's organization nearly $80,000 for copies of the book. Both organizations do business with the city of Baltimore. Associated Black Charities in turn resold some of its copies to other organizations, including CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, another Baltimore insurer. \n\n\nIn April 2019 amid the ongoing scandal, Pugh announced she was taking an indefinite leave of absence to recover from . On April 8, 2019, all members of the  signed a memorandum calling for Pugh to resign as mayor. Pugh maintained that she intended to return to office following her leave of absence. On April 25, 2019, while Pugh was still on her leave of absence, FBI and IRS agents raided six locations, including two houses owned by Pugh, Baltimore City Hall, and a nonprofit organization on whose board Pugh served.\n\nOn May 2, 2019, Pugh resigned as Mayor of Baltimore. On November 20, 2019, she was indicted by a grand jury on&nbsp;11&nbsp;counts of fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy in connection with the ''Healthy Holly'' book transactions. The following day she signed a plea agreement, admitting guilt on four counts of tax evasion and conspiracy.\n\n\nOn February 27, 2020, Pugh was sentenced to three years in prison to be followed by three years of probation. U.S. District Judge  ordered Pugh to pay $412,000 in restitution. Additionally, Pugh will forfeit nearly $670,000, including her Ashburton home and the remaining balance of her campaign account totaling $17,800. Pugh has also agreed that all copies of ''Healthy Holly'' in government custody will be destroyed. She was granted several extensions to delay the start of her prison sentence. On June 26, 2020, Pugh reported to prison at , Alabama.  Pugh was released from prison around the beginning of January 2022 and transferred to a Baltimore .\n\n\nPugh married her husband Phillip in 1973, and they divorced two years later; she has no children. She lives in Baltimore's  neighborhood in the  area of Northwest Baltimore City.\n\nA runner and fitness enthusiast, Pugh has written a series of children's health books called ''Mind Garden: Where Thoughts Grow'' and ''Healthy Holly'', which advocate exercise and healthy eating.

She decided to run for office after learning that her daughter and other students were taking tests not at a desk but while seated on the cafetorium floor of their crowded school. She was elected to the Howard County Council in 1986 and served until 1994, when she won a seat representing Maryland's Legislative District 13 in the Maryland General Assembly.\n\nPendergrass served as Vice Chair of the Health and Government Operations (HGO) Committee from 2007 to 2016, until she was appointed Chair in 2017.

She has served as chair of the Howard County Delegation from 1997-2000, 2005-2006 and 2015-2016.\n\nPendergrass' committee assignments led her to develop an interest and expertise in health insurance issues. Over the course of her legislative career, she has sponsored numerous bills with the goal of making health care accessible and effective for Marylanders, including a 2001 bill to provide affordable prescription drug coverage to seniors. That bill was ultimately incorporated into a comprehensive health bill that became law. In 2007, she was among the first legislators to begin advocating for Electronic Health Records, including sponsoring a law passed in 2008  that allowed for electronic signatures.

In a letter to , the state GOP chairman and later U.S. District Court Judge, Neall said, \"While I have from time to time felt uncomfortable and unwelcome in the Republican Party, (my) feelings have clearly worsened in recent years\" because of the changing nature of the party.\n\nIn 2002, Neall was soundly defeated for re-election by Republican .

Mosby gained national attention following the  in 2015, after which she led a highly publicized investigation and unsuccessful murder prosecution of the police officers who arrested and transported Gray.\n\nMosby was reelected in 2018 but lost her 2022 reelection campaign to , following her January 2022 indictment by a federal grand jury on perjury and mortgage fraud charges. The charges against Mosby stemmed from allegations that she had withdrawn money from a program designed to help people financially affected by the . Mosby denied any wrongdoing, and pled not guilty to the charges, but was convicted on two counts of perjury on November 9, 2023, and on one count of mortgage fraud on February 6, 2024.\n\n\nBorn Marilyn James in Massachusetts, Mosby was raised by her grandparents in the Dorchester section of . Mosby's mother, Linda Thompson, was 17 when Mosby was born. Her mother and father both became police officers; her family traces its association with the police for two generations, as her grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in the state. She attended , an hour away from her home, as a result of , the longest-standing school desegregation program in the country. She served in the Student Government Association, and was co-editor of the school newspaper.\n\nHer interest in practicing law was sparked by the murder of her 17-year-old cousin by another 17-year-old outside of her home. Her cousin was mistakenly identified as a drug dealer and consequently murdered.\n\nIn 2000, when she was a 20-year-old  student, James appeared on the '''' television show as a plaintiff, suing a roommate for damaging her property during summer break. She prevailed in the arbitration, and was awarded $1,700. She graduated '''' from  with a () degree; she earned a  from  in 2005.\n\n\nMosby served as a  and as Assistant State's Attorney for Baltimore from 2005 to 2011. Before that she had held a series of legal s in Boston while in law school.\n\n\nIn 2013, Mosby announced plans to run for State's Attorney for the city of Baltimore. She ran against incumbent Gregg L. Bernstein in the Democratic primary, defeating him with 55 percent of the vote. She faced no Republican opposition in the general election.\n\nMosby won the general election, receiving 94 percent of the vote, defeating Independent Russell A. Neverdon Sr., who staged a . At the time of her election, Mosby was the youngest top prosecutor in a major US city.\n\nMosby was sworn into office on January 8, 2015. Soon after her first term in office had begun, Mosby announced restructuring of her office that was inspired by ideas from prosecutors' offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Deputy State's Attorney Janice Bledsoe was named to oversee the new division of \"criminal intelligence\". Mosby reestablished community liaison positions, which her predecessor had eliminated, to inform residents of developments in cases relevant to their neighborhood. She created the Policy and Legislative Affairs Unit to advocate for legislation to help keep residents safe and prosecute cases efficiently.\n\nMosby pushed unsuccessfully for bills that would have allowed prosecutors to introduce prior accusations against serial s during trial, an issue which she raised during her campaign. In May 2015, she secured the conviction of Nelson Clifford, a sex-offender who was acquitted in four previous sexual assault cases involving a \"\" defense. After the verdict she stated, \"While we were able to secure a guilty verdict in this case, we must still encourage our legislators in Annapolis to bring our predatory sexual assault laws in line with the federal statute\". Clifford was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.\n\nIn January 2019, she announced that her office would no longer prosecute individuals for marijuana possession, regardless of quantity. She added that she would vacate nearly 5,000 marijuana possession convictions. In 2020, amid the , she announced that her office would no longer pursue charges related to drug possession, prostitution, minor traffic violations and other low-level offenses in order to halt the spread of the coronavirus in Baltimore prisons. In March 2021, she said she would make that permanent, as she said that the temporary experiment had not led to more serious crimes.\n\nMosby announced on April 12, 2022, that she would run for re-election to a third term. She was defeated by defense attorney  in the Democratic primary on July 19.\n\n\nMosby campaigned on a promise to target and prosecute violent repeat offenders. Since her administration began in January 2015, she has overseen successful prosecutions of a number of locally highlighted offenders, such as Darryl Anderson, Capone Chase, Nelson Clifford, Mustafa Eraibi, and Cornell Harvey.\n\nShe created the Criminal Strategies Unit, modeled after a similar unit in the  District Attorney's Office, to use community assistance to identify and target violent repeat offenders. The Unit utilizes technology, data-analysis, and intelligence-gathering in combination with close relationships with community organizations to identify trends in crime and works with law enforcement to target those who perpetuate these trends.\n\nIn response to a 2015 spike in violent crime in Baltimore, Mosby and newly appointed interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis announced that prosecutors and police officers would co-locate inside of a 24-hour \"war room\" in which law enforcement would target violent repeat offenders around the clock.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Mosby charged six police officers, who had arrested detainee  prior to his death caused by injuries sustained in police custody, with a variety of crimes including  and . David Jaros, an associate professor at the , was reported as saying that Mosby quite possibly overcharged the officers, while noting this is absolutely typical in criminal cases involving defendants who are not police.\n\nAnonymous police department sources were reported by  as saying the Baltimore police's investigation did not support some of the charges brought against the officers. According to CNN,\n\nMosby has good reason to separate her probe from the police. There is widespread community distrust of the police. And many critics say letting police departments investigate themselves is partly why alleged excessive use of force incidents by officers rarely draw serious punishment.\n\nMosby defended the charges in a statement released through a spokesperson, and condemned the release of information as unethical.\n\nIn a May 4, 2015, interview on '''', Harvard Law Professor  said that he believes Mosby overcharged the officers in an attempt to satisfy protesters and prevent further disturbances. Former Baltimore Prosecutor  wrote an op-ed in '''' in which she described Mosby's charges as reflecting \"either incompetence or an unethical recklessness\". Croyder said that Mosby circumvented normal procedures \"to step into the national limelight\", and that she \"pandered to the public\", creating an expectation of a conviction.\n\nOn May 21, a  indicted the officers on most of the original charges filed by Mosby, with the exception of the charges of illegal imprisonment and , and added charges of  to all the officers involved. In May 2015, Mosby appeared onstage at concert with the musician , after which she was criticized for using the Freddie Gray incident for personal and political gain. ''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that Mosby received $12,000 in free travel to speak at events around the nation after the officers were charged.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the allegation from police that she does not support the police, Mosby called the notion 'absurd', citing her family's history of working in law enforcement. Mosby was criticized for requesting the increased police presence, in the same neighborhood where Gray was arrested, just weeks prior to the incident.\n\nWilliam Porter was the first officer tried; this resulted in a , and the judge declared a  in December 2015. ''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that Porter was within one vote of an  on the most serious charge against him.\n\nThe second trial of officers ended on May 11, 2016, when Officer Edward Nero was acquitted on all charges. His acquittal resulted in increased criticism of Mosby for having moved too quickly in charging the officers.\n\nThe third trial ended on June 23, 2016, and Officer Goodson was acquitted on all counts.  professor  filed a complaint with the Maryland's Attorney Grievance Commission against Mosby, saying she did not have  to charge six officers in the , and also that she repeatedly withheld  from the officers' defense attorneys.\n\nFive of the six police officers charged by Mosby sued her for , defamation, and invasion of privacy. The  blocked the lawsuit on the grounds that Mosby had immunity from such charges in May 2018, and the  denied the officers' appeal in November 2018.\n\n\nMosby started initiatives to engage the Baltimore community, including:\n* Aim to B'More – Begun in the spring of 2015 to provide an alternative to incarceration and a criminal record for first-time, non-violent felony drug offenders. Eligible defendants are granted probation before judgment, and placed on three years of probation. During probation, defendants complete 150 hours of community service, job skills training, and GED testing and/or substance abuse treatment as needed. The Office of the State's Attorney partnered with local employers to secure full-time jobs for program participants following completion of their job skills training. If successful, after three years participants can apply to expunge their records.\n* Junior State's Attorney – Launched in the summer of 2015, the program introduces up to 30 promising middle school students each summer to careers in the criminal justice field.\n* Community Day in Court – In an effort to rebuild trust and faith in the criminal justice system, Mosby began holding quarterly Community Days in Court, bringing the public and law enforcement quarterly together to discuss issues plaguing the city.\n\n\nBesides criticism of her case against the officers charged in Gray's death, Mosby has faced questions for her frequent speaking engagements and private businesses. Though she maintained she did nothing wrong, Mosby asked city Inspector General Isabel Mercedes Cumming to investigate. Cumming found Mosby was out of town for 144 workdays in 2018 and 2019, did not report 15 out-of-town trips to the Board of Estimates and used LLCs she claimed to be dormant as tax write-offs. City Solicitor Jim Shea issued his own assessment, finding that administrative rules are unclear and that Mosby did nothing wrong in regards to her travel.\n\nDays later, it was revealed that lawyers who responded to the inspector general's report on Mosby's behalf were paid by Mosby's campaign, a possible violation of state law.\n\nFlorida land records revealed Mosby bought two homes in Florida weeks before the federal investigation came to light.\n\nIn October 2020, a $45,000 tax lien was filed against the property of Marilyn and Nick Mosby for three years of unpaid federal taxes (2014, 2015, and 2016). Nick Mosby said he has been \"in ongoing conversations with the IRS\" about resolving this issue. That November, he said the issue was \"settled\".\n\n\nIn May 2021, Mosby's office filed a complaint with the  (FCC) against Baltimore television station , which had been critical of Mosby, alleging the station's coverage of her office was \"blatantly slanted, dishonest, misleading, racist, and extremely dangerous\". The complaint also stated that \"We welcome being held accountable, and we support First Amendment freedom of speech.\" WBFF responded that its journalism was in the public interest, and \"While we understand that it's not always popular with the individuals and institutions upon which we are shining a light, we stand by our reporting.\"\n\nFCC commissioner  characterized Mosby's complaint as, \"a chilling and direct attack on free speech and journalistic freedom\".\n\n\n\nOn January 13, 2022, Mosby was indicted by a  on a  charge alleging she falsely claimed -related financial hardship in requesting one-time withdrawals of $40,000 and $50,000 of her deferred compensation funds under the , which describes specific criteria for qualifying withdrawals, such as a reduction of income due to a COVID-related layoff or due to quarantining, whereas she reportedly had continued to draw her full salary throughout the period, and her salary had actually increased. She additionally was accused of making false statements in mortgage applications for her Florida home and condo by failing to disclose her federal tax liabilities. There were four counts in the indictment.\n\nOn February 4, 2022, Mosby pleaded not guilty to the charges. Her trial was scheduled to begin in March 2023, but in January, her defense team of six attorneys, who had taken the case pro bono, were permitted to withdraw from the case after being accused of violating court rules, which resulted in further delay. The lawyers' withdrawals stemmed from the possible criminal contempt charges facing lead defense attorney A. Scott Bolden for his conduct, including cursing on the courthouse steps and releasing secret jury information. Mosby was declared indigent, and a public defender, attorney Maggie Grace, was later assigned to represent her.\n\nMosby's perjury trial resulted in conviction on two counts on November 9, 2023. She faced five years in federal prison on each count at sentencing. On February 6, 2024, Mosby was convicted on one count of making a false statement on a mortgage application in a split verdict, which found her not guilty on a second mortgage fraud charge.\n\nIn February, 2024, Mosby defense counsel filed a motion to acquit, contending that the mortgage fraud did not happen in Maryland and claims the government brought the case in the wrong venue.\n\nDuring her trial, court security officers were found to have made \"inappropriate, derogatory comments\" about Mosby, according to a letter from her attorneys unsealed in February 2024. The letter asked the court to provide information about whether jurors had entered the courthouse that day through the same public security check-in area.\n\nDuring the cross-examination of Nick Mosby, he said his then-wife was unfairly targeted by investigators. The judge admonished Mosby and told the jury the comments are stricken from the record.\n\nMosby faces efforts by the Maryland Bar Counsel to suspend her law license and the confiscation of her Longboat Key property which was the subject of the criminal allegations.\n\nMosby faced up to 40 years of incarceration for her guilty verdict for fraud if appeals are not granted.  On February 16, the judge overseeing the case upheld Marilyn Mosby's mortgage fraud conviction rejecting a defense motion to acquit. Mosby was ordered to surrender her passport ahead of sentencing.  According to media reports, prior to the hearing, supporters arrived by bus and packed the courtroom and prayed as Mosby headed inside.\n\nIn May 2024, ahead of her sentencing, Mosby appeared for an interview on MSNBC's '''', where she declared her innocence and called on President  to  her, asserting that she had been \"politically targeted\" and that the proceedings had broken her psychologically, professionally, spiritually, and financially.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, Mosby was sentenced to 12 months of home confinement, 100 hours of community service and three years of supervised release in connection with her perjury and mortgage fraud conviction.\n\n\nIn 2005 James married , the current president of the . They have two daughters. On July 21, 2023, the Mosbys filed for divorce.\n\n\n\n'''Citations'''\n\n* \n\n\n\n*  on The Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office's official website\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

City Council President Brandon Scott criticized Vignarajah's behavior during the stop, saying \"You get into public service to do good for all, not to get special treatment for yourself\". Baltimore Police Sgt Bill Shiflett said that Vignarajah put the officers in a no-win position, because turning the cameras off is against police department policy, and Vignarajah knew it.\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was elected by his fellow State's Attorneys to be President of the Maryland State's Attorneys' Association (MDSAA) for 2005. During his time as President of the MDSAA, he pushed for stronger legislation to expand prosecution of gangs and increased awareness of growing problems with drugs and gangs in  rural areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 4, 2007, Kratovil announced that he would run for Congress in .  During the February 12 primary, Kratovil defeated fellow  Christopher Robinson, Steve Harper, and Joseph Werner.\n\nKratovil expected to face nine-term Republican incumbent , a leading Republican moderate, in the general election. However, Gilchrest was ousted in the Republican primary by a considerably more conservative Republican,  . This significantly changed the race, as Kratovil was now running for an open seat rather than against a long-term incumbent.\n\nKratovil was initially a heavy underdog due to the district's election history. Although Democrats and Republicans were nearly tied in registration, the district has a strong tinge of  that had given Republicans an advantage for most of the time since the end of . It had been in Republican hands for all but 14 years since 1947, although Kratovil received a significant boost when Gilchrest endorsed him over Harris. In June, the  (DCCC) decided to back Kratovil's campaign financially through their Red to Blue program.  Kratovil, who is considered a moderate, picked up a number of endorsements from local Eastern Shore Republicans as well as Democrats. He also received an endorsement from the , a group of fiscally conservative congressional Democrats.  designated the race as \"No Clear Favorite.\"\n\nThe November election was close, as expected. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting absentee ballots, Kratovil's lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7. Harris finally conceded on November 11.\n\nKratovil's election dramatized the geographic split that characterizes the 1st District. An Eastern Shore resident, Kratovil carried all nine counties on the Shore. However, he lost badly in the district's portion of , including most of Harris' base in Baltimore's more conservative eastern suburbs. He also lost the district's portions of  and  counties on the Western Shore.  The district's voters are split almost evenly between the two regions. Kratovil therefore became only the third Democrat to represent the 1st since 1947, and the first since Gilchrest ousted  in 1990.  carried the district with nearly 60 percent of the vote, which was his best showing in the state.\n\n\n\nHarris announced in May 2009 that he would seek a rematch against Kratovil, citing Kratovil's vote for the  in its final form.\n\nKratovil based his 2010 re-election bid on his independent streak in Washington. He was quoted as saying, \"We can send someone to Washington who is going to continue to be independent and put the interests of the people of his district first, or we can send people that are going to put their own extreme ideological views ahead of the best interests of the people of this district.\" He also pointed to his overall record in Congress as proof. He was ranked as being in the top ten of independent voting records in Congress by CQ Politics in 2009.\n\nA \"\" group called The Concerned Taxpayers of America paid $150,000 for ads attacking Kratovil, and $300,000 for ads attacking  of . Mid-October 2010 quarterly  filings showed that the group was solely funded by $300,000 from Daniel G. Schuster Inc., a concrete firm in , and $200,000 from New York hedge fund executive , the co-head of Renaissance Technologies of . According to  at '''', the group said \"it was formed in September 'to engage citizens from every walk of life and political affiliation' in the fight against 'runaway spending.'\" Its only expenditures were for these ads. Schuster was the top contributor to Harris.\n\nKratovil was defeated, taking 42 percent of the vote to Harris' 54 percent. He is one of only three Democrats since 1992 to win 40 percent or more of the district's vote.\n\n\nKratovil aligned himself with the conservative House . Despite the conservative bent of the 1st, he still supported many Democratic priorities. An analysis conducted by ''The Washington Post'' and others found Kratovil voted with the House Democratic Leadership 85% of the time. Major Democratic priorities Kratovil voted for included:\n\n\n\nAn analysis of major legislation only by ''Congressional Quarterly'' and ''Centerline.org'' concluded Kratovil was one of the most centrist congressmen in the country.  Kratovil voted against the  in both November 2009 and March 2010, citing his district's overwhelming opposition to it  and \"the overall cost, the deficit impact, and the negative impact that the bill's employer mandates could have on job creation.\"\n\n\n* ''''''\n**\n**\n**\n* ''''''\n**\n**\n* ''''''\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late December 2011, Maryland Governor  appointed Kratovil as a judge for the Queen Anne's County District Court.

He is the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party. And he has been upfront about what he views, and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for [President Obama's] failure. He said it. And I compliment him for his honesty, but that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh.\"\n\nIn remarks aired by the  program '''' on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, rather than Limbaugh, was \"the ''de facto'' leader of the Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly.\" On March 2, 2009, Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele was not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking why Steele claimed \"to lead the Republican Party when [he seemed] obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?\" After the show, Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying \"I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was maybe a little bit inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It was one of those things where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not.\" Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh \"is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize.\"\n\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Steele launched the \"Fire Pelosi Bus Tour\", with the goal of \"firing\" Speaker Pelosi from her position as  by re-establishing a Republican majority in the . The tour began on September 15 and lasted six weeks, visiting 48 states in the Continental U.S. and more than 100 cities while covering 14,000 miles. The Tour's purpose was to \"encourage votes for Republicans in districts across the nation\". The stops in individual districts gave Steele, \"known for his bomb-throwing speaking style\", an opportunity to fire up local GOP activists. During the tour, \"Steele urged party unity\" as the Republicans attempted to take over the House of Representatives and end Representative Pelosi's tenure as Speaker of the House.\n\nThe RNC broke fundraising records by raising over $198 million during the 2010 congressional cycle; in November 2010, Republicans won 63 House seats (the biggest pickup since 1938) and retook control of the House.

Steele reiterated his frustration with Trump and his supporters during the COVID-19 pandemic by saying \"I've talked to enough of them over the last few days. I'm exhausted, I'm exasperated. You know, at this point, it's like, save who you can save. Because there's only so much you can do, there's only so much you can say. The fact that we have to literally beg people to wear a mask to save their own dumb ass from getting sick, I'm sorry. To me, it is beyond the imagination... I am just so exhausted with this president.\"\n\n\nIn 2008, Steele said he was  and thought '''' was \"wrongly decided\". In a March 2009 interview with '''', Steele suggested that abortion restrictions should be left to state governments, and stated that he \"absolutely\" believed there was room for a \"pro-choice\" candidate in the GOP.

However, in 2012, Steele said that LGBT couples deserve full privileges and benefits under the law.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with '''', Steele commented on : \"Society should draw lines. What do you need an  for, if you're going hunting? That's overkill. But I don't think that means you go to a total ban for those who want to use guns for  or hunting or things like that. But what's the point of passing gun laws if we're not going to enforce them? If you want to talk about , that's where you need to start. We've got 300 gun laws on the books right now. At the end of the day, it's about how we enforce the law.\"\n\nIn 2009, speaking on , Steele called for the U.S. to \"secure our borders first\", saying, \"you cannot begin to address the concerns of the people who are already here unless and until you have made certain that no more are coming in behind them.\"\n\nDuring his 2006 campaign, Steele said that he only supported  if it did not result in the destruction of the . In February 2006, Steele compared  to  during , remarks for which he later apologized.\n\n\nIn July 2010, video footage of Steele was released in which he stated that the  was \"a war of Obama's choosing. If he's such a student of history has he not understood that, you know, that's the one thing you don't do – is engage in a land war in Afghanistan? Everyone who has tried, over a thousand years of history has failed.\" He also said the war was \"not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in\". However, the war in Afghanistan was initiated by  in October 2001 in retaliation for the  on New York City and Washington D.C.; Barack Obama increased troop levels there.\n\nSteele's comments drew criticism, with neoconservative commentator  calling for Steele's resignation and former  adviser  calling Steele's comment \"boneheaded.\" U.S. Senator  of , the Republican  in the , withdrew his support from Steele, calling Steele's comments \"wildly inaccurate ... there is no excuse for them\" and saying \"I think that Mr. Steele is going to have to assess as to whether he can still lead the Republican Party as chairman of the Republican National Committee.\" Senator  called upon Steele to apologize and Senator  said, \"It was an uninformed, unnecessary, unwise, untimely comment. This is not President Obama's war, this is America's war. We need to stand behind the president.\" Former  's daughter  also called for Steele to resign. However,  , who is known for his generally antiwar stance, in support of Steele said, \"Michael Steele has it right, and Republicans should stick by him.\"\n\nIn contrast to his position on Afghanistan, Steele has been a supporter of the  and President 's war strategy. During his 2006 campaign, Steele opposed setting a timetable for . Steele criticized President Obama on the issue, complaining that he had \"demonized\" the Iraq War.\n\n\n\nSteele is a supporter of the . In a piece co-authored with former Michigan Republican Party Chairman , Steele states that \"the good news is that under a national popular vote, a Republican could probably survive a narrow popular vote loss in Texas or Florida and still win the presidency, because every GOP vote in those states would still count toward a national popular vote majority.\"\n\n\nSteele's book, '''', was released on January 4, 2010; it was published by , . The  reported that, \"Steele focuses much of the book on familiar GOP denunciations of President 's overall policies ('a roadmap to failure'), the $787 billion stimulus bill ('a reckless, wasteful, pork-laden spending spree'), liberal views on man-made global warming ('A threat to life on Earth? Depends on whom you ask') and other issues. To regain the public confidence, Steele says the GOP should, among other things, expose the 'reign of error' inherent in liberal policies, contrast conservative and liberal principles, and highlight the damage caused by Obama's policies while explaining conservative solutions.\"\n\n\nMichael Steele has been awarded honors and awards in recognition of his political career.

Kopp's work as a delegate focused on education and budgets, along with audits, pensions, human services, consumer protection, housing, privacy, and good government. She was one of the first two women ever appointed to the House Appropriations Committee. Over her time as a delegate, Kopp chaired the Joint Committee on Spending Affordability, as well as the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education and Economic Development. She also served on the Capital Budget Subcommittee, Subcommittee on Pensions, and Joint Committee on Budget and Audits, and, at various times, as Deputy Majority Leader and Speaker Pro Tem. During her legislative career, Treasurer Kopp was named by her colleagues as the most effective woman legislator and one of the 10 most effective members of the House.

Kopp said the change in payment, pledged by 2011 legislation, was the wrong choice and would be costly to state workers and taxpayers. The Maryland Senate later chose to cut two-thirds from the pledged amount, adding $100 million to the pension that year, with plans for increased payments in future years.\n\nOn October 18, 2021, she announced her intention to retire as Treasurer.

Don't blow it Baltimore, the Democrats have destroyed your city!\" Klacik was one of the speakers on the first day of the , where she gave a two-minute speech.\n\nAfter Klacik accused Mfume in a Twitter post of avoiding debating her, Mfume responded with a post saying that Klacik lacked familiarity with Baltimore, does not live in the city, and that a widely viewed campaign advertisement of Klacik's had misspelled the city's name.\n\nKlacik lost the election with 28 percent of the vote to Mfume's 71.6 percent. She conceded the race to Mfume. On November 8, Klacik claimed that she had won in-person voting and that she had raised enough donations to investigate alleged \"irregularities.\" According to the results published by the State Board of Elections, Mfume received more votes in in-person early and election-day voting as well as in mail-in and provisional voting.\n\nBy the end of her 2020 House election campaign, Klacik had raised $8.3 million from small donors, most of them not from Maryland.

One of them, Arsenal Media Group, who had contracted with Benny Johnson to script and direct the August 2020 campaign video, received over $500,000.

She is a member of the .\n\nA lawyer and longtime community activist, she defeated eight-term incumbent  in the  and, following his resignation, won a special election on June 17, 2008, to fill the remainder of this term. She was sworn in two days later on June 19, becoming the first  woman to represent Maryland in the United States Congress. Edwards ran for a full term in November 2008, defeating Republican candidate Peter James with 85% of the vote. She ran for U.S. Senate in 2016 in the primary to replace retiring  instead of running for re-election to her Congressional seat but was defeated by   in the Democratic primary. In 2022, Edwards ran for the congressional seat she previously held but lost to  in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn 2013, she sponsored an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would repeal the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in ''''.\n\n\nEdwards was born in . She earned  degrees in  and  from , where she was one of only six  women in the class of 1980. After working for  at the  with the  program, she attended and earned a  in 1989 from the  (now known as the University of New Hampshire School of Law). Edwards worked for  as a clerk in the 1980s, when he served in the .\n\n\nEdwards co-founded and served as the first executive director of the , an advocacy and legal support group for .  She worked to pass the 1994 .\n\nShe later worked with , and then as the executive director of the Center for a New Democracy.  In 2000, she became the executive director of the , taking a leave of absence during her political campaign.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, Edwards, along with several other members of the House of Representatives, introduced the Restoring Education and Learning Act (REAL Act) to bring back s to prisoners.  Edwards' press release outlines numerous advantages to prisoner education, including net benefits to taxpayers who bear the costs of recidivism.\n\nEdwards is a national co-chair of the progressive group Health Care Voter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwards challenged seven-term incumbent  in the 2006 Democratic primary&nbsp;– the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. Edwards focused primarily on Wynn's voting record. Wynn, considered a conservative by African-American Democratic standards, was one of four Congressional Black Caucus members that voted for the 2002 Iraq War resolution. Edwards condemned the war before it started. Wynn eventually began to say he was misled by the Bush Administration and his vote was a mistake. Edwards opposed the , which Wynn voted for. Similarly, Edwards criticized Wynn's vote for the , which eliminated some bankruptcy protections for individuals. Wynn supported the energy bill promoted by Vice President and former  CEO Dick Cheney. Wynn opposed the net neutrality bill of 2006, which Edwards supports.\n\nOn August 16, 2006, before a debate at , an altercation occurred between Wynn's staffers and an Edwards volunteer, leaving the volunteer with a bloody gash to the head. This event brought much media attention to the race.\n\nOn August 30, 2006, '''' endorsed Edwards in the primary race.\n\nThe primary was held on September 12, 2006. Wynn defeated Edwards by 49.7 percent to 46.4 percent, with a margin of 2,725 votes out of more than 82,000 cast. George McDermott, a little-known candidate, took 3.9 percent. The final tally of the primary was unclear for nearly two weeks because of widespread voting problems on new electronic voting machines in Montgomery and Prince George's counties.\n\n\n and , January 2008.]]\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Edwards again challenged Wynn for his seat in the . During the 2008 campaign, Edwards accused Wynn of being out of touch with the community and of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars of corporate money. Wynn counter-attacked Edwards as hypocritical, citing the fact that she served as executive director of the Arca Foundation, an organization that has invested millions of dollars in oil and gas companies.\n\n\n\nIn the February 12, 2008, primary, Edwards defeated the eight-term incumbent in a rout, taking 60% of the vote to Wynn's 35%. The win virtually assured her of victory in the heavily Democratic district in November.\n\nAfter the primary, Wynn announced he would resign effective June 2008. Edwards won the Democratic nomination for the June 17, 2008,  to serve out the last six months of Wynn's term. \n\nAs expected, Edwards easily won the special election, taking 81 percent of the vote over  Peter James and  Thibeaux Lincecum. She took office two days later, giving her a leg-up on seniority over any new congresspersons who were elected in 2008.\n\n\n\nEdwards ran for a full term in November 2008 and was an overwhelming favorite; a Republican has never tallied more than 25 percent of the vote in the 4th district since it assumed its current configuration after the 1990 Census. Indeed, many of the 4th district's residents already thought of her as the district's congresswoman even before the special election. As expected, Edwards easily won a full term with 85 percent of the vote, one of the highest percentages in the nation for a Democrat facing major-party opposition.\n\n\n\nEdwards won against Delegate  in the September 2010 primary, and then defeated Republican Robert Broadus with 83 percent of the vote in the general election.\n\n\n\nEdwards won against George McDermott and Ian Garner in the Democratic primary, and then defeated Republican Faith M. Loudon and Libertarian Scott Soffen with 77 percent of the vote in the general election.\n\n\n\nEdwards won against Warren Christopher in the Democratic primary, and then defeated Republican Nancy Hoyt and Libertarian Arvin Vohra with 70 percent of the vote in the general election.\n\n\n\nAfter 's announcement that he would not be running for re-election to Congress in order to , Edwards announced on January 20, 2022, that she would be running in the  for her old seat,  congressional district. United Democracy Project, a  associated with the , ran nearly $6 million worth of advertising attacking Edwards during the primary election cycle. Her successful opponent, former   , also received almost half of his campaign contributions from donors associated with AIPAC. Edwards was supported by $720,000 from the  PAC, and $550,000 from the . ''The New York Times'' described the race as a \"proxy fight over Israel\".\n\nWhile there was heavy outside spending in the 2022 Democratic primary, Edwards went from a 13-point lead to trailing Ivey by 5 points as of early June, weeks before United Democracy Project began running TV ads on June 17. Edwards received 35 percent of the vote, while Ivey received 52 percent.\n\n\n\n\nOn April 27, 2009, Rep. Donna Edwards was arrested outside the  embassy during a protest against . The Representative and five other U.S. Congressional Representatives were protesting the blocking of aid to victims. They were arrested after ignoring warnings issued by police maintaining a police line to protect the embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe other U.S. lawmakers arrested during the protest were Reps.

She lost the primary election on April 26, 2016. Edwards received 39 percent of the vote, while Van Hollen received 53 percent. Since she had run for the Senate seat, instead of for reelection to her Congressional seat, Edwards left public office when her term expired in January 2017, and was succeeded by former lieutenant governor .\n\n\nEdwards ran for  Executive but lost to  in the Democratic primary, despite benefitting from an outside group that spent nearly $1 million to support Edwards and ran what ''The Washington Post'' editorial board deemed a \"smear campaign\". Edwards received 24 percent of the vote, while Alsobrooks received 62 percent.\n\n\nEdwards lives in .\n\nOn July 7, 2017, she announced that she had been diagnosed with .

Hutchins has graduated from several significant professional schools associated with law enforcement and military professions.

Hutchins founded a scholarship endowment for military veterans who enroll in the law enforcement/public safety academic track at the College of Southern Maryland.\n\n\nAfter serving in the military, Delegate Hutchins was a Maryland State Police trooper. Elected to office three times, he served on the judiciary committee, in addition to the gaming law & regulation, and criminal justice subcommittees, to name a few.\n\nColonel Thomas E. Hutchins was appointed by Governor  January 21, 2015 as Director of the Governor's Office for Homeland Security. Hutchins served as personal advisor to the governor on all homeland security issues from counter terrorism to disasters. In addition he supervised a portfolio of Cabinet agencies including the departments of: State Police, Military, Public Safety and Correctional Services, Veterans Affairs, Information Technology, Institute for Emergency Medical Service System, Emergency Management Agency, and the Office of Crime Control and Prevention. During his tenure Hutchins provided key advice to these cabinet agencies guiding them through the transition and several critical incidents to include the riots in Baltimore City during April 2015.\n\nIn 2003, Delegate Hutchins resigned from the Maryland House of Delegates to accept an appointment as Secretary of Veterans Affairs by Governor .  He served in this position for less than a year when he was appointed as the secretary of the Maryland State Police, also by Governor Erhlich.  He replaced , who resigned after a criminal indictment.  Ed Norris is also the former Baltimore City Chief of Police appointed by then Baltimore Mayor . Hutchins was appointed by Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. as secretary of the Department of Maryland State Police and the superintendent of the Maryland State Police on December 10, 2003.  Hutchins was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Maryland State Police by the Maryland Senate in an unprecedented event when he received confirmation in a unanimous vote of approval on the Senate floor without ever being referred to a committee for review.  He is no stranger to the Maryland State Police, having served in the department more than two decades before his retirement in 1994.  During his career with the State Police, Hutchins served in every bureau of the department and broadened his experience through key assignments outside the department. In the history of the Maryland State Police, he is the fourth trooper to come from the ranks of the department and be appointed superintendent.\n\nSeveral significant highlights of his state police career are his command of the State Police Academy / Training Division, which included outreach and training to several foreign countries. He was also instrumental in the formation and leadership of the Maryland State Police Special Tactical Assault Team Element, training them in urban and rural tactics to counter high threat situations, Air Assault Insertion and Rescue Operations, also participating in numerous operations. \nOne accomplishment in Hutchins' career that is little known arose from his observations and subsequent traffic stop of a suspicious person which turned out to be the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy. According to the FBI this encounter uncovered one of the highest-ranking Soviet KGB agents ever identified in the United States at that time. That agent was ultimately found to be involved with John Walker, the U.S. Navy spy who inflicted significant damage to the U.S. intelligence network and the defense of this nation during the later part of Cold War era.\n\nIn 2007, newly elected Governor Martin O'Malley fired Hutchins and replaced him with Baltimore County Police Chief Terrence B. Sheridan.  O'Malley was criticized by   for removing Hutchins, who was the last appointed cabinet member remaining from the Ehrlich administration and the last member of the cabinet from Southern Maryland.\n\nDuring the period 2007 through 2013, Hutchins provided strategic planning assistance to JTF International a non-governmental organization enhancing law enforcement services in the Provincial Police Department of Cordoba, Argentina. Additionally, he worked as a contractor providing strategic planning and liaison support to the Department of Defense NGB J32 Counterdrug Division.\n\n\nIn 2008 it was revealed that the  had included 53 names of non-violent protesters in several databases that track suspected terrorists, despite the lack of any evidence of crimes being committed. This action was taken under authorization from Hutchins, who at the time was serving as the state police superintendent. \nDuring testimony before the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, in which he voluntarily testified on the record, he stated \"if it happened during my tenure then I am ultimately responsible\";  he apologized for the actions that had been taken by certain members of the department stating that those names should not have been entered into that data base. He further stated on the record, that one of those named did in fact raise concerns for violence due to past actions and statements and went on to say that \"sometimes advocacy groups can have one or more fringe people who have their own agenda\" meaning they attach themselves to the group. Hutchins closed by saying the last thing you want is the Superintendent standing before you after a catastrophe to explain why preventive actions were not taken.\n\n\n*'''2002 Race for Maryland House of Delegates – District 28''' Retrieved on Dec. 7, 2007\n::'''Voters to choose three:'''\n:\n\n*'''1998 Race for Maryland House of Delegates – District 28''' Retrieved on Dec. 7, 2007\n::'''Voters to choose three:'''\n:\n\n*'''1994 Race for Maryland House of Delegates – District 28''' Retrieved on Dec. 7, 2007\n::'''Voters to choose three:'''\n:\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In 1983, Senate President  chose Blount to be the Majority Leader of the Maryland Senate, making him its first African-American majority leader. He held this position until he left office in 2003. In 1987, he became the first Black chairman of a Senate committee – the Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee. His demeanor and stature as an educator and veteran earned him the nickname of \"The Conscience of the Senate\".

Boston was running against Blount in the Democratic primary. At the time of the lawsuit, Blount kept an apartment with no telephone and only a  to sleep on within the district, but lived in , which is located outside of the district in . Blount's attorneys argued in court that Blount qualified to represent the district because of this apartment, relying in part on  's 1984 opinion that listed 20 elements that determined a politician's residence. In August 1998,  Circuit Court Judge Michael E. Loney ruled that Blount lived outside of the district and was ineligible to run in it, removing his name from the ballot; Blount appealed the ruling the day after. In September 1998, the  ruled in favor of Blount, putting him back on the Democratic primary ballot and overturning the lower court ruling. Court of Appeals Judge  wrote in the court's 29-page opinion that while the Court acknowledged that Blount's apartment was not his home, but argued that a \"domicile\" doesn't mean a lawmaker's primary residence. \"The requirement is that one must be domiciled in the district, and domicile is not synonymous with party place of abode.\" The decision would come to be known as the \"Clarence Blount rule\".\n\nIn 2022, Maryland state senator  introduced and passed a bill that would place a  on the ballot to amend the  to overturn the Boston v.

During the 2012 legislative session, Olszewski expressed concerns about the legislation, mainly on how it would impact churches, mosques, and synagogues whose members abhor same-sex marriages, and said that he sought protections beyond simply letting religious institutions bar same-sex marriage ceremonies. On February 16, 2012, Olszewski said he would vote for the Civil Marriage Protection Act, saying it would be a \"disgrace\" to go another year without giving Marylanders \"equal protection\". The bill passed the Maryland House of Delegates on February 18 by a vote of 72–67.\n\nWhile in the House of Delegates, Olszewski received an overall approval rating of 30 percent from the , which opposes abortion.

As comptroller, Franchot supported adding toll lanes on the beltway and I-270, requiring schools to open after Labor Day, and reducing restrictions on craft beer sales in Maryland.\n\nIn an interview with  in July 2018, Franchot announced that he would not endorse his party's nominee for governor, , and will instead remain neutral in the gubernatorial contest. \"I think I'm probably going to remain neutral in that racesimply because it's important for me to get along with whoever is elected,\" Franchot said.

During his tenure on the Board, Franchot worked to advance initiatives that reform the state's procurement process and practices, including the reduction of single-bid contracts and increased participation among minority and women-owned enterprises.\n\n\nFranchot used his seat on the Board of Public Works and his high-profile political position to publicly pressure officials in Baltimore City and Baltimore County to immediately install  units in aging school facilities that lack HVAC systems. He frequently sparred with school system leaders and elected officials from Baltimore County, a jurisdiction that in 2011, had 65 school buildings without air-conditioning. His public spats with County Executive , a fellow Democrat, over this issue has alienated Franchot from members of his own party.\n\nIn January 2016, the Board of Public Works approved the use of state funding for portable air conditioners in Baltimore-area schools and lifted a ban on using state funding to purchase window air-conditioning units for public school classrooms. During the meeting, Franchot faced criticism for comparing the lack of air conditioning in schools to the , saying \"We were all dismissed as a bunch of malcontents. This is our \".\n\nTowards the end of the 2016 legislative session, top legislative leaders, who objected to Franchot's frequent criticism, inserted language in budget bills to prevent the use of state funds for portable air-conditioning units in schools, which aligned with Kamenetz's view. In the same legislative session, lawmakers sought to end a practice  known as \"beg-a-thon\"  where school system leaders appear before the Board of Public Works to request additional school construction funding. Later that year in May, the Board of Public Works voted 2–1 to withhold state funding for school construction in Baltimore and Baltimore County unless local officials installed air conditioning in all classrooms by the start of the next school year. In response, Kamenetz released a plan that accelerated the county's installation timeline by one year. In January 2017, the Board of Public Works voted to restore funding to the jurisdictions.\n\nIn September 2016, Franchot and the president of the Maryland State  chapter, Gerald Stansbury, wrote a letter to the  to investigate the lack of air-conditioning in public schools in Baltimore City and Baltimore County. They wrote that the sweltering conditions in these schools, predominantly in financially depressed communities, amounted to a \"blatant neglect of students' civil rights\".\n\nDuring the 2017 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly adopted a budget that removed Governor Hogan from the process of approving the state's school construction plans and allocate $5 million in funding for air-conditioning projects in city schools. During the 2018 legislative session, top Democratic leaders voted to strip the Board of Public Works of its oversight and management of the state's public school construction program. Despite a veto from Hogan, the legislature overrode the governor along party lines. Delegate , chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee and floor leader for the legislation, directly cited Franchot's outspokenness about the air-conditioning issue as a reason contributing to this decision. The legislation established a task force whose membership is appointed by the governor and the legislative presiding officers to oversee and disburse taxpayer dollars for school construction investments.\n\n\nFranchot campaigned against bringing slot machine gambling to Maryland. As a member of the House of Delegates, he led a successful coalition of lawmakers to oppose the Constitutional amendment to legalize slots. In 2008, Franchot, along with hundreds of others, launched Marylanders United to Stop Slots to encourage a 'no' vote on the referendum. Franchot argued that the high social costs of increased crime, broken families and bankruptcies would outweigh any revenue gains. Franchot's opposition to the slots referendum put him at odds with fellow members of his own party, including Governor Martin O'Malley and Senate President , both of whom were prominent proponents of the slots referendum. The 2008 slots referendum passed by a margin of 59 percent to 41 percent.\n\nIn June 2012, Franchot criticized the General Assembly for holding a special session for a proposal for a new casino at the , which would be the sixth casino in Prince George's County. In a letter to members of the legislature, he encouraged lawmakers to disclose \"all contributions from national gambling interests\" and warned against approving the casino, saying it would \"cannibalize\" the venues and \"jeopardize the viability of state's casino program\". In an interview with the  on gambling expansion in Maryland, Franchot expressed heavy skepticism about the promise of casino revenue being used for educational purposes. \"Any education funding that goes into the Education Trust Fund is subject to being raided by the legislature,\" Franchot said. \"That is what's happened historically; that inevitably is what will happen again.\" He opposed a referendum to legalize  at the state's casinos. The 2012 referendum passed by a narrow margin, 52 percent to 48 percent.\n\nFranchot opposed a 2020 referendum to legalize  in Maryland. The 2020 referendum passed by a wide margin, 67 percent to 33 percent.\n\n\nFranchot opposed a bill that was unanimously passed by the General Assembly during the 2017 legislative session that imposed restrictions on the sale and distribution of craft beer products in the state. In response, Franchot formed a \"Reform on Tap\" task force to study Maryland's beer laws and propose reforms on what he considered to be \"antiquated, dysfunctional, anti-small business, and anti-consumer\". In November 2017, he proposed a legislative package to reform the state's regulations on craft brewers through deregulation. The bill would have removed regulations on take-home and taproom sales and limits on beer production, and would have removed a \"buy-back\" provision that prevented breweries from buying their products from wholesalers to increase the limits on what they're allowed to sell.\n\nIn response to Franchot, Delegates  and  introduced legislation forming a task force to study which agency is best suited to regulate the alcohol industry in Maryland. After a hearing in the House Economic Matters Committee that lasted several hours and featured dozens of brewers, elected officials, and other stakeholders who testified in support of Franchot's bill, the committee voted 17–4 to reject the comptroller's legislation. During the 2019 legislative session, Kramer introduced legislation to strip the comptroller's office of its ability to regulate the alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuels industries, instead moving these responsibilities to a governor-appointed commission. The bill passed and was vetoed by Governor Hogan, but the General Assembly voted to override the veto.\n\n\nOn May 8, 2019, the  Council voted unanimously for a proposal requiring Governor Larry Hogan to undertake further environmental reviews before proceeding with his plan to expand Interstate 270 and the Capital Beltway. On June 5, the State Board of Public Works voted to approve the proposal. Franchot and Hogan voted in favor of the proposal, while  opposed it.\n\nIn August 2021, the Maryland Board of Public Works voted to accept a contract that would allow an international consortium to begin design work on the plan to add privately financed toll lanes to portions of the Beltway and I-270, with Franchot and Hogan voting to approve the plans and Kopp voting against it. A second contract, which set up a one-dollar-a-year lease arrangement over 60 years between the Maryland Department of Transportation and the Maryland Transportation Authority, was also agreed upon. On November 19, 2021, the Maryland Transportation Authority Board voted unanimously to approve toll rates on Interstate 270, with prices depending on whether drivers use EZ-Pass or video tolling, the driver's vehicle and amount of passengers, and if drivers commute during hours where traffic is especially acute.\n\n\n\n, 2022]]\nOn January 22, 2020, Franchot announced his candidacy for  in the , which would be vacated by Larry Hogan (R), who is term-limited, in 2022.

Together, they own two homes: one in ; and a second $800,000 home in . Together, they have two children, Abbe (born 1982) and Nick (born 1985).\n\n\nIn his run for House of Representatives in 1988, Franchot remarked, \"I am a liberal, I am proud to be a Democrat who is in the progressive wing of the party.\" He represented liberal-leaning  in the Maryland House of Delegates and was regarded as one of Maryland's most liberal delegates, but took positions at odds with his district. After Franchot was elected Comptroller, he took a rightward turn on fiscal issues. Former  governor of Maryland  takes note of this shift in his book ''Turn This Car Around'', writing: \"Business groups large and small joined in a historic campaign to repeal the new tax. Surprisingly, newly elected State Comptroller Peter Franchot, one of the legislature's most progressive votes during a twenty-year career in the Maryland House of Delegates, joined the pro-business, anti-tax chorus.\"\n\nFranchot identifies as an \"independent Democrat\", holding  and  views. In December 2014, before Governor-elect  was sworn in, Franchot pledged a bipartisan alliance with the incoming governor, and the two have worked together for various causes on the Maryland Board of Public Works. He has been described by progressive news outlet '''' as being \"closer to Republican Governor Larry Hogan than he is to any elected Democrat.\"\n\n\nIn 1991, Franchot sponsored legislation to provide access to abortion in Maryland while requiring physicians to inform minors' parents when their children seek an abortion. The bill passed and was signed into law by Governor  on February 18, 1991.\n\nAfter the  passed the  in 2019, Franchot called for a boycott of Alabama-based business and proposed divesting state taxpayer from being spent in Alabama. He later backed down from this stance, voting for a foster care contract with Seraaj Family Homes, an Alabama-based child placement services company, in June 2019.\n\nFollowing the leak of a draft majority opinion for the  case '''', Franchot signaled support for codifying reproductive rights into the . In May 2022, Franchot sent a letter to Governor Larry Hogan, asking him to release $3.5 million in funds to train abortion care providers as part of House Bill 937, or the Abortion Care Access Act. Hogan denied the request.\n\n\nFranchot criticized the Hogan administration's use of emergency contracts to pay for the state's COVID response efforts. He criticized the governor's purchase of 500 thousand s from , expressing concerns about the transparency and accountability in what happened to the tests. In February 2021, he wrote an op-ed to ''Maryland Matters'' criticizing the governor's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn July 1, 2022, Franchot announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\n\nFranchot supports having a post- start for Maryland public schools, launching a \"Let Summer Be Summer\" campaign to move the start of the school year to after Labor Day in 2015. In August 2016, Franchot joined Governor Larry Hogan at a press conference where he signed an executive order requiring all public schools to begin classes after Labor Day. He opposed legislation passed by the Maryland General Assembly in the 2019 legislative session that would give local school boards the choice to start school years earlier than Labor Day.\n\nDuring the campaign, Franchot said that he would support limiting or eliminating  in classrooms. He opposes the , saying that he would rather shift the state's school curriculum to include teacher buy-ins and lessons that offer students \"skill and knowledge about the modern economy\". He also opposed tax reforms to pay for the Blueprint's proposals. He later reversed his opposition to the Blueprint, saying, \"I was a bit of a skeptic because it didn't have any funding applied to it... I will implement what the legislature wants, but I was skeptical about the dollar amounts\".\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Franchot pledged to make Maryland the first  state for carbon emissions by 2030, protecting and cleaning the , and building a statewide . In April 2022, Franchot and seven other gubernatorial candidates signed a pledge with the  to support legislation to transition the state to use 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035 and to remove trash incineration from the state's \"clean energy\" classification in 2023.\n\nFranchot has faced criticism from environmentalists for his support of proposals to widen the Capital Beltway and Interstate 270, and to rebuild the American Legion Bridge, but he defends his stance by arguing that most vehicles on the road will be powered by electricity rather than gasoline by the time the improvements are made to the highways and bridges.\n\n\nIn 1988, Franchot sponsored legislation that restrict the sale and manufacture of handguns. The bill passed and became law on May 23, 1988.\n\n\nFranchot expressed concern over a proposal from Governor  to increase the state's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour by 2017, saying that legislators should consider its potential negative impacts on small business owners. In 2020, Franchot refused to pause the automatic increase in the state's minimum wage during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nFranchot endorsed U.S. senator from Illinois  for  on January 10, 2008. He endorsed former secretary of state  for  on November 17, 2015. Franchot endorsed Senator  for  on February 17, 2020.\n\n\nFranchot supports using a  consisting of an equal amount of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to draw the state's congressional and legislative districts. He also supports splitting the state legislature's 47  in 141 . Franchot supported a 2012 ballot referendum to repeal the state's congressional maps. The measure was rejected 64%–34% in November 2012.\n\n\nFranchot supports the removal of  in Maryland, rallying for the removal the  statue on social media. The Talbot Boys statue, the last Confederate monument on public land in Maryland, was removed in March 2022.\n\nIn December 2012, Franchot said that he would allow s to file taxes jointly.\n\n\nFranchot opposes levying a , saying that it's more important to get a buy-in from fossil fuel companies to develop  technology. Franchot opposed legislation introduced during the 2012 legislative session that would levy a  indexed to .\n\nAfter Governor Hogan signed legislation enacting a 30-day  amid the , Franchot said that \"the hammer\" would fall on gas station owners who refused to lower fuel prices. In April 2022, Franchot wrote in an op-ed to ''Maryland Matters'' encouraging the  to extend the state's 30-day gas tax holiday by an additional 90 days. In May 2022, Governor Hogan wrote to Franchot asking him to suspend the mandated gas tax increase, to which Franchot replied asking Hogan to declare a state of emergency to suspend the gas tax until September. Franchot called for the General Assembly to form a special legislative session to pass legislation giving him the authority to suspend the state's inflation-based gas tax increase, which is scheduled to take effect in July. Legislative leaders rejected Franchot's request, saying that the gas tax hike pause would \"not result in Marylanders seeking a price reduction at the pump\" and would cost the state over $200 million in transportation funding.\n\n\nFranchot supports building the proposed  transit line, but says the state should consider a  instead of \"automatically going with conventional rail or \".\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 217,524\n| percentage = 32.4\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 202,175\n| percentage = 30.1\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 141,586\n| percentage = 21.1\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 26,594\n| percentage = 4.0\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 25,481\n| percentage = 3.8\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 24,882\n| percentage = 3.7\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 13,784\n| percentage = 2.1\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 11,880\n| percentage = 1.8\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 4,276\n| percentage = 0.6\n}}\n\n| party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| votes = 2,978\n| percentage = 0.4\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n*  at the \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He defeated rival Billy Boniface in the Republican primary on July 19, 2022, and later defeated Democratic nominee Blane Miller III in the general election on November 8. Cassilly was sworn in as county executive on December 5.\n\n\nCassilly's first year as county executive was marked by infighting with the Harford County government, including the County Council, which he has described as \"political attacks\" by unnamed political entities in the county.\n\nFollowing his election, Cassilly moved to block newly elected Democratic county councilmember Jacob Bennett from attending the county's inaugural ceremonies, citing a Section 207 of the Harford County Charter, which prevents people with county or state jobs from serving on the county council. In February 2023, Harford County Circuit Court Judge Richard Bernhardt ruled in Cassilly's favor, saying that Bennett could not serve on the county council until he resigned from his position as a middle school science teacher.

The emails were searched after the county  human resources director asked the county Office of Information Technology director to search Penman's email for communications between him and various other officials in county government to determine if there was \"any basis to suspect misuse of county funds\". Penman had earlier accused Cassilly of misappropriating county funds by transferring $7 million from the county's general fund to the Department of Emergency Management. In a statement to '''', Cassilly acknowledged monitoring Penman's emails, but denied any wrongdoing, asserting that county policy allowed for such reviews and attributing his accusations to politics.

Brooks' access to the financial system was restored later in the week.\n\nIn late September 2023, Healey threatened to sue Cassilly after he blocked her access to the email account of a \"key employee who is on emergency family leave\". Cassilly associated the request with the ongoing criminal investigation into Penman's wiretapping allegations and said that she could gain access to the emails if she released a statement denying Cassilly of any wrongdoing in the investigation. Following the threat of a lawsuit, Cassilly granted Healey with access to new emails sent to the employee.\n\nIn October 2023, Cassilly sought the removal of Penman from the Harford County Council, arguing that him serving as a councilmember and as a deputy sheriff was a violation of the county charter.

In February 2024, Penman field an ethics complaint against Cassilly, alleging that he expedited the approval of a real estate plat submitted on the behalf of his brother, Joseph Cassilly.

In response, Cassilly said that he would not fulfill Gahler's request until the county circuit court ruled on whether the Compliance Board had authority to state whether accessing county servers is illegal.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2017 legislative session, Cassilly voted against a bill that would give the  the ability to sue the .

Cassilly defended these cuts, pointing out that Harford County Public Schools had a $90 million surplus and was due to receive $20 million in funding from the Blueprint.

He signed his budget into law on June 15, 2023.\n\nDuring his 2024 state of the county address, Cassilly said that he would propose a five percent increase to the county's public schools funding; his fiscal year 2025 budget, unveiled in April 2024, did not include any increase in funding for the county's school system, which he blamed on an unexpected drop in income tax revenues. Cassilly further blamed the state's minimum wage increase and tax policies for the revenue drop and refused to increase county taxes to pay for the five percent increase, citing the $99 million held in reserves by the school board, community college, and public library system.\n\nIn October 2024, after the county school system and sheriff's office requested $80 million in additional funding for wage increases, Cassilly posted a video to  telling school officials to \"stop playing politics\" and to \"face to the fiscal reality\", citing two consecutive years of low revenue growth in the county.

He served in the , representing  which covers  and  counties, from January 2007 to January 2023.\n\n\nBeitzel graduated from  in 1964 with a  in biology. He has also received a  in management and a  from .\n\n\nBeitzel served in the  from 1965 to 1968. He was a microbiologist for the  from 1968 to 1971. He was part owner of the Point View Inn & Motel from 1973 to 1978, the Starlite Motel & Restaurant from 1978 to 1983, and the Point View Inn & Motel from 1981 to 2003. When Beitzel Enterprise existed as a company that controlled public accommodation services, he served as President of Beitzel Enterprises, Inc. He served as the Assistant Director of Environmental Health at the Garrett County Health Department from 1971 to 1981.\n\nIn 1981, he assumed the position as administrator for the Garrett County Sanitary District until 1998, he started focusing more on his owned businesses. He has been a farmer since 1983, and was also a Director of Infrastructure Development, D.C. Development LLC, 2003 to 2006. Beitzel served a term as a Garrett County commissioner from 1998 to 2002.\n\nBeitzel became a Maryland State Delegate in 2007 after the 2006 election. He was first appointed to the Health and Government Operations Committee in 2007, but was relocated to the Appropriations Committee in 2009 - where he currently sits as a member. He is part of the Capital Budget Subcommittee, Transportation and the Environment Subcommittee, and the Personnel Oversight Committee - all part of the Appropriations Committee.\n\nIn August 2021, he announced he would not seek a fifth term to the House of Delegates in 2022.\n\nIn October 2021, he was one of five Maryland state legislators from Garrett, Allegany and Washington counties who sent a pair of letters to West Virginia officials asking about annexation of  to West Virginia. These letters caused a local uproar, with Allegany County officials calling the request a political stunt, an embarrassment and unneeded distraction.\n\nFollowing criticism from local officials and some constituents, Delegate  and State Senator  issued a letter withdrawing support for the secession proposal.\n\n\nBeitzel was the subject of criticism in 2011 when he received $427,000 in state funds for agreeing not to develop farm land he owned. The deal actually cost the state of Maryland $455,000, since they also contributed fees for appraisal and other professional services, totaling $28,000.00. The property in question was a farm owned by Wendell and Ruth Beitzel near Accident, Maryland, which they acquired around 2007.\n\nBeitzel submitted an application to the Board of County Commissioners to establish an Agricultural District for a farm they own on Accident-Bittner Road For the purpose of seeking conservation easements utilizes the Maryland Rural Legacy Program. The Beitzel application was approved on February 6, 2008, by the Garrett County Planning Commission and by the Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board on February 28, 2008.  The Board of Garrett County Commissioners approved the application April 29, 2008.\n\nThe Beitzel application was then submitted with 5 others to the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation by the Garrett County Department of Planning and Land Development on April 30, 2008. After approved by the creation of an Agricultural Preservation district by the Garrett County Commissioners, Beitzel submitted an application to participate in the Garrett County Bear Creek Rural Legacy Program to convey development rights to the property in exchange for payment to be determined by appraisal.\n\nThe administration of the program, started by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, ordered three appraisals.  After assessment of the easement, Beitzel was offered $427,000 for the conservation easement on January 12, 2009.  Beitzel accepted the offer on January 28, 2009.  It took several years before the transaction was finally approved by DNR while two other applications were being processed.  After being informed that the application was approved by the DNR for settlement in 2011, Beitzel informed Mr. Williams A Somerville, Ethics Advisor for the Maryland General Assembly Joint Committee and Legislative Ethics of the pending transaction and asked for a review of the easement to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest before and to ensure appropriate disclosure before requesting final approval by the Board of Public Works for Maryland.  In addition, the Delegate submitted Form B&D Disclosure of Interest to the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics.\n\nThe Beitzel application was approved by unanimous vote of the Board of Public Works and the sale of the conservation easement was finalized in 2011.\n\n\nIn March 2014, Beitzel voted against raising the state minimum wage from $7.25/hour to $10.10/hour. The House of Delegates voted 89 to 46 in favor of the legislation. Beitzel spoke out against the wage increase, stating the bill would harm small business owners and cause them to go out of business.\n\n\nIn 2016, Beitzel opposed legislation that would prohibit carrying firearms and deadly weapons on Maryland college campuses. Betizel had concerns that the legislation would impact hunters who might inadvertently travel on university property with a firearm in their vehicle.\n\nBeitzel has sponsored several pieces of legislation related to , a major reservoir in his district, including bills that would allow landowners to purchase contiguous property  and a plan to provide funding for state-owned lakes such as Deep Creek.\n\n\n\nBeitzel said he has been supporting the practice for drilling and as a landowner served to gain from drilling. \"I've been criticized from potentially benefiting financially from  (drilling)\", said Beitzel, who added he would not benefit any more than those who had Marcellus Shale under their property.\n\nIn March 2015 the Maryland Legislature debated a bill, HB449, that would provide for a three-year period to study the health effects of . A panel of experts would study the environmental and public health risks of hydraulic fracturing. Supporting the gas industry's concerns about the bill, Beitzel expressed opposition to the bill and has argued repeatedly that additional studies and regulations would deter gas development in Western Maryland and was not business friendly. Beitzel offered several amendments to the bill which failed on the House floor before a final veto-proof vote in favor of the health study and moratorium. In the end, Beitzel was part of the 103 House members who voted for and helped pass the legislation.\n\nIn a WCBC radio interview posted online on April 9, 2015, Beitzel further explained his opposition to creating the panel of health experts by stating \"The makeup of the panel was created in such a fashion that I felt it was just so slanted to the one side that they would get the results they wanted\". He finally voted for a version of the bill that did not include public health considerations, stating in an interview on WCBC radio about the final bill \"it was not really a bill that was going to cause a whole lot of harm\".\n\nThe fracking issue intensified in the legislature in 2017 when two bills to ban fracking in Maryland were introduced in both the House and Senate.\n\nBeitzel was quoted in '''' as saying \"If you don't have property with natural gas, then you have nothing to gain from it, and it's easier to be opposed to it\". He further suggested that he would not benefit from fracking because \"he does not own the gas rights for his own property, much of which is off-limits to drilling because it is either designated for agricultural preservation or located within one of the watersheds that would be protected under the state's proposed regulations.\"\n\n''The Washington Post'' did a follow-up story on the issue when opposition accused Beitzel of a conflict of interest, which he presented to the Maryland Ethics Council in 2011 to assure the public there was no act of wrongdoing. The question of his conservation easements was raised again, along with his former comments which had led many to conclude that he was not disclosing that he stood to benefit financially if he chose to lease his land for drilling. \"I can only lease that land for agricultural purposes and other uses that are not restricted by the conservation easement,\" he explained the preceding month. Beitzel later provided clarifying remarks and the ''Post'' included a copy of a legislative ethics committee report on the matter.\n\nRegardless of Beitzel's stance on the development of natural gas in Western Maryland, his support has become obsolete since both bodies of the General Assembly passed legislation to ban the process of hydraulic fracturing (House Bill 1325/Senate Bill 740).  support for a ban on hydraulic fracturing and approval to sign the bill into law prevented a proposed moratorium, which would have allowed each county to vote whether or not the residents of that county wanted to ban the practice.\n\n\n\nIn February 2017, Beitzel was recognized by the  for his \"commitment to upholding conservative principles through their voting records during the 2016 legislative session.\"\n\n\n*'''2006 race for Maryland House of Delegates – '''\n::'''Voters to choose one:'''\n:\n\n\nIn January 2023 Garrett College renamed its career technology training center to honor Beitzel in recognition of his efforts towards its creation.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In 1993 he got to serve as a delegate to  and  as part of the American Council of Young Political Leaders. In addition, Schisler is a charter member of the Talbot County Young Republicans club.\n\nOutside of his political activities, Schisler is a member of , an \"international non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of wetlands and associated upland habitats for waterfowl\". He is active member in several environmental groups including the Maryland Ornithological Society, a group that focuses on the protection of birds, and Nature Conservancy.\n\nSchisler is also a member of the , and the  fraternity. He was once a participant in , a leadership action program, which was sponsored by the  of Maryland.\n\nSchisler has earned numerous awards including the  Honor Society, (1987), the Outstanding Academics Award and The Humanitarian Award from  in the 1989-90 school year, and the Outstanding Greek Scholar from , also during the 1989-90 school year.\n\n\nAs a member of the , he was a Minority Whip from 2002 until 2003, Deputy Minority Whip from 1994 until 1997, a member of the Environmental Matters Committee, several subcommittees, and the Joint Committee on Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas from 1992 until 2003.

Finally, he was on the Tri-County Council for the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland from 2001 until 2003.\n\n\n*voted for electric deregulation in 1999 (HB703)\n\n\nFrom 1997 until 1998 he served on the Task Force to Study Retail Electric Competition and the Restructuring of the Electric Utility Industry. This is relevant to the work in his next position, the chair of the  (PSC). Schisler was appointed to the five year position by Governor  in 2003 to succeed .  This appointment was approved by the .\n\nDuring the 2006 gubernatorial election, Schisler came under fire by the Maryland General Assembly and Democratic candidate  for approving a 72% rate hike by utility provider  (BGE).  Schisler's defended his position by stating that the rate hike was the long-term result to the deregulation plan enacted by the Maryland legislature in 1999 during the term of the previous governor, , and approved by the former members of the PSC. One of the members of the PSC that approved the rate cap was Joseph Curran III, the brother-in-law of Baltimore mayor and gubernatorial candidate Martin O'Malley, and son of the , .\n\nThe 1999 plan would allow for competition for electricity in Maryland, but called for a rate cap to last until 2006, which turned out to be a rate so low that it discouraged competition. The original plan also would allow for rates to be reset at the end of the capped period, at which time the market forces would determine the going rate for electricity.\n\nIn the criticism of Schisler, O'Malley stated that the PSC was a \"lapdog for special interests\" and demanded that Schisler be removed from his position.    In a similar vein, , the Speaker of the House for the Maryland House of Delegates, criticized the casual relationship between Schisler and Carville Collins, an industry representative who represented BGE and  Electric. The Democrat's argument was that the Schisler and the rest of the appointees on the commission were too friendly with the industry and not looking out for the interest of the consumers, thus having lost their independence.\n\nIn June 2006, the Democratic-controlled Maryland General Assembly passed a law that included the removal of the current members of the PSC. Ken Schisler sued (''Kenneth D. Schisler, et al. v. State of Maryland'')http://www.courts.state.md.us/opinions/coa/2006/140a05.pdf  and won the right to keep his job arguing that only the governor could fire the members of the PSC.  The law, had it taken effect, would have allowed the General Assembly to appoint 2 members each by the  and  to the PSC, while only allowing the Governor to appoint one member. Currently, the appointment of members of the PSC belongs to the executive branch.\n\nMartin O'Malley won the gubernatorial election in 2006, thus Schisler lost his advocate, Governor Bob Ehrlich. State Senate President  tried to negotiate an amicable deal which would have had Schisler removed, but Schisler turned down the offer. O'Malley's chief council, Ralph S. Tyler, said that if Schisler would not resign his position, he could be fired.  Under pressure, Schisler eventually resigned on February 2, 2007.  Governor Martin O'Malley appointed  to replace Schisler. Larsen is a former Insurance Commissioner for the Maryland Insurance Agency.  Larsen was given a salary of $185,000, 58% more than Schisler's salary of $117,000.\n\nThe PSC approved a 15% increase that would take effect in July 2006 and be in place for 11 months. This was during the final months of Governor Ehrlich's term. A future increase was to be determined after the election. However, Ehrlich was defeated by Martin O'Malley. With the 11-month period nearly over, a 48% rate hike has been proposed, which when calculated along with the original 15%, is nearly identical to the originally proposed 72% rate hike from 2006. Ironically, the new commissioners under Governor O'Malley accepted this proposal stating that there was no legal way to change these new rates.\n\n\n*'''2002 electionfor Maryland House of Delegates – District 37B''' Retrieved on Sept. 30, 2007\n::'''Voters to choose two:'''\n:\n\n*'''1998 election for Maryland House of Delegates – District 37B''' Retrieved on Sept. 30, 2007\n::'''Voters to choose two:'''\n:\n\n*'''1994 election for Maryland House of Delegates – District 37B''' Retrieved on Sept. 30, 2007\n::'''Voters to choose two:'''\n:\n\n*'''1990 election for Maryland House of Delegates – District 37''' Retrieved on Sept. 30, 2007\n::'''Voters to choose three:'''\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

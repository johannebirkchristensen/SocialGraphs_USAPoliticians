He serves on the  committees.\n\n\nCowsert, as Vice Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, became embroiled in a controversial issue during the 2018 legislative session, when ''The Hidden Predator Act of 2018'' (HB 605) was referred to his committee. The intention of HB 605 was to reopen statutes of limitations for victims of child sex abuse, and to allow civil lawsuits to be brought against both the predator and the entities who were allegedly negligent or grossly negligent in their duty of care (i.e., concealment of known predatory behavior by a person). The legislation had previously passed the House with a 170-0 vote. Cowsert, along with other Republican committee members met to draft an amended version of the bill. When the proposed legislation came before his committee, Cowsert supported the Senate version of the bill. The Senate passed the substitute version of HB 605 by a vote of 51-0, and it was sent back to the . The bill's sponsor, , asked the House to insist on the language of the original bill. This insistence came on the final day of the 2018 legislative session and past the deadline for the Senate to hold a vote on reconsideration. The Senate held a vote to waive the Senate rules on reconsideration, but the vote lost in the final hours of the session, effectively killing the bill for 2018.\n\nCowsert's law partner, M. Steven Heath, is currently defending a small church in a current Georgia case of child sex abuse concealment. Cowsert has said he has no personal involvement in the case.

He started a move to excise a dump from the edge of the community. The  eventually sided with the residents. Paige taught at  from 1980 to 1984 and became the Dean of the College of Education in 1984, where he served until 1994. Paige also established the university's Center for Excellence in Urban Education, a research facility that concentrates on issues related to instruction and management in urban school systems.\n\nAs a trustee and an officer of the Board of Education of the  (HISD) from 1989 to 1994, Paige coauthored the board's 'A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions', a statement of purpose and goals for the school district that called for fundamental reform through decentralization, a focus on instruction, accountability at all levels, and development of a core curriculum. A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions was the catalyst that launched the ongoing, comprehensive restructuring of HISD.  As an HISD trustee, Paige launched a municipal-style, accredited police department at HISD with police officers certified by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Education. Paige's board of education began that effort to provide better school safety, and the HISD police department remains the only school district police department in the country to earn accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.\n\nPaige became the superintendent of schools of HISD in 1994.

He saw to it that HISD paid teachers salaries competitive with those offered by other large Texas school districts. Paige made HISD the first school district in the state to institute performance contracts modeled on those in the private sector, whereby senior staff members' continued employment with HISD is based on their performance. He also introduced teacher incentive pay, which rewards teachers for raising test scores.\n\nWhile he was superintendent, Paige led the district to enter into contracts with private schools to use them to teach some HISD students rather than placing those students into overcrowded public schools. Under Paige HISD contracted with three private schools that were certified by the Texas Education Agency to teach HISD students so their parents did not have to bus them to schools across the city.\n\nMany touted the \"Houston Miracle\" accomplished under Paige where student test scores rose under his leadership.

A member of the , Cusack's district encompasses all precincts in the town of  and Precinct 1 and 2 in the town of .\n\n\nCusack graduated from  in 2003 and the  in 2007 with a B.A. in Political Science. He interned for Congressman  and prior to his election to the House in 2010, worked as an assistant to Braintree Mayor .\n\nIn 2011, Cusack was sworn into the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he is currently in his seventh term.\n\nCusack has served as House Chair for the Joint Committee on Revenue since 2019. He previously served as Chair for the Joint Committee on Marijuana Policy and the Committee on Technology and Intergovernmental Affairs, and Vice Chair for the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy.\n\nAdditionally, Cusack served as a member of the Online Gaming, Fantasy Sports Gaming and Daily Fantasy Sports Commission, having been appointed by then-House Speaker  in 2016. He currently sits on the Tax Expenditure Review Commission.\n\n\nOn November 8, 2016, during the Presidential Election voters of Massachusetts were able to vote on a ballot initiative (Question 4) to legalize adult-use marijuana in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The question passed by a percentage of 53.7% Yes to 46.3% No. An extension was then passed by the legislature and the Governor in order for the legislature to review the current law as it stood. The task was to create a law that maintained the will of the voters, while making sure there were the correct consumer protection, public safety, and economic equality in the industry of marijuana. This task was given to the newly created Joint Committee on Marijuana Policy.\n\nCusack was appointed Chairman for the Joint Committee on Marijuana Policy by Speaker  at the beginning of the 190th Session of the Massachusetts General Court (2016–18). The committee held five public hearings in a three month period to hear from elected officials, experts in the industry, law enforcement, veterans, concerned constituents, patients, and many other individuals whom testified with information pertaining to legalizing adult-use marijuana. The Committee did not reach a consensus bill between the House of Representatives and Senate, therefore two separate bills were passed in June 2016.  The House bill was \"an act to ensure the public health and safety of patient and consumer access to medical and adult use of marijuana in the Commonwealth\" (House, No. 3776), and the Senate amendment to that bill was Senate No. 2097. A Conference Committee was appointed, whereas Cusack was one of the three members of the House of Representatives, in hopes to come to an agreement on a consensus bill. A consensus bill was signed by all conferees (6-0) in favor to pass and \"An act to safe access to marijuana\" (House No. 3818) was signed by Governor  on July 28, 2017.\n\n\nA special commission on online gaming, fantasy sports gaming and daily fantasy sports was created through the Economic Development Bill signed by Gov. Baker in 2016. This commission has nine commissioners appointed including the two co-chairs. Cusack was the appointment of Speaker  to represent the leadership within the House of Representatives along with the Co-Chair.  The commission's directive entailed a comprehensive study of the regulations surrounding daily fantasy sports and online gaming, which was officially legitimatized by  through the AGO's final regulations in January, 2016. Meetings of the special commission took place throughout 2016-17, totaling eight, where the commissioners listened to testimony from experts in gaming, esports, daily fantasy sports, the attorney general's office, casinos, and other fields relating to online gaming in Massachusetts.\n\nThe special commission met on July 25, 2017, to finalize a report that was to be sent to the legislature for suggestions on how to proceed with online gaming and daily fantasy sports. Some disagreement ensued and the meeting was recessed until July 31, 2017 (the deadline for a report), On July 31, 2017, a final report was given to the commissioners for a vote in order to allow the report to be sent as is to the legislature. In a vote of 5–3 with one commissioner abstaining, the report was sent out of the special commission to the legislature. Cusack dissented to the report for multiple reasons, one of those reasons was defining daily fantasy sports as \"online gaming\". Another was the negative impact that this definition will have on investors for the DFS companies and the ultimate repercussions that will come to Massachusetts in the loss of innovative businesses.\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was the fourth of five children born to William Archibald Carter and Nina Pratt. In 1904, after his father was murdered by a business partner  which the nine-year-old James witnessed  the Carter family moved to . The relocation allowed a supportive uncle to provide guidance to James  who was enrolled into the   where he stayed until the completion of 10th grade. Biographer Grant Hayter-Menzies speculated that the sudden death of his father left James with an approach to life that was both conservative and cautious. In a 1980 address to the , Jimmy Carter stated that his father had continued a trend set by previous generations of the Carter family by not finishing high school.\n\n\nAfter completing 10th grade, Carter worked as a traveling salesman in Texas. He used the profits he made selling  to invest in an  and a laundry in Plains.\n\nIn December 1917, Carter enlisted in the  for service in .  Initially a  in  I, , he advanced through the ranks to  before being selected for  in August 1918.  He completed the course at ,  on November 30, 1918.  Because the  had occurred earlier in the month, the Army was being reduced in size, so Carter received his commission as a  in the .\n\n\nAfter his discharge from the Army, Carter opened a grocery store on Main Street in Plains. Work in the low-margin grocery store business prompted Carter to use deceptive tactics to maximize profit. His daughter Gloria recounted his showing her how to make bottles of milk appear fuller than they were by pouring milk in a certain manner. Factors such as weather conditions and the constantly changing price of agricultural commodities resulted in wide swings in the income produced from Carter's agricultural pursuits.\n\nHis time as a traveling salesman had already instilled within Carter a strong work ethic. Now, as the owner of a small business, he undertook the routine of working from \"sunrise until dark\", \"Monday morning until Saturday afternoon\", before a single evening of partying. Years later, his son remembered that the Saturday night aspects of that routine conflicted with the preferences of his wife.\n\n\n]]\n\nCarter married  on September 27, 1923, in Plains. According to his son Jimmy, Carter was engaged to another woman at the time of first meeting Lillian and had already planned out the wedding before boarding a train and disappearing for three months. After that time, Carter returned and initiated his courtship of Lillian. Lillian reflected that the couple had to adjust to their different interests, the two having differing political views and reading interests. Carter's reading habits consisted of daily and weekly newspapers, farm journals,  ''The Royal Road to Romance'',  stories of , and the complete set of  tales by . Carter signed and ordered the material in a sequence, and his eldest son would retain the collection decades after his death. Biographer Beverly Gherman wrote that Carter differed from his wife and children in not having a \"love of books\" but instead turning to newspapers for reading material. Decades after Carter's death, Lillian reflected on the strength of their relationship: \"I have never ceased being lonely for him, but I've never been lonely for anyone else.\"\n\nBy the time his son Jimmy was four years old, Carter had purchased a new home. When he took the children to see the house, he realized that he had left his key behind. A wooden bar allowed only a small space for the windows to open, too small to allow access for an adult. Carter sent Jimmy through the window to open the door. Many years later, President Carter would recollect that the \"approval of my father for my first useful act has always been one of my most vivid memories.\" Around the time Jimmy was 13, the elder Carter became one of the first directors of the Rural Electrification Program, Jimmy recounting that his father learned the importance of political involvement on both a state and national level.\n\nJimmy later wrote of his father being a strict parent who punished him when he misbehaved, recounting an experience of being whipped by his father after the latter discovered he had taken a penny out of the collection plate at church. The future president wrote that it was the last time he ever stole. Carter would be credited by his eldest son with being the person who most shaped his \"work habits and ambitions\".\n\n\nCarter was a conservative in his political views. However, his son Jimmy recollected that, \"within our family we never thought about trying to define such labels\". Initially having supported , Carter opposed implementation of his  when production control programs instituted under the Roosevelt administration included the slaughtering of hogs and plowing of cotton. That evolved into a broader opposition to Roosevelt, and Carter never voted for him in subsequent elections. According to his eldest son, despite his disillusion with Roosevelt, Carter never abandoned the statewide Democratic Party and voted for its candidates in the remaining elections held during his lifetime. However, his opposition to Roosevelt led to a different approach when it came to national politics. For the , Carter assembled his family to huddle around a radio for several hours, and subsequently voted for the party's nominee, , in the general election. Within Georgia, Carter supported  in his 1932 gubernatorial bid. Carter's eldest son remembered that he \"would take his one-ton farm truck to Gene Talmadge's rallies and barbecues, its flat bed covered with straw and loaded down with our neighbors\".\n\nAfter having served on the  Board of Education, Carter was elected to the  in 1952, as a Democrat. He served briefly, representing Sumter County until his death the following year due to  on July 22, 1953, at the age of 58. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He served as the  from 1955 to 1959, where he supported  and opposed the integration of Georgia schools. After the end of his gubernatorial tenure, he returned to his native Bainbridge and entered the real estate business, helping to found Bainbridge College (later ) in 1970. He served on the college's board of directors and died from  in 1982.\n\n\nGriffin was born in  and graduated from  in 1929. At The Citadel, Griffin was a battalion commander and also played on the baseball team. He taught in  for a short time before moving back to Bainbridge.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1934, Griffin, a lifelong , was elected to the . Two years later, he failed in an attempt to be elected to the . After that, he served in the administration of Governor , rising to the post of executive secretary. He also owned the Bainbridge radio station, , which was established in the late 1940s. The call sign was for '''M'''arvin '''G'''riffin '''R'''adio.\n\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II, Griffin commanded a Georgia National Guard anti-aircraft battery sent to New Guinea. Griffin was a  for most of World War II and was honorably discharged as a  in 1944. The next day, Governor  appointed Griffin  of the , where he served until 1947. During his tenure as adjutant general, Griffin was a  in the Georgia National Guard.\n\n\nGriffin became the first  to win office in a special election, in 1948. The first person elected as Georgia's lieutenant governor was , who took office in January 1947, but also claimed the office of governor after the death of Governor-elect  in December 1946. Griffin was elected to a full term in 1950.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffin was seen as the successor to Governor , and he won the governorship in  before s were required in Georgia. Griffin received a plurality of 36.3 percent of the ballots cast. Melvin E. Thompson, Griffin's predecessor as lieutenant governor, trailed with 25.1 percent.''Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections'', p. 1677 Another primary candidate was the later    As governor, Griffin was a staunch . He spoke out against the '''' decision and pledged to keep Georgia's schools segregated \"come hell or high water.\"\n\n\nIn 1958, Griffin, who was a segregationist and accused of being racist, took advantage of the intense media coverage surrounding the  in , Canada to promote tourism to his state by offering a group of survivors free vacations to . However, to the segregationist governor's chagrin, one of the rescued miners was black, resulting in a public relations nightmare.\n\n\n\nMuch controversy preceded the , where the , including African-American player , were scheduled to meet the . There was controversy over whether Grier should be allowed to play, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Governor Griffin's opposition to integration.Mulé, Marty – . Black Athlete Sports Network, December 28, 2005 Tech president  and coach Dodd met with Governor Marvin Griffin privately who promised to not interfere with the game. However in December 1955, Griffin publicly sent a telegram to his state's  in an attempt to pressure 's president  to pull out. Griffin implored teams from Georgia not to engage in racially integrated events which had black citizens either as participants or as spectators. Van Leer rejected this request, which was not a stand to serve him well in the 1950s. Van Leer was already catching heat for pushing through a vote to allow women in Georgia Tech. Griffin also sent public telegrams to multiple news publications. Van Leer refused to back down during multiple meetings with the board of regents. In one meeting he would threaten to resign as a show of support when summoned by the board of regents.\n\nHe was quoted: Griffin would later request that Van Leer and Georgia Tech's players be punished for student riots, followed up with an investigation request. Another state representative John P Drinkard recommended that all of Georgia Tech's state funding be cut off if they proceed and later Griffin suggested anyone who adhered to the principles of integration should not be admitted to Tech. Van Leer still stuck to his statements and later received a standing ovation from the faculty senate. Two weeks after the game, Van Leer died of a heart attack on January 24, 1956 at the Atlanta Veterans Hospital.\n\nA large contingent from the New Orleans community, as well as many related to Georgia Tech, openly fought to bar either Grier, Pitt, or the Yellow Jacket team from the game. However, students, football players and Georgia Tech's president,  leaders, as well as a large number of the Pitt community, succeeded in ensuring that the game took place.\n\n\nGriffin's term was marred by charges of corruption. Several administration members were found guilty of crimes and Griffin was investigated in 1960 by a , which returned no s.\n\n\nIn 1962, Griffin ran once more for governor but lost in the primary to a moderate candidate, . Griffin received 332,746 votes (39 percent) to Sanders' 494,978 (58.7 percent). Part of the factor in Griffin's defeat was the abolishment of the county unit system, though one study found that Sanders would have won even if the county unit system had still been in place. Thereafter, Griffin largely retired from politics. After his loss, Griffin commented, \"I retired for reasons of health: the voters were sick and tired of me.\"\n\nIn the , Griffin supported Democratic nominee , an Atlanta businessman known for his segregationist views. Maddox's opponent,   , had supported Griffin in the latter's 1962 campaign. As the publisher of the ''Post Searchlight'' in Bainbridge, Griffin at first indicated that he would repay Callaway for the earlier support, but he instead held firm for Maddox. \"I consider Bo Callaway one of my best friends, but I can't go with him in the governor's race,\" Griffin said. Conversely, former Governor , who as  from 1955 to 1959 had frequently quarreled with Governor Griffin, dismissed Maddox as \"a pipsqueak\" and endorsed Callaway.\n\nIn 1968, Griffin was a stand-in candidate for  on 's  ticket. Griffin was thereafter replaced in the second slot by    although Griffin's name stayed on the ballot in 27 states, mostly concentrated in the Midwest.\n\n\nIn 1946, Griffin's 14-year-old daughter, Patricia Ann Griffin, died in the .\n\nAfter the end of his gubernatorial tenure, Griffin returned to his hometown of Bainbridge and went into the real estate business. His first wife died in 1970, and Griffin, who was devastated by her death, remarried to Laura Jane Gibson. Griffin and his second wife both led active lives. He helped to found  in 1970, where classes began in 1973. He was a leading advocate and member of the college's board of directors. He also oversaw and directed the Decatur County  in 1973, at which Georgia governor and future President  was the honored guest. A lifelong smoker, Griffin was diagnosed with lung cancer, the disease which would eventually kill him. He was heartbroken by the death of his second wife who also died from lung cancer. He died on June 13, 1982, less than a week after his wife’s death.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n*  at ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Meehan is a prominent advocate for  and was one of the major sponsors of  (called the \"Shays-Meehan Bill\" in the House and the \"McCain-Feingold Bill\" in the Senate). He has also been noted for his activism on gay rights issues, and was the chief sponsor of the measure repealing the  policy.\n\nMeehan successfully ran for the House in 1992 on a platform of reform, including a commitment to pushing through s for members of the House. As part of that platform, Meehan made a pledge not to serve more than four terms. On the House floor in 1995, he scolded members who might go back on their promise to limit their tenure in office. \"The best test of any politicians' credibility on term limits,\" he said, \"is whether they are willing to put their careers where their mouths are and limit their own service.\" Despite his pledge, Meehan again ran for Congress in the year 2000, exceeding four terms by two and a half times.\n\nOn October 10, 2002, Meehan was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the . In January 2005, nearly three years after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime and as U.S. troops faced an \"increasingly sophisticated insurgency in Iraq,\" Meehan published a Congressional white paper  advocating that Iraqi security responsibilities be transferred to a new democratically elected government and that the U.S. develop an exit strategy to remove troops within 12 months to 18 months. During a discussion panel at the Brookings Institution, Meehan expressed concerns about the Bush administration having \"no endgame in sight.\" He told the panel that \"it's time for Congress to reassert its role in foreign policy and to take the lead in providing an exit strategy in Iraq.\"\n\nMeehan's campaign fund was among the largest campaign accounts of any House member, with $4,829,540 cash on hand reported on October 15, 2005. This is the result of raising more money than he spent in several campaigns since his first in 1992. In 2016, after his first year as president of UMass, Meehan closed his congressional campaign signaling an end to his political career so he could focus his energies on leading the UMass system.\n\nIn the 2004 Congressional race, Meehan raised $3,170,733 and spent $459,977 of that, thus adding $2,710,756 to his cash on hand. His opponent, Tom Tierney raised $30,943 and spent $30,406. Overall, in the 2004 race, incumbents in the House of Representatives on average raised $1,122,505 compared to $192,964 for their challengers.\n\n interned with Meehan while studying at . He went to work for the  and was killed in action at the .\n\nMeehan was mentioned as a possible candidate for the  in 2004, if Massachusetts' junior senator, , had been elected to the presidency.\n\nMeehan worked with former Marine Staff Sgt.  and a bipartisan group of representatives to Capitol Hill to reintroduce the , legislation that would repeal the Pentagon's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding gay service members.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unidentified individual operating through the U.S. House of Representatives' internet connection made several favorable edits as well as removing statements declaring Meehan's original campaign platform that included a promise not to run for more than four terms. Meehan's chief of staff at the time, Matt Vogel, admitted to the press that he oversaw the edits and removal of the section that pointed out Meehan's decision not to step down from office after four terms.\n\n\nOn May 9, 2007, Meehan delivered an official resignation statement to the , Rep.  (D-CA), indicating that he would leave his post on 1 July 2007.\n\nIn response, Gov.  (D-MA) announced a September 4 primary and an October 16  to determine Meehan's successor. The winner was , the widow of , who held the seat from 1974 to 1979 before being elected to the Senate.\n\nMeehan's former chief of staff, , won his former seat, now numbered as the , in 2018.\n\n\nMeehan became the President of the , a position he assumed in July 2015, after serving as Chancellor of the  since September 2007. On May 1, 2015, the University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees unanimously elected Meehan, citing his record of achievement while serving as the Chancellor at UMass Lowell, his record of public service throughout his career, and his ability to communicate and to inspire, as being among the reasons for selecting him as the 27th President of the Massachusetts University System. Meehan is the first former graduate of a UMass school to serve as President of the UMass System.\n\nMeehan was inaugurated at the  on November 12, 2015, where he vowed to fight for the University of Massachusetts, calling it \"the most important institution in Massachusetts in the critical areas of social mobility and economic growth.\"\n\nMeehan made raising money for scholarship funds the centerpiece of his inauguration. With an initial fundraising target of $1 million, the privately funded inauguration far exceeded its goals and generated a record $1.7 million for student scholarships.\n\nIn his first year of presidency, the University's enrollment reached a record 73,744 students, and research expenditures had risen to a high of $629 million. UMass increased its own funding of financial aid by nearly $20 million during Meehan's first year, with spending rising from $236 million to a record $255 million, the highest ever. Additionally, the UMass Foundation, in part based on Meehan's recommendation, voted to divest direct investments in fossil fuels from the university's endowment, making it the first major public university in the nation to take such action.\n\nAs Meehan began his second year as President of the UMass System, he announced the closing of his congressional campaign, directed that funds be transferred to an education foundation, and stipulated that a $1 million scholarship donation be made to his alma mater, UMass Lowell.\n\nDuring his years at UMass Lowell, the institution achieved record growth in enrollment, student retention and funding for research and scholarships.\n\nDuring his tenure as chancellor, UMass Lowell for the first time was named a top-tier national university. It also was the top-ranked public research institution in New England for starting salary, mid-career salary and overall return on investment for graduates according to PayScale.com. Under Meehan's leadership, UMass Lowell opened 10 new buildings over a five-year period, was named to the President's Higher Education Honor Roll for community service and campus engagement  for six years in a row and made a successful transition to NCAA Division I athletics.\n\nMeehan was presented with the  (ACUI) 2014 President of the Year Award at the organization's 100th anniversary celebration and conference. He was honored by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) at the annual District I program in 2012 with the Chief Executive Leadership Award.\n\n\n\n\nOn April 5, 2017,  officials announced that Chancellor  would resign at the end of the academic calendar year on June 30, take a one-year sabbatical, and return as a tenured faculty member. Meehan stated that UMass Boston Deputy Chancellor , appointed the previous month, would serve as interim chancellor \"until [university] finances are stabilized and the university is positioned to attract a world-class chancellor through a global search\", specifically to address the university's 2017 operating budget deficit of $30 million. In response to the appointment of Mills and Motley's resignation announcement, UMass Boston faculty publicly expressed concern that Motley was being  for the university's budget deficit while ors  and ,  , and   called upon Meehan to reject Motley's resignation. On April 8, 2017, at a UMass System Board of Trustees meeting, UMass Boston faculty and students protested decisions by university administration to cut offerings of courses (many required for graduation) in the upcoming summer semester, as well as other programs and to make expense adjustments which reduced the deficit to approximately $6 million or $7 million.\n\nOn July 1, 2017, Barry Mills became interim chancellor. In November 2017, an  Meehan commissioned from  was presented to the System Board of Trustees that found that faulty , a lack of discipline in its budgeting process, and a failure on the part of UMass Boston administration to appreciate the cost of the campus renewal construction projects on the university's  led to the university's $30 million budget deficit, and in the same month, the university  36 employees after laying off about 100  faculty earlier in the year. In April 2018,  and  administrators announced that the former school would acquire the latter's campus in  after the latter college's closure. The acquisition was immediately opposed by UMass Boston faculty and students due to inadequate consultation with the Boston campus faculty, the Boston campus' budget deficit, and that because of the proximity of the Mount Ida campus to the Boston campus, the faculty contended that the new campus would compete with the Boston campus.\n\nIn April 2018, the UMass Boston campus was the sole  campus in the UMass System. In May 2018, following the approval of the sale by the office of  , the UMass Boston Faculty Council passed a  in Meehan and the System Board of Trustees. In the same month, 10 days after three finalists for the UMass Boston Chancellor position were named, on May 21, 2018, all three finalists withdrew from consideration after faculty members questioned the qualifications of the candidates. On June 20, 2018, UMass System Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs  was appointed as the university's interim Chancellor by the System Board of Trustees effective July 1, 2018.\n\nIn May 2019, the  released a  co-authored by former Massachusetts State Representative  (who also served as the ) that reviewed records obtained from the UMass System 's Office (as well as other publicly available documents) that concluded that Chancellor Keith Motley and other UMass Boston administrators were scapegoated for the 2017  $30 million budget deficit and that instead the approval by the System Board of Trustees of an accelerated 5-year capital spending plan in December 2014 without assuring that  would be made available to pay for the plan, as well as an error to a 5-year campus reserve ratio estimate prepared by the UMass Central Budget Office and presented to the System Board of Trustees in April 2016, was the cause of the $26 million in budget reductions implemented by interim Chancellor Barry Mills and that the reductions made at the direction of the UMass Central Office.\n\nAdditionally, the white paper states that KPMG's 2017 audit was not conducted in accordance with  or reported in accordance with  prescribed by the , and that the purchase of Mount Ida College in April 2018 was conducted by a  from the UMass System for $75 million without being included on the previously approved university capital plan at the time the UMass Central Office ordered the budget reductions rather than UMass Amherst purchasing the Mount Ida campus with  to be repaid with  (and in contrast to how the transaction was described in a  issued by Meehan's office). The following month, interim Chancellor Katherine Newman issued a press statement disputing the findings of the white paper.\n\nIn September 2019, the UMass Boston Faculty Staff Union President addressed the System Board of Trustees to protest the potential offering of equivalent programs at the Mount Ida campus that are already offered at the Boston campus. The following December, the UMass Boston Faculty Staff Union President presented the board with a petition from the Boston campus faculty reiterating their concerns about the Mount Ida campus and requesting more input into its planning. On February 10, 2020,  Dean  was unanimously appointed as the new permanent chancellor of the university succeeding Katharine Newman, and Suárez-Orozco assumed the position on August 1, 2020.\n\n\nMeehan is on the Board of Trustees at Natixis Global Asset Management and on the Board of Governors at Lowell General Hospital. Previously, he has served on the Board of Directors at Sage Bank (formerly Lowell Cooperative Bank), Qteros (formerly SunEthanol), D'Youville Foundation, and was a member of the Board of Trustees of Suffolk University.\n\n\nIn 1996, Meehan married Ellen T. Murphy. They had two children together: Daniel Martin and Robert Francis Meehan. The couple divorced in 2016.\n\nIn July 2022, Meehan married Jennifer Maguire Meehan (formerly Jennifer Maguire Hanson), the Director of Philanthropy at Lowell General Hospital.

She served as president of the  from 2020 to 2022, and as a member of the council from the 7th district from 2018 to 2022.

Wu went on to win the general election, and became Janey's successor.\n\nAs acting mayor, Janey dealt with the ongoing . She launched a Vaccine Equity Grant Initiative to increase awareness and access to the  in communities that were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. She announced a municipal  moratorium in August, after the  overturned a federal moratorium that had been in place. She also dealt with the  population in the  area, clearing the area's tent city towards the end of her acting mayoralty. She signed into law an ordinance which restricted the 's use of ,  and s, a measure in the line of which had been ed earlier in the year by Mayor Walsh. She launched  that made the  Route 28 bus  for three-months. This laid groundwork that her successor, Michelle Wu, built upon to launch an expanded fare-free bus service pilot program.\n\nSince May 2022, Janey has served as the  of Economic Mobility Pathways (EMPath), a Boston  which addresses . She has also held ships at  and  and worked as an executive in residence at  since leaving public office.\n\n\nKim Michelle Janey was born on May 16, 1965, in , to  and Phyllis Janey, who divorced when she was young. Her father taught and worked as a school administrator in Boston, and would serve as  of the , , and . The birthplaces of her ancestors include North Carolina on her mother's side, and Guyana, Virginia, Nova Scotia, and Massachusetts on her father's. One grandfather was born in Chelsea in 1915 and a great-grandfather in Medford in 1890. She \"has had family in the city of Boston for six generations\". Her family was well known in the Roxbury neighborhood. Janey has ancestors that escaped to  through the  before settling in Boston in the latter half of the 19th century.\n\nWhen she was eleven years old, Janey attended school in . She, along with other students, was bused from Roxbury to Charlestown as part of Boston's controversial court-mandated  plan. She later attended high school in , under , a program that allowed city students to voluntary commute to nearby suburbs for high school. She gave birth to a daughter at the age of sixteen. While continuing to attend high school, she also held a job in order to pay for expenses related to raising her daughter. Her father ejected her from his home, and she received assistance from the local  EMPath, who allowed her to use their shelter. She was able to graduate high school, and did so with her 18-month-old daughter accompanying her at her graduation ceremony. She also volunteered for 's campaign in the .\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Janey worked to raise her daughter and attended . She entered  but interrupted her studies to care for her ill grandfather after the death of her grandmother. In 1994, she participated in the Ada Comstock Scholars Program designed for students who are older than the traditional age for college students. She eventually graduated from Smith College in 1994. She suffered from housing insecurity. In order to pay for her first apartment, which was located in the  neighborhood, she made use of a  voucher.\n\n\nJaney worked as a community organizer and education advocate for Parents United for Child Care. She joined the Massachusetts Advocates for Children, a , in 2001. At Massachusetts Advocates for Children, she worked for roughly seventeen years as an activist and project director, mainly focusing on eliminating the opportunity and achievement gaps in education for children , children learning , children with , and children living in . During her time there, she was given the position of senior project director.\n\nJaney endorsed 's candidacy in the . In 2015, Janey served on the transition team aiding  in his transition into the position of superintendent of .\n\n\nJaney served on the Boston City Council from 2018 through 2022. She was regarded as a  member of the Boston City Council. She was a district city councilor, representing the council's seventh district. Her district was centered in the Roxbury neighborhood, and also contained parts of , the  and the . She dubbed her district \"ground zero\" for issues in the city such as economic and racial inequalities, an insufficient supply , traffic, and the . Roxbury is one of the city's most impoverished areas. As a member of the council, she focused on social justice issues and matters related to education. She supported changing the method of choosing  members, replacing the current system of mayoral appointment with an elected school committee.\n\n\nJaney was first elected to the  in . In the September Democratic primary she led the field of thirteen candidates with 25% of the votes, and then she faced the other leading candidate, Rufus Faulk, in the general election. She won the election with 55.5 percent of the 8,901 votes cast. When she was sworn in in January 2018, she became the first woman to represent District 7 on the council.\n\nIn July 2018, Janey, along with fellow city councilors  and , introduced legislation that would have removed as-of-right designations for s, thereby requiring a conditional use permit for a chain stores to open and operate in any area designated as a \"neighborhood business district\". In promotion of the proposed legislation, she said, \"While chain stores also play a role in our economy, it is imperative that community members have the opportunity to weigh in on whether to allow them based on the unique circumstances of their neighborhood business district.\"\n\nJaney partnered with fellow councilor Michelle Wu to probe the city's process for awarding municipal contracts, finding that only 1% municipal contracts were going to women and minority-owned vendors. These findings were the impetus for the city to start looking at ways to diversify the recipients of city contracts.\n\nIn November 2019, the City Council passed an ordinance authored by Janey, aiming to increase equity in the legal  industry. The ordinance included the creation of a new oversight board to assess and vote on applications for licenses based on a set criteria. Mayor Walsh signed the ordinance into law later that month. John Jordan of the publication ''Globest'' wrote that the ordinance made the city the, \"first US city to prioritize cannabis industry diversity\". The ordinance changed the way marijuana dispensaries were awarded licenses by the city, establishing an independent board to review applications. Previously, licenses were awarded by the mayor's office.\n\nJaney and fellow councilor Lydia Edwards proposed a . Negotiations with other city councilors reduced this to a 2% tax on properties valued at $2 million or more, a decrease from their original proposal of a 6% tax. In December 2019, the Boston City Council voted to adopt Janey and Edwards' home rule petition requesting that the state permit the city to impose such as tax. Mayor Walsh advanced the home rule petition to the legislature. If the petition had been authorized by the state, revenue raised from the tax (predicted to be in excess of $160 million annually) was to be placed in the city's Neighborhood Housing Trust to build .\n\n\nJaney was reelected in  with over 70% of the votes cast in her district. In her reelection campaign, it attracted attention that she shared a campaign office with both the reelection campaign of  councilor Michelle Wu and the election campaign of at-large council candidate Alejandra St. Guillen. Wu and Janey were regarded to both be progressive members of the Boston City Council. After the election, Janey argued that the results, which delivered what was regarded to be the most diverse membership in the council's history, provided a political mandate for the city government to pursue more ambitious action and to work to better represent the city's population.\n\nIn January 2020, Janey was elected as president of the City Council by her fellow councilors. Janey was the third consecutive female president of the Boston City Council. She was the second black woman to serve in the role, after only her immediate predecessor . Her presidency of the council marked the first time since 's 1980s presidency that a council president hailed from the Roxbury neighborhood.\n\nIn 2021, Janey and fellow councilor Andrea Campbell proposed an ordinance that would have banned employers in Boston from running s on job seekers, arguing that credit checks are most detrimental to  applicants.\n\n\n\n, Governor , and others in March 2021]]\n\nOn January 7, 2021,   selected Boston mayor  as his nominee for . On March 22, 2021, Walsh was confirmed by the ; he resigned as mayor later that day. Janey, as president of the City Council, became the acting , as prescribed by the . She was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as acting mayor of Boston during a vacancy in the office. She held an unofficial  ceremony on March 24, 2021. The historic nature of her being the first woman and first person of color to hold any mayoral-style role in Boston's history caused her ascent to the role of acting mayor to receive national media attention.\n\nJaney referred to herself as being \"mayor\" rather than \"''acting'' mayor\", dubbing herself Boston's \"55th mayor\". but the numbering convention that deemed her predecessor, Marty Walsh, the 54th mayor was based on counting only persons elected to the role, and excluding those who served solely in an unelected acting capacity. The City of Boston's website does not explicitly number mayors.}} However, the Boston  distinguishes between permanent and acting mayors.\n\nJaney, as City Council president, remained acting mayor until the  in November 2021. Janey announced on April 6, 2021, her candidacy in the mayoral election. Per the Boston City Charter, acting mayors, “possess the powers of mayor only in matters not admitting of delay” and “have no power to make permanent appointments.\" In June 2021, amid tensions between her and the city council over budget discussions, the city council granted itself the authority to remove its president by a two-thirds majority vote. Should that action have occurred, the council would have elected a new president who would then have been designated acting mayor. During the time that she filled most of the duties of mayor on an acting basis, the duties of city council president were in turn filled on an acting basis by the council's president , .\n\nIn April 2021, '''' magazine ranked Janey at 32nd on its 2021 \"100 Most Influential Bostonians\" list. They wrote that, despite the limited powers an acting mayor has under the city charter, being poised to serve as acting mayor for a significant period of time (nine-months) meant that, for her, \"even mayor-lite powers are a pretty big deal, all the more so during a pandemic and economic crisis.\" The magazine also opined that \"Janey, though not a household name in the city until very recently, has plenty of experience and savvy to make the most of this opportunity.\"\n\nAfter Wu took office, Janey remained on the City Council until her term as a councilor expired in January 2022.\n\n\nBy mid-February, in anticipation Walsh's confirmation, a mayoral transition was underway. By February 16, Janey had conducted around twenty briefings with key municipal staff members, including cabinet members and heads of departments. She and Walsh regularly talked, and she attended the twice weekly meetings of Walsh held with the leadership of his mayoral administration. In late February, she designated several key individuals that she would appoint as members of her senior leadership team once she assumed the role of acting mayor.

Heading one of these committees was .\n\n\n\n\nJaney took office amid the .\n\nAhead of assuming the position of acting mayor, Janey selected Omar Boukili to serve as her senior advisor on COVID-19 response and strategic initiatives.\n\nIn March, Janey announced the Vaccine Equity Grant Initiative, which she worked to launch with the city's Office of Health and Human Services and Boston Public Health Commission. The program was aimed to increase awareness of and access to the COVID-19 vaccine in communities disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement of this program was her first announcement after becoming acting mayor.\n\nIn April, Janey and Boston's health and human services chief Marty Martinez announced the Boston Public Health Commission's \"Hope\" campaign, a multilingual public awareness campaign aiming to encourage Boston's residents to get vaccinated against .\n\nIn early August, Janey controversially compared requiring proof of vaccination () to slave papers and . She walked back this comparison days later.\n\nOn August 12, Janey announced a mandate that all municipal employees either needed to be vaccinated for COVID-19 or undergo regular COVID-19 tests. In October, she threatened that she might fire municipal employees who did not abide by this mandate.\n\nIn late August, after the  overturned the federal  moratorium, Janey announced a municipal moratorium, which would remain in effect indefinitely until the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission rescinds it. It bans s and s from serving or enforcing evictions on city residents, except in cases which involve, \"serious violations of the terms of the tenancy that impair the health and safety of other building residents or immediately adjacent neighbors.\" At the same time, Janey announced that she would direct the Department of Neighborhood Development to use $5 million of federal pandemic relief funds to create a \" Prevention Fund\" to help homeowners behind on payment to cover their expenses.\n\nDespite calls by her mayoral election opponents Andrea Campbell and Michelle Wu to do so in August, amid rising  infections, Janey opted not to implement a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for entrance to indoor establishments, such as restaurants and gyms.\n\n\n with Congresswoman  and Senator ]]\n]]\n\nIn late March, Janey's administration temporarily shut down the city's \"comfort station\" in the  area (also known as the \"Methadone Mile\"), which is the location of a large  population. The comfort station provided services such as  to the homeless. It reopened with changes in May, but was permanently shut in July, with Janey's office citing safety concerns.\n\nIn May, Janey stated that the city was \"reviewing\" the possible use of  to bring people to , where facilities could be used to provide services to the homeless (such facilities had been closed on the island since the 2014 closure of the bridge to it). By the end of September, she ruled this out as a viable option.\n\nIn September, Janey announced plans to house homeless people from the Mass and Cass area at a  in . However, Revere mayor Brian M. Arrigo spoke in strong opposition to that idea. However, Janey had stood by the plan.\n\nOn October 19, Janey declared homelessness and addiction a public health crisis. She also announced that she planned to remove tents from the Mass and Cass area, and relocate people into s and treatment centers. She signed an executive order creating a \"central coordinating team\" of local and state officials to outline shelter and addiction treatments available in the region for those needing them. Her executive order also included the step of removing tents from Mass and Cass. The city soon after required homeless people to quickly vacate the area. Some advocates have protested her plan to clear the area's tent city. She justified it by citing the lack of hygienic facilities in tents, the sexual assaults and crime in the area, and the four or five s that are reversed each day in the area. Opponents have argued that the dismantling of the tents and other makeshift structures, forcibly if necessary, effectively amounts to a criminalization of homelessness and addiction.\n\n\n]]\n\nIn April, Janey appointed  as the city's environmental chief.\n\nIn late August, Janey announced that she would be moving to withdraw the Downtown Waterfront District Municipal Harbor Plan zoning plan. The plan had been previously approved in 2017. She cited concerns regarding equity and climate resiliency. However, weeks later, Governor  threatened that state officials would reject Janey's withdrawal, unless the city submitted a replacement plan.\n\nOn October 5, Janey signed into law the Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO), an ordinance requiring buildings in the city that are larger than 20,000 square feet to reach  by the year 2050, and setting emissions reporting requirements for such buildings.\n\nDuring Janey's mayoralty, the city began to explore the possibility of creating a climate bank through the Boston Green Ribbon Commission . This would be funded through a grant from the , which is a member of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission.\n\n\n\n\nIn April, Janey named Stephanie Everett to be head of the city's new Office of Police Accountability and Transparency, which was created in accordance with an ordinance that Walsh had signed into law earlier that year.\n\nIn May, Janey signed into law an ordinance which restricted the 's use of ,  and s. Such a measure had been ed earlier in 2021 by Mayor Walsh. Around the same time, she announced that she had directed the city to drop its legal defense of a Boston Police Department promotion exam that had been criticized by opponents as \"racially discriminatory\". She ordered the city to move to reach a settlement in the years-long litigation surrounding the exam. This move followed both pressure from mayoral election opponents and a story in '''' on the lawsuit.\n\nAlso in May, a report from an independent probe was released, finding  Police Commissioner  to have had a pattern of alleged . After this, she attempted to oust White, who had already been suspended by Mayor Walsh months earlier. White took legal action, challenging her authority as acting mayor to fire him. The Superior Court sided with Janey soon after, though White attempted unsuccessfully to appeal the ruling. In June 2021, she formally terminated White's employment.  White later sued for wrongful termination. In 2022, most of the counts he was suing on were thrown out by a judge, though the remaining counts were cleared to proceed.\n \nIn June, the Boston City Council approved Janey's 2022 budget, which included a $399 million police budget. This marked a reduction from the previous year's budget. The budget reduced police overtime from $65 million to $45 million. Her office claimed that their long-term plan would be to add 30 more officers to the police force, claiming that doing so would help to cut down on overtime expenses. While it passed, aspects related to policing did receive vocal criticism from some members of the city council. For instance, Councilor Andrea Campbell argued that it did too little to push police reform. Councilor  argued that it should do more to push a decrease in police overtime spending.\n\nIn early August, Janey announced plans to fund a pilot program that would see  and  personnel respond without the assistance of police to  calls on mental health matters that are not a public safety concern. The plan was established by the city's Mental Health Crisis Response Working Group, as well as the Boston Police Department and the Boston Office of Health and Human Services at her urging.\n\n\n\n\n for s on ]]\n\n\nSoon after becoming acting mayor, Janey advocated for the  to return to its pre-pandemic service levels.\n\nIn March, Janey announced a pilot program that would offer 1,000 workers in five of the city's business districts (, and ,  , , , Three Squares) free  and  passes with up to $60 in credit.\n\nIn June, Janey announced that the city would be funding a $500,000 three-month pilot that would see the MBTA's Route 28 bus be . In 2019, as a city councilor, she and fellow councilor Michelle Wu had previously called for this. The city, in November 2021, announced that its data showed that during the pilot program ridership had increased to an excess of 70,000 in weekly ridership. Pre COVID-pandemic weekly ridership on the route had been 47,000, making the COVID-era pilot program ridership significantly greater despite the general impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transportation rider. The city concluded that, in comparison to ridership trends on comparable routes of the MBTA, the increase in ridership was directly attributable to the pilot program. A later more in-depth 2022 analysis found an overall 38% increase in weekday ridership from 7,500 before the pandemic to 10,200 during the September and October periods during the pilot program. The pilot program laid the groundwork to further fare-free bus service in the city implemented by her successor Michelle Wu. In December 2021, after Wu succeeded Janey, Wu extended the pilot program by two months. Wu later succeeded in launching a two-year program to have the  MBTA Route 23, 28, and 29 buses run fare-free for two years, with this program beginning on March 1, 2022.\n\n\n celebration]]\n event, joined by Senator Ed Markey (left)]]\n\nIn May, Janey signed an ordinance into law which would move the nonpartisan   for the , in which she was a declared candidate, from its originally-scheduled date of September 21, to the date of September 14.\n\nIn June, Janey announced that the total amount an individual first-time homebuyer could receive in assistance from the city would expand significantly to $40,000. She also signed an  awarding city contractors state s.\n\nIn June, two female   members resigned over a scandal involving racially-charged  that they had sent about   residents. Stating that their resignations left a \"void in Latina leadership\" on the Boston School Committee, Janey pledged that she would appoint Latina replacements, a promise she fulfilled the following month.\n\nIn June, Janey signed an ordinance that would allow for there to be a binding  on the ballot in the November 2021 municipal general election as to whether the city charter provision relating to the municipal budget should be amended. Among the changes proposed in the amendment was giving the City Council the powers to  some of the items in a budget put forth by the mayor, amend a mayor's proposed budget both in whole and in part, and override a mayoral veto of a budget by a two-third's vote. These changes provide the City Council with more powering the creation of a budget. Another change in the amendment was creating an Office of Participatory Budgeting, giving the city's residents more power in the creation of city budgets. Weeks later, State Attorney General  cleared the referendum for inclusion on the ballot. The referendum saw the amendment approved by voters, thereby amending the city charter.\n\nIn September, Janey signed into law an ordinance creating a city commission on  men and boys. The Boston City Council had previously approved the creation of such a commission in 2014, but it had been vetoed by Mayor Walsh.\n\nOn October 6, Janey signed an executive order replacing the city's recognition of the second Monday in October as \"\" with a recognition of the day as \"\".\n\nOn October 22, 2021, Janey sent a letter to the  to announce the city's intention to challenge the  results for the city, alleging that the city's population had been undercounted. As mayor, Janey's successor Michelle Wu would subsequently pursue a litigation against the United States Census Bureau on these grounds.\n\n]]\n\nIn September, Janey signed into law an ordinance that amended the city's existing paid child leave law, changing the wording of the existing law from \"stillbirth\" to \"pregnancy loss\", and also extending paid family leave to those welcoming a new family member (such as through surrogacy or ) or acting as a .\n\nDuring Janey's tenure, some city signage was installed that included her name. Many signs in the city have conventionally listed who the mayor was at the time the sign was installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nActing Mayor Janey announced on April 6, 2021, that she would run in the 2021 Boston mayoral election. This was Janey's first citywide race, and only her third-ever campaign for public office.\n\nEarly into her campaign, she was seen as a likely candidate to advance to the general election. Her acting incumbency, and the national media attention it initially received, was perceived as being a strong advantage. During much of the summer, she was seen as gaining ground in the election, and was out-fundraising her opponents. However,  of '''' and Lisa Kashinsky of '''' have suggested that her comments in early August on vaccine passports were damaging to her momentum. By the closing weeks of the nonpartisan  campaign, Michelle Wu was seen as the , with Janey being perceived as competing with Andrea Campbell and Annissa Essaibi George for a second-place finish.\n\nThe video her campaign had released at its launch played-up her acting incumbency, setting a tone for her campaign, which leaned heavily into her acting incumbency. Janey made a deliberate effort to avoid use of the title \"''acting'' mayor\", promoting herself as simply being the \"mayor\" without attaching the qualifier of \"acting\". In late-August, Joe Battenfeld of the '''' characterized her as having run a \"\", emphasizing her acting incumbency through weekly s and playing a visible role in the city's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a post mortem look at Janey's campaign, Joan Vennochi of ''The Boston Globe'' similarly described Janey as having taken a \"Rose Garden strategy\", speculating that she had patterned such an approach after 's similar approach as acting mayor, which won then-acting mayor Menino the . Vennochi argued that, unlike Menino, Janey had been cautious in governing, and, \"didn't define herself or her plans for a future administration\", and had been \"carefully scripted\" in press conferences, outside of her controversial off-hand remarks about vaccine passports. Similarly, shortly ahead of the preliminary election, Ellen Barry of ''The New York Times'' had written that, as acting mayor, Janey had, \"been cautious in her new role, sidestepping hot-button issues that could hurt her in the general election, and remaining largely scripted in public appearances.\" It was noted in a September 1 article in ''The Boston Globe'' that she had been absent at 30 out of 60 candidate events such as forums, town halls, and one-on-one interviews to which all of the major candidates had been invited, while each of the other major candidates had attended nearly all of these events.\n\nIn running for mayor, Janey was faced for the first time with the challenge of campaigning before a city-wide electorate. As a second-term district city councilor, her only two previous election campaigns had been before the much smaller electorate of her city councilor district. In contrast, two of her opponents, Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George, had been elected city-wide in the past as  city councilors. During the election campaign, there was an ultimately-unsuccessful effort by some Janey supporters to coalesce black support around her candidacy and away from the other two black candidates (Andrea Campbell and John Barros). In late August, Janey began airing her first television advertisements.\n\nFor her platform, Janey had outlined what she called the \"HEART Agenda\", with \"HEART\" being an  for housing, education, accountability, recover/resiliency, and transportation. Originally, like all other major candidates with the exception of Michelle Wu, Janey opposed . However, in August, she changed her stance on the issue, and joined Wu in support of rent control. Janey supported having the state allow for the city to have the option of implementing rent control. Janey's platform also called for an equitable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nJaney  the election shortly after midnight on the day after the primary election, when very little of the vote total had been released. When the votes finished being reported, she had placed fourth. Her defeat as the acting incumbent made her the first incumbent of any kind since  to lose a Boston mayoral election. On September 25, she endorsed Michelle Wu for the general election.\n\n\n\n\nOn September 24, Janey met with mayoral general election candidates  and Michelle Wu at the , and the three agreed to November 16 as the tentative date for the expected transition of power for the mayoralty. After Wu won the mayoral election, Janey served as the honorary chair of Wu's mayoral transition team.\n\nWu became mayor on November 16, 2021, with Janey in attendance at the swearing-in ceremony. After Wu took office as mayor, Janey remained a  city councilor until January 2022.\n\n\n\n\n (left) and author  (right) in 2024]]\n\n\nIn late-May 2022, Janey was announced as the next chief executive officer of the Boston Economic Mobility Pathways (EMPath), a  focused on addressing .

Murphy was the Speaker of the  from 1973 until his defeat in the general election of 2002, making him the third longest serving House Speaker of any U.S. state legislature, behind only  of Illinois and  of South Carolina. He was a member of the .\n\n\nMurphy was born in , where his father was a  operator for the railroad. Murphy graduated from  in 1941 and enrolled  in  in . During  Murphy served in the  in the South Pacific. After leaving the Navy Murphy attended the , graduating in 1949. That same year he was elected to the Bremen Board of Education.  He was elected to the  in 1960, serving in both positions simultaneously until 1965 when he left the Board of Education.\n\nFrom 1967 until 1970 Murphy was the House majority leader under Governor . From 1970 to 1973 he was the Speaker pro tem of the House.\n\nIn December 1973, he was elected to the position of Speaker in the House of Representatives following the unexpected death of . He remained Speaker until his  defeat in 2002. Murphy quickly rose to a position of unsurpassed influence in state government. He became so politically powerful during his speakership, that he is largely credited with helping his legislative protégé, , get elected governor in 1982.\n\nDuring his tenure, Murphy was a key figure in Georgia's economic development and throughout statewide politics; and was considered by many to be the best friend Atlanta ever had in the legislature despite his rural residency and upbringing.\n\nIn 2000 political columnist  wrote of Murphy, \"In his 26 years as presiding officer of the House, he has become as powerful and important in the General Assembly as the governor.\" Murphy's brusque manners could be off putting, and often required the more diplomatic intervention of his speaker pro tempore, . U.S. District  observed that ''Tom Murphy was a powerhouse, and he was an administration unto himself. And Connell knew how to be nice to people. Connell knew how to work with people.''\n\n\nFiercely partisan, Murphy described himself as a , or one who would rather vote for a yellow dog than vote for a Republican. U.S. Representative , who served in the state house from 1993 to 2005–the last four years as minority leader–put it bluntly: \"Tom Murphy wasn't fair, he wasn't bipartisan and he didn't light up a room with his smile.\"\n\nIn 1991 and 2001 Murphy presided over the  process which redrew congressional and legislative lines.  The resulting district maps were criticized as pro-Democratic . Murphy acted to redraw the congressional seats of high-profile Republicans  (1991), and  (2001), in what was viewed as typical of his \"hardball\" application of political power. Gingrich, remarked that \"The Speaker, by raising money and gerrymandering, has sincerely dedicated a part of his career to wiping me out.\"\n\nMurphy frequently skated to reelection, but faced increasingly competitive races from the late 1980s onward as Atlanta's suburbs began bleeding into his district.  Indeed, Republican candidates began winning up and down the ballot in the district during this time.  In 2000, he faced his closest race yet against Republican . Murphy only held on by 505 votes, a margin of less than two percentage points.\n\nGerrymandering ultimately proved to be Murphy's downfall. The contorted districts that resulted from the 2001 remap both confused and angered voters, and is believed to have led to Murphy losing his own seat in 2002 in a rematch against Heath.\n\nShortly after the controversial 2001  process, and Murphy's own political defeat, political power shifted in favor of the Republicans, who gained control of both chambers of the Legislature, the Governor's office, and the majority of statewide elected offices. A number of Murphy's lieutenants, including Lauren \"Bubba\" McDonald and  Reapportionment committee Chairman , who was Murphy's  on efforts to  to favor Democrats, left the Democratic Party and joined with their former political rivals when power shifted to the Republicans.\n\n\nMurphy married Agnes Bennett in 1946. She died in 1982. They had four children together.\n\nIn May 2004, Murphy's grandson M. Chad Long, a lobbyist, and four others including former State Representative  and former  player  were indicted on charges that they stole more than $2 million from the Community Mental Health Center of East Central Georgia. In 2005, in , Williams was convicted on 17 counts related to conspiracy, bribery, theft, health care fraud and money laundering, while the others were convicted on fewer counts. Long was found guilty of conspiracy and health-care fraud. All were sentenced to federal prison terms. Williams was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, Camp received a sentence of 37 months, and Long received a shorter sentence. The group, except Long, appealed their convictions, but in March 2007 the appeal was turned down. A three-judge panel of the  said in an unsigned decision that it found no merit to any of the arguments.\n\n\nMurphy suffered a  in 2004, which left him incapacitated. He died at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on December 17, 2007, in Bremen after years of declining health. To honor his service to Georgia, Murphy lay in state at the Georgia State Capitol on December 21, 2007first within the House chambers and then in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\nWhen Murphy died, Georgia Republican U. S. Senator  said, \"Tom Murphy was a giant in Georgia politics, and his legacy is everywhere.  Without Tom Murphy there would be no World Congress Center, or Georgia Dome or MARTA.\"  Isakson went on to say, \"As tough as he was on the outside, he had a soft spot in his heart for children, the poor and the sick.  He was a product of the Depression and it left a lasting impression on him.  In many a speech Speaker Murphy would reflect on the days of his youth and would vow never to let a Georgia child face the conditions he did.\"\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Elected to a fourth term in November 1946, he died before his inauguration, scheduled for January 1947. Only Talmadge and , in the mid-19th century, have been elected four times as .\n\nA member of the , he was known for promoting  and , and for advocating for racism in the .\n\n\nEugene Talmadge was born on September 23, 1884, in , the second of two children to Thomas and Carrie (Roberts) Talmadge. He attended the  and graduated from the  in 1907. While at UGA, he was a member of the  and  fraternity. In 1909, he married Mattie Thurmond Peterson and the couple had three children, including .\n\nIn 1908, the Democratic-dominated legislature passed a constitutional amendment that effectively  most African Americans in Georgia. This institutionalized the Democratic Party's dominance in the state, in a pattern that had been repeated across most of the former Confederate states since 1890, when Mississippi was the first to pass such legislation.\n\nHe started his legal career in  where he also owned a farm. From 1918 to 1920, he started his political career as the solicitor for . He was the county attorney for  between 1920 and 1923.  He joined the  and twice ran for the , losing in 1920 and 1922. \n\nHe was elected as the  in 1926, defeating J. J. Brown. Talmadge was re-elected commissioner in 1928 and 1930. As commissioner, Talmadge used the newspaper of his department to give advice to farmers and promote  his political views, extolling the virtues of a  economic policy and individual action to improve the well-being of farmers. He maintained widespread support among Georgia's rural white communities.\n\nThe  concluded that Talmadge violated a state law requiring that fertilizer fees collected by the agriculture department be deposited in the state treasury.  He was criticized for paying himself and family members more than $40,000 in salaries and expenses, and using department funds to make trips to the .  Accused of \"stealing\" $20,000 in order to raise the price of hogs, Talmadge told one group of farmers, \"Sure, I stole it!  But I stole it for you.\" The  declined requests to impeach Talmadge but agreed to sue him to recover state funds spent on the hog price manipulation scheme.  When Governor  referred the suit to the state attorney general, however, the request to sue Talmadge was rejected.\n\n\nIn 1932, Governor  ran as a candidate for the United States Senate. Talmadge ran for governor, appealing to white rural Georgia by idealizing the small farmer, and preaching what he said were the true values of rural America, such as rugged individualism, frugality, governmental economy, segregation, limited government, and low taxes. Talmadge won a majority of the  and therefore the primary. Winning the nomination of the Democratic Party was tantamount to automatic victory in the general election. He was sworn in on January 10, 1933.\n\nBecause all counties were given equal weight, the County Unit System gave outsized power to the rural counties, which were Talmadge's base. He boasted, \"I can carry any county that ain't got street cars.\"  He made twelve campaign promises, the most controversial of which was to lower the price of an automobile license to $3, putting them within reach of the poorest farmers.  The state legislature intensely debated the $3 license fee issue, but did not pass it. After it adjourned, Talmadge fixed the $3 fee by proclamation.\n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, President  developed the  with programs to hire unemployed men to work on various public works projects. These were often for needed infrastructure identified by the states. In the South, these jobs offered higher wages than men could obtain in the private sector, and black men were paid the same rate as white men. Many of the wealthy white land-owning families in Georgia soon complained to Talmadge that their sharecroppers preferred to work on the better-paying New Deal public works projects rather than as sharecroppers, and asked the governor to intercede with the president.\n\nIn 1933, one sharecropper wrote to Talmadge: \"I wound't [wouldn't] plow nobody's mule from sunrise to sunset for 50 cents a day when I could get $1.30 for pretending to work on a DITCH\". A disgusted Talmadge forwarded the letter to Roosevelt, together with his own letter that stated: \"I take it that you approve of paying farm labor 40 to 50 cents per day\". Roosevelt wrote back: \"Somehow I cannot get into my head that wages on such a scale make possible a reasonable American standard of living\".\n\nFor all his populism and his self-image as the defender of the small white farmers of Georgia, Talmadge tended to side with the interests of the wealthier land-owning families of the state. He was strongly opposed to Roosevelt's efforts to raise wages in the South, believing that this would undercut the South's only economic advantage, namely of having the lowest wages in the United States. Roosevelt by contrast believed that raising wages would increase consumption and hence spur the economy out of the Great Depression.\n\nWhen Georgia  on September 1, 1934, Talmadge declared martial law during the third week of the strike. He directed four thousand  troops to arrest all picketers throughout the state. He ordered the prisoners to be held behind the barbed wire of a former   camp for trial by a . While the state interned about one hundred or so picketers, the show of force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state. When Talmadge discovered that one of the employers had hired the notorious strikebreaker , he had Bergoff and his two hundred men detained by the Georgia National Guard and deported to New York City.\n\nAlthough often tied to both controversy and corruption, Talmadge was re-elected in 1934, carrying every county but three in the state's Democratic primary. When the Public Service Commission, a body elected by the voters, refused to lower utility rates, he appointed a new board to get it done.  When the Highway Board resisted his efforts to control it, Talmadge declared  and appointed more cooperative members to the board. When the state treasurer and comptroller general refused to cooperate, the governor ordered state police to remove them physically from their offices in the state capitol. Critics denounced him as a dictator, a demagogue, and a threat to the tranquility of the state. His supporters considered him to be a friend of the \"common man\" and one of the state's most outstanding governors.\n\nIn October 1934, Talmadge ousted , the pro-New Deal chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, and replaced him with , a Talmadge partisan. Roosevelt met with Talmadge to ask him to save Cohen's job, a request that was refused, leading the president to suspect that this was the first step by Talmadge toward a possible presidential run in 1936. By late 1934, Talmadge's relationship with Roosevelt was fraying. In December 1934, when Roosevelt decided to spend Christmas at , Talmadge sent a note requesting a private meeting with the president. His staff responded by a note apologizing for Roosevelt not having the time to see the governor, and vaguely promising him a private meeting at the White House sometime in 1935.\n\nBy early 1935, Talmadge was working on an alliance with US Senator  (D-Louisiana), who was planning on running against Roosevelt in 1936. When asked what was discussed at his meetings with Long, Talmadge replied: \"We both cussed Roosevelt\". But, Long had a low opinion of Talmadge's intelligence, saying: \"That Talmadge ain't got the brains to match his ambition\". Beyond a shared antipathy to Roosevelt, the two had almost nothing in common politically. Long, a left-wing populist, had the slogan of \"share the wealth\", promising if elected president he would confiscate all the wealth of the richest Americans and redistribute it to the poor, whereas Talmadge was essentially an old-fashioned Southern conservative. Long criticized Roosevelt for not going far enough with the New Deal, while Talmadge had felt he had gone too far. Finally, both men wanted to run for president and wanted the other to serve as vice president, which proved to be the issue that ended their alliance and made them enemies.\n\nTalmadge governed as a Southern conservative, vehemently attacking the nationalization of President  and the . He objected to policies favorable to black people, the farm programs, and relief-work programs such as the  and . Talmadge believed the New Deal relief programs were encouraging people to be lazy, telling a reporter: \"The way to handle a relief program was like how  was handling it in Italy, namely to line these people up and take the troops and make them work\".\n\nTalmadge tried to build a region-wide coalition, making a national speaking tour in preparation for a challenge to FDR in 1936. Talmadge's main allies were the Reverend , who had been the principal organizer of Long's Share Our Wealth Clubs; , a wealthy Texas businessman who had been a leading Long supporter; and novelist , a white supremacist whose books glorifying the  were very popular at the time. Talmadge's bid was being financed with some $41,000 contributed by , CEO of , together with money from the Raskob and du Pont families.\n\nHis Southern Committee to Uphold the Constitution organized a convention in , in January 1936 that brought together fragments of the old  coalition. The Macon convention turned out to be a media disaster that ended Talmadge's presidential hopes. The populist platform that Talmadge drafted at his Macon convention, with its call for more silver to be mined to support the , more protectionism, more states rights, more isolationism, and less immigration was widely mocked as more appropriate for the 19th century than the 20th.\n\nTalmadge pledged to defend the \"sovereignty of our states and local self-government\" at the upcoming Democratic National Convention. However, Roosevelt, who visited Warm Springs, Georgia, often because of his past polio, was more popular with the poor farmers. Unable to run for re-election in 1936, Talmadge chose to challenge Senator Russell in the , but Russell defeated Talmadge by a landslide and Talmadge's presidential hopes collapsed.  Talmadge's handpicked candidate for governor, Charles Redwine, lost the 1936 Georgia gubernatorial election to pro-New Deal Democrat  by an overwhelming margin.\n\nIn 1936, according to a United Press (UP) article printed in the ''Atlanta Constitution'' on August 21, 1936, titled \"Gene Selects Hitler as Favorite 'Author'\", Talmadge reportedly told a Los Angeles newspaper that while he didn't have time to read many books, he read 's book '''' (\"My Struggle\") seven times. The Nazi publication ''Die Bewegung'' reprinted the interview with Talmadge and praised him, stating that \"Governor Eugene Talmadge, of Georgia, is obviously a very intelligent man.\"\n\nIn 1938, Talmadge challenged incumbent U.S. senator . Though George had sided with 34 of Roosevelt's 44 New Deal proposals, he refused to support some of the proposals in Roosevelt's second term. The president believed George had been \"put out to pasture\". Roosevelt tried to purge George and campaigned for his own candidate, . George, however, refused to criticize Roosevelt during the campaign and blamed the purge on Roosevelt's advisers.  Despite the divide among the New Deal vote, George easily won the renomination, securing 141,922 popular votes and a majority of 246 county unit votes, while Talmadge won just 102,464 popular votes and 148 unit votes. Talmadge's victory over Roosevelt's candidate Camp, who secured just 78,223 popular votes and 16 unit votes, surprised his critics.\n\n\n\nTalmadge was elected again as governor in 1940 and returned to the governor's office in 1941, emerging as the leader of racist and segregationist elements in Georgia.  Responding to reports that , a dean at the University of Georgia, had advocated bringing black and white students together in the classroom, Talmadge launched an attack on the university, charging elitism, and called for the regents to remove Cocking and purge the university of communists, \"foreigners\" (non-Georgians), and subscribers to racial equality. The  at first refused Talmadge's demands, but after the governor restructured the board, the university dismissed numerous staff.\n\nThis intervention into academic affairs caused the  to remove accreditation from the Georgia state universities. It also contributed to Talmadge's defeat by  in 1942.\n\nIn 1940–1941, Talmadge took a strongly isolationist line and was opposed to Roosevelt's policy of having America be the \"arsenal of democracy\". He said that money spent in aiding Britain, China and the Soviet Union would have been better spent on helping the poor farmers of Georgia. The fact that Talmadge had an admiration for Hitler and voiced such strong support for Japan's war against China that the Japanese government invited him to visit Japan on all-expenses paid vacation (an offer he declined) led to allegations that he was an Axis-sympathizer. Some commentators felt that Talmadge was merely naive, a man who knew nothing about the affairs of Europe and Asia, while others charged that his authoritarian style of leadership made him naturally sympathetic towards fascist regimes. About the charge that he acted like a dictator, Talmadge replied: \"I'm what you call a minor dictator. But did you ever see anybody that was much good who didn't have a little dictator in him?\" Talmadge's biographer, William Anderson, wrote that Talmadge's admiration for Nazi Germany, his tendency to surround himself with paramilitary followers, and his frequent calls for martial law gave \"an eerie backing\" for his words.\n\nAt the same time, the Cocking Affair had badly damaged Talmadge's reputation. Arnall was a supporter of segregation, whose views on race were essentially the same as Talmadge's, but he presented himself as a supporter of better education for Georgians. Arnall noted that nobody could beat Talmadge in what he cynically called the \"nigger-hating contest\", and argued that the issue in the \"Cocking Affair\" was not white supremacy, as Talmadge claimed, but education. Arnall charged that Georgia's universities losing their accreditation, which Talmadge presented as an achievement on his part, put at risk the futures of all the students attending the universities. At a time when most Georgians were living in poverty and few attended higher education, the possibility that those young people who were lucky enough to attend university or might be would lose their chances to escape lives of poverty was widely regarded as unacceptable. Those Georgians whose children were attending the university were outraged that the futures of their children had been at risk, and those whose children were not attending university had hopes that someday they might.\n\nThe students at Georgia's universities and colleges campaigned vigorously against Talmadge, putting on skits that mocked the governor as a power-crazed buffoon just before football games. They were disproportionately over-represented as volunteers in the Arnall campaign. When Talmadge held campaign rallies, students showed up to chant \"To Hell with Talmadge!\" At one Talmadge campaign rally on July 2, 1942, a Talmadge supporter threw a canister of tear gas at the students, an incident that attracted much negative comment and led to demands that Talmadge discipline his \"hoodlums\" who always patrolled his rallies. Talmadge was so unpopular with students that his campaign workers in the university town of  urged him not to hold a campaign rally there, predicting that more people would come out to boo him than cheer him.\n\nRealizing that Arnall had cast himself as stronger on the education issue, Talmadge changed tactics and announced simply that the loss of accreditation to Georgia's universities did not matter, saying at one rally in a rural area: \"They talk about education. It ain't never taught a man how to plant cotton. It ain't made a garden bloom. It ain't never taught the experience necessary to raise cows and chickens. You gotta git out and do them things, and no school education is going to help ya\". This message was intended to appeal to the white farmers who traditionally supported Talmadge, but may have inadvertently hurt him as even many of Talmadge's rural supporters knew that a better education represented their children's best hope of escaping poverty, and did not appreciate the implied message that the best thing that could happen to their children would be to follow their parents in lives of drudgery and poverty.\n\nAs was always the case, Talmadge presented himself as an aggressive defender of white supremacy, arguing that keeping the black people disfranchised and segregated was far more important than education, a message that appealed to his core supporters, but to nobody else. At one campaign rally, Talmadge stated: \"We in the South love the Negro in his place-but his place is at the back door\". The fact that Arnall had also declared himself a supporter of segregation, albeit not in quite the same crude terms as Talmadge had, meant that for many white Georgians there was no difference between the candidates on \"the Negro question\", and therefore neutralized Talmadge's advantage as a defender of white supremacy. Furthermore, men were more likely to vote for Talmadge than women, and in 1942, many Georgian men were serving in the military, thus leading to women being over-represented in the Democratic primary. In the primary, Arnall won 174,575 votes to Talmadge's 128,394. Even the \"county unit system\", which worked to Talmadge's advantage in the past, failed to save him in 1942. Arnall won 242 unit votes to Talmadge's 149.\n\n\nJust after Talmadge left office in January 1943, it emerged that since 1940 he had been receiving food grown on the state prison farms for free, an allegation that he admitted to, saying he was saving the state of Georgia money by not paying for his food. Shortly afterwards, it emerged that he attended a meeting of the , which he again admitted to, saying that \"everyone had a good time\" at the Klan banquet. In his retirement, Talmadge grew increasingly bitter and became consumed with a violent hatred for Roosevelt. The isolationist Talmadge also deplored the United States fighting in World War II, all the more so as the social changes caused by the war were threatening Talmadge's vision of what an ideal America should be. In particular, the first tentative gains made by the  in the war years enraged Talmadge, who predicated that even the modest gains being made by black Americans during the war would eventually lead to the end of white supremacy in the South.\n\nTalmadge convinced himself that Roosevelt had deliberately engineered the United States's entry into World War II because he wanted to create the social changes that would end white supremacy, causing him to engage in long tirades against Roosevelt, the New Deal, World War II and black Americans. Talmadge's newspaper, '''' printed editorials written by himself claiming that Roosevelt was compromising American sovereignty, making the allegation that the British prime minister Winston Churchill was being allowed to \"meddle\" in the affairs of Congress with Roosevelt's support. In the 1944 election, ''The Statesman'' ran a headline reading \"Election of Roosevelt Means Promoting Negroes in Georgia\". Anderson wrote during the war Talmadge became a \"total cultural isolationist\", a man who saw the world outside of the United States as a dangerous, menacing place and believed increasing American involvement with the world beyond would destroy everything that he held sacred. At the same time, Talmadge, always a heavy drinker, started to drink on a scale that began to seriously damage his health.\n\nAnderson described Talmadge as \"a ghost's voice hellbent on halting the future. But it was a frightened voice, scared that the wave of history had at last washed over the impenetrable culture of his fathers. So easily had his people succumbed to the siren call of change that Gene found himself with one hoary root left, one last undeniable link to yesterday-the black. He alone anchored the old consciousness, the tenacious culture, the old consciousness. Gene Talmadge knew if this one tie was uprooted, his world would be gone forever.\" When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1944 '''' decision that white-only primaries were illegal and ordered Southern states to hold color-blind primaries, Talmadge was enraged; his attempted political comeback was based entirely on a virulently racist platform of upholding white supremacy.\n\n\nDuring Arnall's term, the state legislature lengthened his term to four years and prohibited him from seeking re-election in 1946. Talmadge ran for governor and used the ''Smith v. Allwright'' decision, ruling that the closed white primary was unconstitutional, as his main red flag issue. Talmadge promised that if he were to be elected, he would restore the \"Equal Primary\". Talmadge's family and advisers sought to persuade him not to run, warning that due to his failing health that a grueling campaign might kill him, but he refused to step aside in favor of his son Herman who had been groomed as his heir, saying \"Naw, I'm the only goddamn son of a bitch who can win\". Talmadge's campaign was noted for its violent racist rhetoric as he boasted about assaulting and flogging the black sharecroppers who worked for his family as a young man and he claimed to have chased a black man down the street with an ax because he sat next to a white woman. His 1946 campaign is described by historians as explicitly .\n\nIn June 2007, previously sealed FBI files revealed that Talmadge was investigated by the FBI over suspicions he sanctioned the . Though Talmadge was unpopular in the more populous urban areas, his relative popularity in rural areas gave him a fighting chance of still winning the Democratic nomination under the  \"county unit votes\" system in which (essentially) the candidate who won the most counties, not the most popular votes, would receive the nomination. Even then, Talmadge's opponent, , still polled well in rural counties, though not as well as in urban counties. Several witnesses stated that they overheard Talmadge speaking to George Hester, the brother of a white man stabbed by a black man named Roger Malcolm, outside of the courthouse in Monroe, Georgia, promising he would \"take care of the Negro\" in exchange for the Hester family using their influence to help win Walton County. On July 25, 1946, the car carrying Malcolm, who had been bailed out of jail, was stopped by a group of about 30 white men at Moore's Ford.  Malcolm, his wife Dorothy, and the other black couple riding in the car, George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were marched out of the car, lined up and shot. The FBI agent investigating the lynching called the allegation that Talmadge led the lynch mob  \"unbelievable\", but he forwarded the allegation to FBI director  \"as it may be of some possible future interest.\" Talmadge's grandson, Herman Talmadge Jr, told the press: \"I don't think my grandfather's involved in any lynching. If y'all are that far off, I feel sorry for you.\" About the allegations that it was Talmadge who led the lynch mob at Moore's Ford, the historian Robert Pratt stated: \"I'm not surprised&nbsp;... historians over the years have concluded the violently racist tone of his 1946 campaign may have been indirectly responsible for the violence that came at Moore's Ford. It's fair to say he's one of the most virulently racist governors the state has ever had.\" In 1946, Talmadge won Walton County by only 200 votes.\n\nTalmadge lost the popular vote in the Democratic primary to  but won a majority of the \"county unit votes\". He died in December 1946, before he could be sworn in for his fourth term. The cause of death was hepatitis complicated with the effects of liver cirrhosis caused by his heavy drinking. Talmadge's coffin, while lying in state at the Georgia capital, was decorated with a wreath reading KKKK (Knights of the Ku Klux Klan), an organization that Talmadge had at least been friendly with. His  1946 death right before his inauguration precipitated the 1947 \"\" among Arnall, , and Talmadge's son . While the general assembly elected his son,  to take his father's place, the newly elected lieutenant governor  claimed his right to the governor's office, and also the outgoing governor  refused to leave office.

Although she did not know him, Pope called Brown's Veterans Affairs office to plead for a memorial. Pope called every day for the next six months, until finally Brown's secretary put her call through. Brown agreed to support legislation establishing a memorial. Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson, the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of DAV. DAV was itself not a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit, and thus Pope and Wilson agreed that a new foundation, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation (AVDLMF; also known as the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation) should be created.

He previously represented Georgia's 1st House District in the  from January 14, 2019 to January 14, 2021. At 24 years old, he was the youngest elected official ever from , , and is a supporter of President-elect . On September 28, 2023, the Georgia Senate Republican Caucus indefinitely suspended Moore for attacking his Republican colleagues. Moore was later banned from the House floor in March 2024 for making inappropriate comments during a day of remembrance for late Speaker David Ralston.\n\n\n\n\nMoore was born and raised on his family farm in Dade County, Georgia, where he resides today. As a child, Moore said he \"idolized , seeing him as a figure who acted quickly and boldly\". Moore was the state president of Georgia  under  Monty Rhodes from March 2011 to March 2012. During that time he led more than 25,000 students and 320 advisers.\n\nAt age 18, Moore became a commercial truck driver, and started auctioneering while studying at the University of Georgia. In 2016, Moore graduated from the University of Georgia with a double bachelors in political science and international affairs.\n\nSince graduating college, Moore runs his family's bulldozing and trucking business, and is an auctioneer.\n\n\n\n\nNineteen months after graduating college, Moore, then 24, qualified to run against incumbent  in the House race for District One. Moore's budget was just $3,500 and completely self funded, a tenth of Deffenbaugh's campaign spending. With no declared Democratic opponent, Republican Moore was elected as the presumptive District 1 State Representative on May 22, 2018, after defeating  by a margin of 326 votes with a final tally of 2,184 to 1,858.\n\nIn March 2020, Moore told the press that he would not be running for reelection for his house seat. Moore instead qualified to run for the State Senate seat for District 53 against Jeff Mullis, whom he decried as a \"political boss\" who \"has tried to push me out of my seat\". According to Moore, he ran against Mullis for his alleged mistreatment of those that do not agree with him. Moore was at a financial disadvantage; Moore had $26 while Mullis had $250,000.\n\nIn April 2020, Moore asked Senator Jeff Mullis to debate him in Dade County. Mullis refused, claiming to not wish to participate in a forum controlled by Moore.\n\nOn June 9, 2020, Moore lost the Republican primary election to Mullis. Mullis was later re-elected in November, running uncontested.\n\nMoore later launched his campaign for senator for the 2022 election, again running for Jeff Mullis's seat. In March 2022, Mullis announced he would withdraw from the election following medical issues, claiming he wished to spend more time with his family. Moore later won the Republican primary on May 24, 2022, with 51% of the vote against political newcomer Steven Henry. He was unopposed in the general election on November 8, 2022 and elected to the 53rd senate district.\n\nOn May 21, 2024, Moore won the Republican primary election for state senator with 70% of the vote against newcomer Angela Pence (29.8%). Moore utilized $274,000 in campaign donations while Pence utilized $3,600. Moore was challenged by Democrat Bart Bryant in the 2024 election. On November 5, 2024, Moore won the general election.\n\n\nIn April 2020, Ringgold Mayor Nick Millwood announced his endorsement of Moore instead of incumbent Jeff Mullis. Mayor Millwood cited standing up against unethical politics and legislators, empowering educators, not compromisingly defending constitutional carry and the Second Amendment, and standing up for First Amendment rights as among the many reasons that he endorsed Moore. Millwood said: \"During Colton’s term as a state representative, his frustrations at being blocked and talked down to by Jeff Mullis led him to tackle the problem directly and run for that seat. I admire his tenacity and ability to go right to the source of the problem and launch a public challenge to make a difference\". Moore was also endorsed by .\n\n\nIn 2019 Moore was rated by  as the seventh most conservative legislator in Georgia. He has supported and cosigned bills such as HB 2, HB 481, and the \"Heartbeat Bill\"; supported 10-year term limits; advocated for the end of film subsidies; and supported HB 179 (died in committee) \"which would allow school teachers and administrators to utilize discipline in schools without having it negatively impact their school’s climate ratings\".\n\n\nMoore supported  from the beginning of his campaign, being the first representative-elect to endorse him. On October 15, 2018, Moore acquired the  BrianKemp.com while Kemp was campaigning. Previously, BrianKemp.com had been redirected to  opponent  website, which caused confusion for those looking for Brian Kemp's official website. Moore and friend, Michael Gargiulo, a domain-name expert, \"brokered a five-figure name transaction to buy the rights to the site\". Moore used personal money. Following the purchase, BrianKemp.com displayed accurate links and information about how Colton Moore acquired the . As of May 2024, the URL is now inactive. In November 2018, Moore unofficially campaigned for Kemp. Moore drove a truck that was covered in signs, urging people from Catoosa, Walker and Dade to vote for Kemp. Kemp thanked Moore on social media multiple times, saying that the \"Big Trucks for Kemp Coalition is working hard!” and \"Big thanks to State Representative Colton Moore for working to Get Out The Vote in Northwest Georgia with his 'Big Trucks for Kemp' dump truck!”\n\n\nMoore has also been a strong supporter of  since the beginning of his campaign in 2015. In 2018, Moore extended an \"official invitation\" to President Trump. In November 2018, Trump and Vice President Pence visited Chattanooga, Tennessee to campaign for Senator .\n\n\nIn 2019, Moore was among ten representatives who signed House Resolution 328, calling for Georgia House Speaker  to resign due to his abuse of power and unethical behavior. Ralston leveraged his position as Speaker of the House to postpone his cases more than 900 times. Among Ralston's clients were accused molesters, rapists, and individuals that were accused of committing a violent crime. They confessed that they retained Ralston as their attorney because he could leverage his position in their favor to indefinitely postpone cases. David Shell, a man who has beaten many women, including having been charged by a grand jury as a repeat offender, told the : \"That’s why I gave him 20,000 bucks… He’s worth every penny of it\". Moore wrote a letter to Speaker Ralston that read, \"While legislative continuance is a right all legislators have access to, your use of this right has resulted in an unjust delay of violent criminal cases in our state… District 1 and many citizens across our great state believe you should no longer serve as the leader of Georgia's largest governing body\".\n\n\nIn February 2019, Moore was one of two dissenting votes against naming the judicial complex after former Governor . Moore said that it was not right for Deal to be \"the symbol of justice in Georgia\", as his reforms were \"insufficient\". Moore went on to write a memorandum to Kemp, listing the reasons why it would be an inappropriate choice to name the new judicial center after Deal.\n\n\nIn 2020, Moore became the co- chair of the Georgia branch of the Future Caucus, a bipartisan organization that educates on legislative issues that future generations will face. Moore co-chairs alongside Representative Jasmine Clark.\n\n\nOn August 29, 2023 while appearing on 's \"War Room\" podcast, Moore claimed that his constituents could be \"fighting in the streets\" if Fulton County District Attorney  is not prevented from  for violations of Georgia's RICO statute and other offenses connected with the attempts to . While recalling a conversation with another senator, Moore stated \"I don't want a civil war, I don't want to have to draw my rifle.\" He also suggested that Georgia Republicans \"have the legislative authority to call in the state troopers and bring [the Georgia State prosecutors] in.\"\n\n\n\nOn September 28, 2023, the Georgia Senate Republican Caucus indefinitely suspended Moore, issuing a statement saying \"Moore has knowingly misled people across Georgia and our nation, causing unnecessary tension and hostility, while putting his caucus colleagues and their families at risk of personal harm\". This followed Moore's vocal advocacy for the impeachment of  district attorney , who had indicted  and 18 other people on felony charges. Moore replied, \"The Georgia RINOs responded to my call to fight back against the Trump witch hunts by acting like children and throwing me out of the caucus\".\n\n\nOn March 14, 2024, Moore was banned from the House floor after criticizing late Speaker David Ralston in the Senate chamber. Following remarks by Governor Kemp and former Governor Deal in honor of Ralston, who died in 2022, Moore spoke on the Senate floor, accusing the Georgia Assembly of memorializing \"one of the most corrupt Georgia leaders we’ll ever see in our lifetimes.\" Following Moore's speech, Lieutenant Governor  cut Moore off, and President Pro Tempore John Kennedy apologized to Ralston's family on the Senate balcony. \n\nCurrent House Speaker Jon Burns later denounced Moore's remarks, claiming they were \"some of the vilest you can say about a good man.\" Moore was then barred from entering the House floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He later stated that he had \"an exceptionally happy and secure childhood.\" He attended the , where he performed well academically and played on the school  team. He was made an alternate appointee to the , but when the primary appointee claimed the spot Sanders accepted a football scholarship and enrolled at the  in 1942. He played as a left-handed  on the freshman football team.\n\nWhile Sanders was at college, the United States entered World War II, and in 1943 he left his studies and joined the . He was commissioned as a lieutenant and piloted  aircraft. He named his own bomber \"Georgia Peach\", but was never deployed overseas. After the war he returned to the University of Georgia to complete his studies. He studied law, passing the bar examination in early 1947 and finishing his courses in December. He played with the  and went to the . He was a member of the  fraternity, the , and the school debate team. On September 6, 1947, he married Betty Foy, an art student he had met at the university. They had two children together. Sanders started practicing law in Augusta with Henry Hammond before establishing his own practice with several other partners. He devoted a significant amount of time to practice early on to pay off medical debt after his wife fell ill.\n\n\nSanders garnered an interest in politics from his father, who had served on the Richmond County Board of Commissioners. In 1954, Sanders won a seat in the , successfully defeating a \"\" candidate. Two years later he was elected to the . At the time, a rotation agreement meant the seat was typically held in successive fashion by a denizen of Richmond County, of , and of . He was re-elected in 1958 and 1960, making him the only person to ever serve three consecutive terms from a multi-county Georgia senatorial constituency while the rotation agreements were in use.\n\nIn 1958 Sanders chaired a Senate committee which investigated potential corruption in the Rural Roads Authority during  's tenure. The committee found that the authority spent too much money on construction projects, located new roads without proper consideration, and was ineffective at maintaining existing roads. It recommended that the agency be dissolved and that future rural road projects be allocated based on population density, all financed with a .   became political allies with Sanders as a result of his committee work and made him Senate  in 1959. Vandiver became governor, and that year a federal judge ordered the  to draft a plan to racially desegregate schools. Vandiver called 60 people to the  to discuss either proceeding with desegregation or . Only Sanders and House floor leader Frank Twitty advised desegregation, the former fearing that suspending schools \"would have created a generation of illiterates.\" Vandiver ultimately had schools closed only temporarily while the  revised state segregation statutes. He opposed a proposal to make the school issue subject to a statewide referendum. With the governor's support, Sanders served as president  of the Senate from 1960 to 1962.\n\n\n\nSanders decided to make a bid for higher office in 1962. Initially mulling over a potential race for the office of lieutenant governor which had a retiring incumbent, he had doubts when a similarly-named Atlanta attorney, Carl F. Sanders, declared his candidacy. Carl E. Sanders suspected that the other man had been planted to confuse voters and spoil his chances by another candidate, . Geer denied the allegation. Carl E. Sanders then decided to run for governor. At the time he launched his candidacy in late April, Georgia used the  in its primaries, whereby the candidate who won the majority in most counties secured the party nomination, instead of the candidate which earned the majority of all votes across the state. This system greatly limited the chances of urban candidates for decades. Several weeks into the primary, federal courts declared this method unconstitutional, and left the nomination to be decided by popular vote. Sanders campaigned on \"a platform of progress\", pledging to improve education, reorganize the , revamp mental health and penal institutions, recruit industry, and  the General Assembly.\n\nAlready seeking the nomination in the  primary were former governor Marvin Griffin and incumbent Lieutenant Governor . Byrd withdrew from the race after suffering a heart attack in May. Griffin was a staunch supporter of . He attacked Sanders as too young for the governorship and not committed enough to defending segregation. Sanders supported segregation but felt it was useless to oppose federal integration orders. He promised to \"maintain Georgia's traditional separation\" but said he opposed race-baiting politics and that \"I tip my hat to the past, but I take off my coat to the future.\" He also promised to keep public schools open, even if the federal government ordered them to integrate. Griffin held a rally with Alabama governor-elect , another staunch segregationist, to demonstrate his support for racial separation. Sanders mocked this strategy at his own rally the same day, describing Griffin as \"so weak in his belief in Georgia and her people that he plans to import an outsider to meddle in our affairs. I don't need an Alabama crutch to help me.\" Griffin pledged to oppose federal court orders to integrate and throughout the campaign vilified the \"Negro bloc vote\" in Georgia. Following a confrontation between the white supremacist  and the  at a Klan rally, Griffin offered that he was unsure of how to handle such a situation. Sanders accused the former governor of having prior knowledge of the rally and of bring Klansmen into Georgia. Sanders also accused Griffin of having run a corrupt administration in his previous term. In the primary, he defeated Griffin, receiving 494,978 votes (58.7 percent) to Griffin's 332,746 (39 percent). Most of his support came from urban areas. He then won . He took the oath of office on January 14 and was formally inaugurated as governor the following day. Aged 37 upon his assumption of the office, he was the youngest governor in the country at the time.\n\n\nSanders appointed a Governor's Commission for Efficiency and Improvement in Government, which managed reforms in the penal system, mental healthcare, the civil service, the Highway Department, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Education. He worked with Atlanta Mayor  to bring  teams to the capital city, and in 1963 he recruited a friend, , to fund the creation of the  football team.\n\nSanders campaigned as a racial segregationist and did not actively support the  for blacks when in office, but was forced to address racial issues on several occasions. He was regarded by observers as a racial moderate, and described his own position as \"a segregationist but not a damned fool.\" He regarded both white reactionaries and black civil rights activists as politically extreme. Concerned that racial violence would interfere with his plans to expand Georgia's economy, he said, \"while I am governor we are going to obey the laws, we are not going to resist federal court orders with violence, and we are not going to close any schools.\" He appointed some blacks to state boards and the first blacks to the State Patrol and . Overall, his administration was staffed predominantly by whites and he appointed no black agency heads or judges. When confrontations between different groups over racial issues appeared, he tended to try and negotiate compromises, though he sent state police to Savannah in July 1963 to head off violence and placed police on standby in Atlanta in mid-1966 when Mayor Allen confronted angry black demonstrators. He criticized rioters and testified to Congress against the passage of the , arguing it violated property rights.\n\n\nBy the time Sanders became governor, it was common for this official to wield wide influence over the General Assembly, including being able to essentially name the  and legislative committee chairmen. He was one of the last governors to be able to exercise this amount of authority over the legislature. In 1963  became the first black state senator in Georgia in decades. When guards at the State Capitol informed Sanders that Johnson and his black pages were ignoring signs designating \"white\" and \"colored\" restrooms and water fountains, the governor had the signage removed. Later, Johnson attempted to dine at the Commerce Club, an Atlanta venue frequented by legislators and other members of the state's political and economic elite. The white  refused Johnson service, so he contacted Sanders. Sanders called club founder , who subsequently instructed the maître d' to serve Johnson.\n\n\nSanders was a . Most of his budgeting focus was directed at public education. His administration's 1963 budget recommendation to the General Assembly devoted 56 percent of expenditures to education. At the governor's request, the legislature created the Governor's Commission to Improve Education, with 25 members appointed by the governor. The body included the first black people appointed to a state commission since the . Equipped with the commission's recommendations, the following year he stated that Georgia's education system was a \"modern crisis\" and called for a $30 million increase in taxes to improve schools. This included a 50 cent increase on the tax per gallon on , a 12 cent increase on the tax per case of beer, 1% increase in the , and the elimination of the vendors' commission on collection of the . He further requested that the  be empowered to establish minimum standards and that $100 million in bonds be issued to fund new educational institution construction. The General Assembly incorporated his suggestions with minimal alterations. Over the course of his tenure, schoolteacher and university faculty salaries were raised, 10,000 additional teachers were hired, a record number of new schools were built, new s and vocational schools were created, and a Governor's Honors Program was established.\n\nSanders asked the legislature to appropriate funds for airport construction to attract industry to outlying communities. As a result, 33 new community airports were established in Georgia between 1965 and 1966. Georgia's economy performed well during his tenure, and the state had a budget surplus when he left office.\n\nWhile serving as governor, Sanders supported an attempt by the General Assembly to draft a new state constitution in 1963. The proposed document was prevented from being scheduled for a referendum necessary to ratify it by a , which ruled that since the legislators who had created the constitution were from malapportioned districts, their work was invalid. Sanders was deeply disappointed by the ruling. The decision was later reversed by the , but by then there was not sufficient political will to revamp the constitution. On February 17, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled in '''' that Georgia had to redraw its s to comply with the principle of . The General Assembly had only four days to respond before its session was scheduled for adjournment, but Sanders urged it to redraw the districts. The legislators struggled with the process, and after his own floor leader had resigned the revisions to failure, Sanders visited the House floor on February 21 to encourage the body to keep working. Despite the vocal dissatisfaction of some legislators, a revised districting plan was ultimately passed.\n\n\n  in 1962]]\nShortly after winning election, Sanders visited President of the United States . He was generally supportive of the president's administration and used his  rhetoric.\n\nIn 1964 Sanders appointed a biracial delegation to represent Georgia at the , the first time that black people were represented on the delegation. Sanders explained, \"[T]his is not a social club. This is purely a political organization, based on the fact that every voter should be represented.\"\n\nUnder the  law then in effect, Sanders was ineligible to run for re-election in 1966. In the  campaign that year, he endorsed Democratic nominee , a segregationist, as his successor though the two had disagreed on many issues. At the Democratic State Convention in  on October 15, 1966, Sanders told the delegates: \"A man should be loyal to his country, his family, to his God and to his political partyand don't you ever forget it.\" In his speech, Sanders likened Maddox's  opponent,  , to the \"arrogance of , the chameleon ability of  to switch rather than fight, and the callous concern for human needs that is a throwback to , , and .\" Callaway criticized Sanders for mishandling the state budget surplus, a position which weakened the Republican among anti-Maddox moderate voters. Callaway led Maddox in the popular vote but failed to win a majority, and the Democratic-controlled Georgia General Assembly chose Maddox as governor. Sanders was succeeded by Maddox on January 10, 1967.\n\n\n\nSanders left office at the peak of his popularity and turned down several offers for federal government positions from President Johnson. Instead he returned to mount an unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1970. The other two candidates in the Democratic primary were former state senator  and black attorney . Sanders was initially favored by most political observers as the candidate most likely to win. Early polls conducted at the behest of Carter showed most Georgians held a favorable view of Sanders' previous gubernatorial term. Carter directed his campaign team to frame his opponent as anti-democratic, \"\", \"Atlanta-oriented\", overly liberal, and hostile to George Wallace.\n\nCarter attempted to portray himself as friendly to the \"average man\" and working-class voters, while portraying Sanders as out-of-touch and regularly referring to him as \" Carl\". He also regularly claimed without basis that Sanders had used his time in office to enrich himself. Sanders ran with the slogan \"Carl Sanders ought to be governor again,\" which appeared to some voters as arrogant. Furthermore, while his television advertisements showed him as a man of success while jogging, boating, and flying, Carter's ads focused on his farming background and suggested that Sanders was the candidate of the \"big-money boys\".\n\nCarter's campaign anonymously distributed a photo of Sanders getting doused with a bottle of champagne by a black  basketball player celebrating a victory at a game. The photo communicated several potentially damaging messages about Sanders, including his wealth, an association with alcohol (which was disliked in  rural communities) and a personal connection with a black person. The Carter campaign also published anonymous \"fact-sheets\" which described Sanders as a staunch ally of controversial black legislator  (the two actually disliked one another), noted his attendance at the funeral of civil rights activist , and attacked him for denying Wallace an official visit to the state. At the same time, the campaign set up a fictitious \"Black Concern Committee\" to draw black support away from Sanders by arguing that he had failed to honor promises to the black community during his gubernatorial tenure. Carter's campaign press secretary later described their efforts as a \"nigger campaign\".\n\nIn the September 9 Democratic primary, Carter led with 388,280 votes, while Sanders placed second with 301,179 votes, most of them from blacks or urbanites. With the contest moving to a runoff since no candidate had won an outright majority, Sanders began a series of attacks on Carter. At a press conference shortly after the first primary, he called Carter \"a smiling hypocrite\" and a staunch liberal. When Carter refused to debate him, Sanders hosted a televised , though the absent opponent brushed the event aside, quipping \"Some folks said the chair was ahead.\" After Carter secured the endorsement of segregationist publisher , Sanders' campaign crafted a pamphlet which depicted Carter climbing into a bed with Harris. Sanders' workers also created another pamphlet showing a picture of dilapidated tenant housing on Carter's farm, captioned \"Isn't it time someone spoke up for these people?\" Carter denounced the literature as smear sheets and warned his campaign workers about their distribution. During the last few days of the campaign, Sanders' organization launched an intense effort to fly the pamphlets into far-flung areas of the state. Many were intercepted by Carter supporters posing as Sanders campaigners and destroyed.\n\nIn the runoff primary Carter won with 60 percent of the vote. Sanders received 93 percent of the black vote and the support of his erstwhile backers, but Carter won overwhelmingly in rural areas. He felt guilty about the tactics he had employed, and after his win he called Sanders to apologize for attacking his character. Carter was victorious in the subsequent general election, and was later elected President of the United States in 1976. Sanders remained bitter about the 1970 campaign, and later said of Carter, \"He is not proud of that election, and he shouldn't be proud of it,\" though he also thought Carter made \"more of a class distinction than a race distinction\" in the campaign. He never pursued public office after his loss but remained an active fundraiser for Democratic candidates. He served as the finance chairman of the  during 's gubernatorial tenure.\n\n\n]]\nIn 1967 Sanders joined with several other lawyers to create the firm  in Atlanta. He renewed his focus on the firmwhich was renamed Troutman Sanders in 1992after his loss in the 1970 gubernatorial race and recruited  and  as clients. He became chairman of First Georgia Bank in 1973. He served as chairman of the law firm for thirty years, and in 2006 became its chairman emeritus. At the time of his death, Troutman Sanders had grown to include 600 lawyers. Sanders died in Atlanta on November 16, 2014, at the age of 89, after a fall at his home.\n\nIn recognition of his role in encouraging the construction and expansion of airports in Georgia, he was inducted into the  in 1997. The Carl E. Sanders Family  opened in , Atlanta, in 2000, after a gift to construct it was made in Sanders’ honor by .\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was the son of Susan and Carl Menino, both of Italian descent. Readville was a largely Italian-American community.

In his youth, the Italian-American Menino was exposed to  prejudice.\n\nAfter graduating from  High School in  in 1960. Menino enrolled in three night classes at  before abandoning his college education.  Menino had decided that college was not for him much to his father's dismay.

He remained chairman of this committee for the remainder of his tenure as City Councilor. He earned a reputation for having a strong understanding of the  of how to allocate funds to assist residents. He was known to be a \"vigilant watchdog of the city budget,\" as hailed by ''''. He was a founding member of the City Council's Tourists and Tourism Committee which was created in 1991. Menino received praise for what ''The Boston Globe''s Adrian Walker called \"aptitude for details of city government\", and some criticism for his closeness to Mayor Flynn.

Mayor Flynn accepted the nomination, effectively making Menino, who was President of the  at the time, the presumptive future acting mayor.\n\nMenino had had a longtime friendship with outgoing mayor Flynn. However, their relationship was noted to have become somewhat terser during the period in which Flynn was preparing to hand over the office to Menino. One cause for their rift was that, after Menino had promised he would appoint 100 new police officers when he took office, Flynn beat him to the chase and did so himself, which angered Menino.\n\nUpon Flynn's resignation on July 12, 1993, Menino became acting  until the upcoming November 1993 election. He was the first Italian American to lead the city.\n\nSome initially saw Menino as likely to be a sort of \"caretaker\" of the office, with  of '''' writing at the start of Menino's acting mayoralty, that to some, \"Menino is believed to be a caretaker, a known quantity, a moderate compromise builder who is unlikely to bring great change or wreak serious harm on the city.\" McGregory also reported that some of Menino's City Council colleagues believed that Menino had an undistinguished legislative record as a city councilor.\n\nDuring his acting mayoralty, Menino temporarily appointed Alfreda Harristo to fill a vacancy on the .

Menino's freeze was popular with the city's residents, though there were questions as to whether an ''acting'' mayor actually held the authority to take such action.\n\n\n\n\nMenino would win the 1993 Boston mayoral election, becoming mayor. This made him the city's first non-Irish American mayor since the .\n\nMenino initially ran a low-profile campaign, having informally indicated his intentions ahead of taking office as acting mayor for months. After taking office as acting mayor, Menino ran a sort of \"\" that played up his acting incumbency and leveraged the perks of the office. He formally declared himself as a candidate for mayor on August 16, 1993, after many other candidates had already formally entered the race. A number of actions that he took immediately after taking office were characterized by analysts as shoring up his image for a mayoral run.\n\nWhen running for mayor, Menino pledged to serve \"only two terms, and that's it for me.\" However, his tenure ultimately exceeded this in length. Menino ran for a third term in 2001 and clarified that \"I promised I'd serve two terms–in every century.\" Menino was ultimately elected to a fifth term in 2009.\n\n\n\n\nMenino served an unprecedented and unsurpassed five terms as mayor of Boston.

Menino was heavily favored to win, with an approval rating near 85%. Davis-Mullen lacked in  and additionally faced a slew of stories in ''The Boston Globe'' and ''The Boston Herald'' during her campaign with negative allegations that hurt her public image.

At the time of his 1993 mayoral campaign, Menino took a position supporting an existing municipal  which allowed city employees  or bereavement time in instances in which a domestic partner or other household member has taken ill or died. In 1998, Menino signed an executive order allowing domestic partners and dependents of gay, lesbian, and unmarried municipal employees to receive health benefits from the city. He was among the first mayors in the United States to extend such benefits to same-sex partners of municipal employees. Menino came out in support of  in 2003. At one point, Menino refused to partake in the   parade due to their exclusion of gays. In 2012, Menino headed the Mayors for  effort.

The influx of millions of dollars of new high-priced housing during Menino's tenure contributed to , which had the negative impact of pricing longtime residents out of neighborhoods. More than 12,000 new college  rooms were constructed in Boston during Menino's tenure.\n\nIn 2010, legislation was passed creating a downtown , something Menino had been pushing for since the 1990s.\n\nMenino also known for focusing on neighborhood development in Boston, organizing services by neighborhood, and appointing neighborhood coordinators who serve as ambassadors from the city in their areas, believing that development should happen in every neighborhood.

Menino oversaw the development of the  in , also known as the \"Innovation District\". Menino also gave priority to the redevelopment of  (today known as \"Nubian Square\"). Over his tenure, there was roughly $330 million of private development there.\n\nMenino was involved with negotiating with  ownership and the state of Massachusetts a deal to provide public funds to build a new baseball stadium near the existing . However, the Boston City Council rejected the deal, and the existing Fenway Park was instead renovated. After new ownership abandoned the idea of replacing Fenway Park, Menino supported their efforts to renovate the stadium, and also launched a review of the potential new development in the surrounding neighborhood. Following a 2004 rezoning effort of the neighborhood surrounding Fenway Park, the area began to see major new developments.\n\nAt the end of Menino's tenure, the city was undergoing a construction boom, with Moody's Investor Service having credited the city in 2012, having \"the strongest commercial real estate market in the country since the 2008 recession\".\n\n\n\n\nStudent performance in Boston Public Schools made improvements during Menino's tenure in regards to test scores.

This was accomplished by hosting conferences, seminars, and a speaker series; by providing research funding to BU faculty and students; and by providing fellowship opportunities for students interested in local government.\n\nUnder Mayor Menino, the IOC also created its flagship research project, the recently rededicated Menino Survey of Mayors, the only nationally representative survey of American mayors.

As a result of these various errors, some commentators (such as conservative radio show host and author ) refer to the mayor as \"\"  or \"Mayor Mumbles.\" A typical example of one of his speech errors involves a reference to Boston's parking shortage as \"an  around my neck\" (meaning, instead, an  around his neck), which is a substitution error.\n\nAn example of Menino causing controversy with his choice of words occurred in an interview for the August 28, 2013, issue of the ''''. Menino was quoted as saying that he would blow up Detroit and start all over, in reference to the inaction of the city's leaders. In response, Detroit mayor (and one-time member of the )  questioned his choice of words: \"I would think the mayor of a city that recently experienced a deadly bombing attack would be more sensitive and not use the phrase 'blow up.'\" The comments came just over four months after the . Menino apologized on September 4.\n\n\nMenino met Angela Faletra in 1963 when the two were playing tennis in  on adjacent courts.

One concern was that the Coyotes' arena situation was decreasing the team's revenue due to its limited seating capacity and lack in luxury seating options.

He graduated from  in 1980. He received his bachelor's degree from  in 1984, and he graduated magna cum laude from  in 1990. He practiced law in .\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his tenure in the Senate, Joyce distinguished himself as a fierce advocate for the rights of disabled children and elderly citizens. He was credited with securing hundreds of millions of dollars for public schools in his district, and he was instrumental in the revitalization of the Neponset River and Blue Hills reservations.\n\nIn 2004, after Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage, Joyce preserved equal marriage rights by filibustering a bill that would have banned same-sex marriage. At the time, Joyce explained his decision by stating that \"I believe in an America where no religious body seeks to impose its will, directly or indirectly. Tradition as a rationale for discrimination is not persuasive.\"\n\nIn May 2006, Joyce traveled to Pakistan in support of 's efforts to court the allied nation in the , where he talked foreign policy on state-run , joining then  and New Mexico Attorney General  on a top Pakistani talk show.\n\nJoyce strongly opposed the  during his tenure in office, and he tried repeatedly to ban the Center's use of electric shock treatment on disabled children.

Joyce was under scrutiny for various ethical improprieties alleged by '''' reporters, including having his campaign fund pay for his son's high school  party and accepting free or discounted services from a  in Randolph, Massachusetts. According to the FBI, the raid was part of a federal investigation, though no charges have been filed at that time.\n\nThe nature of the raid has again raised recurring questions about the close relationship between the ''Boston Globe'' and the office of . The Boston's U.S. Attorney's Office has since come under increased scrutiny for abuses of power for political purposes. Many of the Globe's allegations were proven inaccurate by other journalists, who expressed concern that the Globe may have knowingly printed misleading stories about Joyce.\n\nOn February 23, 2016, Joyce announced that he would not seek re-election to the Massachusetts State Senate for the next term.\n\nDuring the winter of 2016, The Boston Globe reported that the federal government has seated a  to look into Joyce's conduct.\n\n\nIn December 2017, Joyce was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges he collected over $1 million in bribes and kickbacks that he laundered through his law office and another personal business. He was arrested by Federal agents on December 8, 2017, for the multiple felony counts of the indictment.\n\nLegal experts have expressed doubt over the merit of the charges against Joyce, and many of the governments' allegations were later disproven. Prosecutors' attempt to disqualify Joyce's attorney was met with alarm by members of the Boston legal community, who viewed it as an unprecedented infringement on a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. The ACLU, along with the Massachusetts Bar Association and dozens of individual Massachusetts attorneys, jointly filed an amici curiae brief defending Joyce's Constitutional right to counsel and rebuking the Government for its overreach. The conduct of federal prosecutors in the case has exacerbated ongoing concerns over the legal ethics of the Boston U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nJoyce pleaded not guilty in December 2017 to charges including , , ,  and scheming to defraud the  (IRS). Joyce was released on a $250,000 bond.\n\nThe 102-page indictment accuses Joyce of turning his law office into a criminal enterprise, going so far as to accept hundreds of pounds of free coffee from a local  owner.\n\nIn January 2018, Joyce's former accountant, John Nardozzi, was indicted on federal charges that he helped prepare and file false tax returns for Joyce, misclassifying over $2 million of personal expenses as business expenses, in order to reduce Joyce's tax burden. In October 2019, Nardozzi was convicted by a jury of helping Joyce cheat the IRS out of approximately $600,000 in tax payments, and in January 2020, Nardozzi was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison.\n\nOn October 8, 2018, US Attorney Andrew Lelling announced that he had dismissed all criminal charges against Joyce, in light of his untimely death.\n\n\nIn the early morning hours of September 26, 2018, Joyce was involved in a single car crash when he reportedly swerved to avoid hitting a , crashing through a telephone pole, and finally stopping after hitting a fence.\n\nOn September 27, 2018, Joyce was found dead in his home in Westport, with no foul play suspected.\n\nOn December 4, 2018, Massachusetts state medical examiner's office reported Joyce's death was caused by an overdose of  and ruled the manner of death was \"acute pentobarbital intoxication\" and remains undetermined, pending a “thorough death investigation.”\n\n\nJoyce was a lifelong resident of Milton, Massachusetts, where he lived with his wife, Mary.

A  , Maddox came to prominence as a staunch  when he refused to serve black customers in his Atlanta restaurant, the Pickrick, in violation of the . As he was ineligible to run for a second consecutive gubernatorial term, he sought and won election as , serving alongside his successor as governor, .\n\n\nMaddox was born in , the second of nine children born to Dean Garfield Maddox, a , and his wife, the former Flonnie Castleberry. Maddox left school shortly before graduation to help support the family by taking odd jobs, including real estate and grocery. He received his high school diploma through correspondence courses. During , Maddox worked at the  factory in  producing\nthe  bomber.\n\n\nIn 1944, Maddox, along with his wife Hattie Virginia (''née'' Cox, 1918–1997), used $400 in savings to open a combination grocery store-and-restaurant called Lester's Grill. Building on that success, the couple then bought property on Hemphill Avenue near the  campus to open up the Pickrick Restaurant.\n\nMaddox made the Pickrick a family affair, with his wife and children also working with him. Known for its simple, inexpensive , including its specialty, , the Pickrick soon became a thriving business. The restaurant also provided Maddox with his first political forum. He placed advertising which featured cartoon chickens in the Atlanta newspapers. Following the 1954 '''' decision of the , these restaurant ads began to feature the cartoon chickens commenting on the political questions of the day. However, Maddox's refusal to adjust to changes following the passage of the  manifested itself when he filed a lawsuit to continue his segregationist policies. Maddox said that he would close his restaurant rather than serve s. An initial group of black demonstrators came to the restaurant but did not enter when Maddox informed them that he had a large number of black employees. In April 1964, more African Americans attempted to enter the restaurant. Maddox confronted the group with a bare  handle. Maddox provides the following account of the events:\n\nMostly customers, with only a few employees, voluntarily removed the twelve Pickrick Drumsticks, (a  for pickaxe handles) from the nail kegs on each side of the large dining room fireplace. They had been forewarned by the arrival of Atlanta's news media of an impending attempted invasion of our restaurant by the racial demonstrators and once the demonstrators and agitators arrived, the customers and employees pulled the drumsticks (pickaxe handles) from the kegs and went outside to defend against the threatened invasion.\n]]\nThe \"invasion\" Maddox referred to was three black seminary students who had asked to be seated.\n\nMaddox gained the approval of segregationists by leasing and then selling the restaurant to employees rather than agreeing to serve black customers. He claimed that the issue was not hostility to blacks, but constitutional property rights. He even built a monument to \"private property rights\" near the restaurant.\n\nThe  at the  contains the following account of the closing of his restaurant:\n\nMaddox closed the Pickrick on August 13 and reopened the business on September 26 as the Lester Maddox Cafeteria, where he pledged to serve only \"acceptable\" Georgians. During a trial for contempt of court on September 29, Maddox argued against the charges because he was no longer offering service to out-of-state travelers or integrationists. On February 5, 1965, a federal court ruled that Maddox was in contempt of court for failing to obey the injunction and assigned fines of two hundred dollars a day for failing to serve African Americans. Maddox ultimately closed his restaurant on February 7, 1965, rather than integrate it; he claimed that  and communists put him out of business.\n\nThe building was purchased by Georgia Tech in 1965; it was used for many years as the placement center and was later known as the Ajax building. It was demolished in May 2009.\n\n\n\n\nDuring his ownership of the Pickrick, Maddox, a Democrat, failed in two bids for mayor of Atlanta. In 1957, he lost to incumbent , for whom the  is named. Hartsfield had pursued a more moderate approach to racial issues. In 1961, Maddox lost to , with whom he split the white vote. Allen's ability to garner virtually all of the black vote provided his margin of victory.\n\nIn 1962, Maddox ran for  as a Democrat, against , a candidate with whom he shared segregationist and  views. In an effort to differentiate themselves from each other, each attempted to paint the other as an extremist. Geer won the race, 55–45%, but Maddox gained attention across the state.\n\nIn the following years, Maddox proclaimed himself a \"Society of Liberty\" martyr intent on opposing a central government which thwarted states' rights and gave special protection to minority groups. He was recognized by his rimless eyeglasses, dome-shaped forehead, bald head, and nervous energy. It was said of Maddox, \"We have a populist revolution in its truest sense moving here. White people who work with their hands see in Lester Maddox a man of their own kind and are fighting to elect him [as governor].\"''Atlanta History'', p. 38 '''' magazine termed Maddox a \"strident racist\"; '''' viewed him as a \"backwoods demagogue out in the boondocks\". According to one account, the former restaurateur's appeal transcended race to embrace a right-wing brand of \"populism\", picturing government, rather than big business, as the villain.\n\n\n\nWhen Maddox sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1966, his principal primary opponent was former governor . That election was still in the era of Democratic Party dominance in Georgia, when winning the Democratic primary was . There was no Republican primary at the time, but there were voters who identified with the Republican Party. Republicans cast ballots in the  Democratic primary election, and some chose the candidate they believed would most likely lose the general election to their nominee, . In the primary, Arnall won a plurality of the popular vote, but he was denied the required majority. Maddox, the second-place candidate, entered the  against Arnall.   finished in a strong third place. Again, some Republicans voted in the Democratic primary runoff. Arnall barely campaigned in the runoff, and Maddox emerged victorious, 443,055 to 373,004.\n\nMaddox quipped that he had been nominated despite having \"no money, no politicians, no television, no newspapers, no , no , and we made it!\" He joked further that Johnson had been \"the best campaign manager I've got even if he did put me out of business\", a reference to the closing of the Pickrick Restaurant to avoid desegregation. On winning the runoff, the  Maddox, who neither smoked nor drank alcohol, described God as his \"campaign manager\".\n\nStunned Arnall supporters announced a write-in candidacy for the general election, insisting that Georgians must have the option of a moderate Democrat beside the conservatives Maddox and Callaway. In his general election campaign, Maddox equated the Callaway Republicans to the  and the 1864  waged in Georgia by   . He criticized the Callaway family  mill, which he alleged had kept wages at $10 a week in . Maddox said that Callaway was unable to relate to farmers, small businessmen, and the unemployed: \"He would be a lot better off if he knew about people as well as dollars.\"  Maddox said that  had hired off-duty police officers to maintain segregation at the tourist park in , but a superior court judge verified that Callaway had an open admission policy at the facility.\n\nCallaway won a  in the general election, becoming the first Republican gubernatorial candidate to top the polls in Georgia since the close of , and Maddox finished second. More than 52,000 wrote in Arnall's name. Under the election rules then in effect, the state legislature was required to elect one of the two candidates with the highest number of votes, which meant that the lawmakers could not consider Arnall. With the legislature overwhelmingly dominated by Democrats, all of whom had been required to sign a Democratic , Maddox became governor. He was sworn in on the evening of January 10, 1967, minutes after the legislature certified his election.\n\n\n\nMaddox campaigned hard for states' rights and maintained a segregationist stance while in office. Upon the , he denied the slain civil rights leader the honor of lying in state in the Georgia state capitol after being told by undercover agents in the Atlanta Police Department that there was a planned storming of the state capitol by participants in the crowd of mourners. No evidence has ever emerged that this was anything more than a rumor; the undercover agents provided no evidence for it other than their statement. As a precaution, Maddox stationed 160 state troopers to surround the capitol. Regardless, the funeral procession, attended by tens of thousands; was entirely peaceful. Maddox called MLK an \"enemy of the people\" after his assassination and refused to attend his funeral. Maddox considered personally raising flags  that had been placed at half-mast at the State Capitol after MLK's assassination and reportedly decided against doing so because news cameras were nearby. In 1968, Maddox endorsed the former Democrat , the then pro-segregation  candidate in the . After leaving office, Maddox said \"“I’m still a segregationist. I’ve told you that 15 times. When are you going to start believing me?”\n\nWhen he was asked what might be done to improve the abysmal conditions in Georgia prisons, Maddox replied that what was really needed was a better class of prisoner. Maddox's chief of staff was , who went on to serve two terms as governor in the 1990s and as 's successor in the U.S. Senate.\n\nMaddox received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from  in 1969.\n\nIn 1968, a small Atlanta repertory company produced a play entitled ''''. The play ridiculed Maddox and imagined him winning the , then starting a war with the . The show came to Broadway and ran for forty-one performances at the  before closing. Maddox was a supporter of the  because of his anti-communist views, and he often told Georgia about the threats of communist and socialist influences.\n\n\n\nIn the 1966 campaign, the '''' forecast that as governor, Maddox would \"tell off the federal government forty times a day, but four years after his inauguration, he would have accomplished little else\". Once in office, however, Maddox accomplished the following:\n\n* Maddox was favorably influenced by Murray M. Silver, Esq., General Counsel of the Georgia Department of Labor, and Commissioner Sam Caldwell to hire blacks and to approve legislation affecting unemployment insurance of automobile workers within the state.\n* Maddox integrated the Georgia State Patrol, appointed the first African American to head a state-wide government department, appointed the first African American Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent, appointed the first African American to a draft board in Georgia, integrated Georgia's farmer's markets' lines, and directed state troopers not to address African Americans as \"niggers\".\n* Maddox introduced Little People's Day where normal people could meet the governor twice a month. After 4 escaped African-American convicts met with him on Little People's Day and informed him about terrible conditions in state prisons, Maddox launched an investigation of state prisons and ordered state prisons to make improvements. \n\nYears after Maddox's gubernatorial term ended, Republican  described Maddox as a \"far better governor than his critics will ever admit\". Blackburn, a former U.S. representative, also noted that no accusation of corruption was made against Maddox, whose administration was characterized by economic development and the appointment of African Americans to state executive positions.\n\n\nUnder the Georgia constitution of 1945, Maddox was  from running for a second consecutive term. He therefore waged his second bid for lieutenant governor, the first having resulted in defeat to Peter Zack Geer in 1962.  Although Maddox was elected as a Democratic candidate at the same time as 's election as governor, the two were not s; in Georgia, particularly in that era of Democratic dominance, the winners of the primary elections went on to easy victories in the general elections without campaigning together as an official ticket or as running mates.  Carter and Maddox found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding with each other.\n\nShortly after that election, Maddox appeared as a guest on '''' on December 18, 1970.  During a commercial break, fellow guest and former football player  asked Maddox if he had \"any trouble with the white bigots because of all the things you did for blacks\".  On the air, Cavett substituted the word \"admirers\" in place of \"bigots\", enraging Maddox. After demanding an apology from Cavett, and getting a carefully worded form of it, following further conversation, Maddox still walked off the show. Making light of the incident during a subsequent appearance by Maddox, Cavett walked off this time, and Maddox applauded. \n\nBecause the lieutenant governor was a mostly ceremonial role, Maddox spent most of his time as lieutenant governor preparing for a run for governor in 1974. Maddox was considered to be a near shoo-in to regain the governor's mansion in 1974, with the New York Times predicting that only Johnny Wayne could beat him for Georgia governor. However, Maddox was instead forced into a runoff for the Democratic nomination, where he was shockingly defeated by .\n\n\nWhen Carter ran for president in , Maddox ran against him as the nominee of Wallace's former , saying that his former rival was \"the most dishonest man I ever met\".  Maddox and running mate , the former mayor of , , received 170,373 votes in the election (less than 1% of the vote) and no electoral votes.\n\n\nWith his political career seemingly over and with massive debts stemming from his 1974 gubernatorial bid, Maddox began a short-lived nightclub comedy career in 1977 with an  musician, , who had worked as a busboy in his restaurant.Bobby Lee Fears was a native of Atlanta, who had previously worked as a guitarist and vocalist for the Fabulous Denos, who had a number of releases on the King label. He later joined an early incarnation of the  before cutting around three solo records under his own name and using the alias Bobby Dixon. Fears had served time in prison for a drug offense before Maddox, as lieutenant governor, was able to assist him in obtaining a pardon. Calling themselves \"The Governor and the Dishwasher,\" the duo performed comedy bits built around the Governor's subjugation over the Dishwasher, the Dishwasher's lack of intelligence, and musical numbers with Maddox on  and Fears on .\n\n\n\n\nAfter  was shot down in 1983, with   aboard, a special election was held to fill his seat in Congress. Lester Maddox stated his intention to run for the seat if McDonald's wife, Kathy McDonald, did not. However, Kathy McDonald decided to run, and Maddox stayed out of the race; she lost to Democrat .\n\nMaddox had been using drugs from a Bahamian cancer clinic to treat his prostate cancer. In July 1985, he revealed that the clinic had been shut down by Bahamian officials after its drugs had been found to be contaminated with the  virus. Maddox underwent testing, and two months later announced that he was free of the virus.\n\nDuring the  in January of that year, Maddox attended a rally organized by members of the  after the group had attacked several dozen marchers who were protesting against racial discrimination in the county. , a white supremacist who had previously been imprisoned for bombing a  in 1958, was also at the rally.\n\n\nMaddox made one final unsuccessful bid for governor in 1990, then underwent heart surgery the following year. In the 1990 Democratic primary for governor, Maddox finished with about three percent of the vote. He remained a visible figure in his home community of  for the remainder of his life. In 1992 and 1996, Maddox crossed party lines and endorsed unsuccessful populist Republican  for the presidency. His last public speech was in Atlanta in 2001 at the annual national conference of the . The CCC, of which Maddox was a charter member, is considered by the  and the  to be a  group.\n\n\nIn 1935, Maddox married seventeen-year-old Hattie Virginia Cox. Maddox's wife nursed him through all his illnesses and supported his political and business career, even though he had to spend much time away from the family.\n\n\nOn June 25, 2003, after a fall while recuperating from intestinal surgery in an Atlanta , Maddox died of complications from  and . He and his wife Virginia are both interred at Arlington Memorial Park in  in northern Fulton County, Georgia. Due to a successful business career, Maddox was relatively wealthy when he died.\n\n\nAfter Maddox's death in 2003, , the former , said of the former governor: \"He had a reputation as a segregationist, but he told us he was not a segregationist, but that you should be able to associate with whoever you wanted. He went on to do more for African Americans than any governor of Georgia up until that time.\" This view is not universally shared. In its obituary of the former governor, '''' called him an \"arch segregationist\"; to support this contention, the ''Times'' noted that his convictions included \"the view that blacks were intellectually inferior to whites, that integration was a Communist plot, that segregation was somewhere justified in scripture and that a federal mandate to integrate [all-white] schools was 'ungodly, un-Christian and un-American.'\" Despite this, the obituary notes that after becoming governor, Maddox \"surprised many by hiring and promoting blacks in state government and by initiating an early release program for the state prison system\".\n\nThe Interstate Highway 75 bridge over the  at the boundary of  () and  (Atlanta), is named the \"Lester and Virginia Maddox Bridge\".\n\nMaddox was the primary inspiration for 's 1974 song \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bruce Galphin, ''The Riddle of Lester Maddox'' (Atlanta: Camelot, 1968).\n*Brad Rice, \"Lester Maddox and the Politics of Populism,\" in ''Georgia Governors in an Age of Change: From Ellis Arnall to George Busbee'', ed.

He was previously a member of the .\n\n\nArroyo first ran for a seat on the  in 2019; at the time, he was working as a . He successfully won the District 5 ( and ) seat on the council in the November 2019 election, took office in January 2020, and was re-elected in the November 2021 election.\n\n\nIn June 2020, Arroyo (along with , , , and ) was one of five members of the Boston City Council to vote against Mayor 's 2021 operating budget for the city. Arroyo criticized the budget as insufficiently addressing the issue of equity, and pointed out that matters such as fair housing, the city's Disabilities commission, and support services for  received far less funding than the .\n\nArroyo was a prominent backer of an ordinance that would advance a home rule petition to make the  an elected body. The ordinance passed the city council 7–5 on February 15, 2023, but was ed two days later by Mayor Michelle Wu who felt it was an inopportune time to change the board structure.\n\nIn early February 2022, Arroyo announced his candidacy for the position of  (DA) of  (, , , and ), Massachusetts. The position had previously been held by , prior to her appointment as  for the . , appointed by Massachusetts governor  as interim DA, declared his candidacy shortly afterwards. Arroyo and Hayden both gained spots on the Democratic ballot in the primary election scheduled for September 6, 2022.\n\nIn the course of the election campaign, '''' reported that police had previously investigated Arroyo for  reports in two separate instances, in 2005 and 2007. (Neither investigation resulted in charges.) Arroyo lost several key endorsements in the wake of the reports. Following the Democratic primary election held on September 6, and with results showing Hayden with a lead of approximately seven points (53.8% to 46.2%), Arroyo conceded the race via  the following morning. After the past sexual assault accusations surfaced, City Council President  suspended Arroyo from his City Council Committee Chairmanships. In a September 14,2022 Council meeting over half of the Council, not including Arroyo, rose to demand he be reinstated to his Chairmanships.  Arroyo was formally reinstated to his Chairmanships soon thereafter. In April of 2024  paid a $5000 fine to the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission who concluded that Hayden improperly used his office to discredit his political opponent – then-Boston city councilor Ricardo Arroyo – who was challenging him in the Democratic primary.\n\nArroyo and councilors  and  introduced an ordinance to create an Office of Cultural Affairs in the city. While the city council passed the ordinance in October 2023, it still needed Mayor Wu's signature to take effect.\n\nIn 2023, Arroyo ran for reelection to the Boston City Council and lost in the primary election.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn August 23, 2022, '''' published an article regarding two instances of  reports involving Arroyo that were investigated by police in 2005 and 2007. Arroyo was not charged in either instance, and he denied the allegations reported by the ''Globe''. An attorney, speaking at a news conference on behalf of the 2007 complainant, stated that Arroyo never assaulted her client. Further that her client thought the ''Globe'' twisted her words. Arroyo stated that he was unaware of allegations until being informed by the ''Globe.'' He was required to disclose being the subject of any criminal investigation that he may have been aware of when applying for his law license in 2014. The report led to the withdrawal of some endorsements in his run for the Suffolk DA position. The president of the Boston City Council, Ed Flynn, also removed Arroyo from two committee chairmanships and from his position as vice president of the council. On August 30, the ''Globe'' published comments from an August 29 interview with the woman who accused Arroyo of assault in 2005she stood by her accusations of coerced sex by Arroyo. The following day, Arroyo lost the support of senators  and  and Boston mayor , as they withdrew their endorsements of him for Suffolk DA. Arroyo pursued the police records in Suffolk Superior Court seeking their release to the public which was partially granted by Judge Squires Lee.  Included in the release was an email by the Assistant District Attorney assigned to the case stating, “There was no crime committed,” wrote Assistant District Attorney Tara Burdman in a Feb. 17, 2006, e-mail to an investigator about the allegations made by Arroyo’s high school classmate. In an unredacted version of the e-mail obtained by the Globe, Burdman goes on to say, “There is no indication that [defendant] threatened or was violent towards [victim].” The records also showed that Boston Police had closed the investigation as \"unfounded\" which the Boston Police Department defines as “investigation revealed that conduct did not occur.”\n\n\nOn May 17, 2023, the US Dept of Justice released the results of two parallel investigations into ethical misconduct by US Attorney .US Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Oversight and Review Division. \"An Investigation of Alleged Misconduct by United States Attorney Rachael Rollins.\" May 2023. During Arroyo's campaign, Rollins had become aware that her federal US Attorney's Office was likely to begin an investigation into criminal allegations against Interim District Attorney  for his alleged mishandling of a transit police misconduct investigation. Both reports showed that Arroyo and Rollins had communicated about Arroyo's campaign throughout July, August, and September 2022, and that he had sought her guidance as a campaign advisor. Ultimately, Arroyo did not win election to be Suffolk County District Attorney. He conceded the race to his opponent Kevin Hayden on September 6.\n\nTwo days after the release of the investigations into her misconduct, Rollins resigned her office on May 19. Arroyo defended his actions in interviews and social media pointing out that the investigations did not allege misconduct by him.\n\nArroyo received criticism from several colleagues on Boston City Council. Councilor Erin Murphy said he should \"consider resigning\" after the release of the reports. City Council President Ed Flynn said in a statement \"Recent reports and troubling information has once again cast a shadow over the Boston City Council...the residents of Boston deserve better.\"\n\n\nOn June 27, 2023, the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission announced that Ricardo Arroyo in a Disposition Agreement had \"admitted to violating the conflict of interest law by continuing to represent his brother [Felix Arroyo] in a civil lawsuit against his brother and the City of Boston after he became a City Councilor.\" Ricardo Arroyo agreed to pay a $3,000 fine.\n\nAccording to the Ethics Commission, Ricardo Arroyo had acted as his brother's attorney prior to January 2020. Ricardo Arroyo became a city councilor that January, and continued to serve as attorney for over a year.\n\n\nIn April of 2023, a city council attorney filed an internal complaint against Arroyo and fellow councilors  and  accusing all three of bullying and lambasting her during an April meeting. Arroyo's version of events differed “The entirety of this exchange was between myself and Councilor  on the floor, on video, in front of media and the public,” he said in a statement. He said his remarks were directed only at Flynn, and were not discriminatory towards O’Donnell. Because the back-and-forth occurred during a council recess, the cameras were turned off and it was not captured on video. A ''Boston Globe'' report from the meeting describes Flynn and Arroyo having a “frosty exchange.” The complaint was leaked to the ''Boston Herald'' in August of 2023 during the three Councilors' re-election campaigns, leading to the public revelation that due to geotag location data embedded in the photographs of the complaint that were leaked it could be traced to City Council President Ed Flynn's home.\n\n\nArroyo's father, , and brother, , both previously served on the Boston City Council as at-large members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

McMurtry ran as an independent having not held any prior elected office. He won a plurality of the vote in the three way race, garnering 37.6% of the vote overall and 53.8% in his hometown of Dedham.

His involvement in this issue was complicated by his dual role as both a state representative and a local business owner, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nMcMurtry's early legislative priorities centered on economic growth and infrastructure. He supported the development of Westwood Station while advocating for measures to minimize traffic congestion on Canton Street, which connects Dedham and Westwood.\n\nIn 2008, McMurtry became a central figure in a heated legislative battle to grant  supermarket a beer and wine license at the planned $1.5 billion Westwood Station development.

He served as  from 2009 to 2020, having succeeded , who resigned due to allegations of an ethics violation.\n\nAs of 2021, DeLeo is a  at Northeastern University. \n\nDeLeo represented the , and before becoming House Speaker, was the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. The Nineteenth Suffolk district includes Winthrop and .\n\nIn addition to serving as a state representative, DeLeo served as a Winthrop town meeting member from 1977 to 2005 and was a member of the town's board of selectmen from 1978 to 1988.http://www.malegislature.gov/People/Profile/rad1 Massachusetts Legislature profile\n\nOn December 16, 2020, it was reported that DeLeo would be stepping down as Speaker for a job at Northeastern University. He resigned both his house seat and speakership on December 29.\n\n\nDeLeo resides in the same house in which he grew up. When he was young, his father, Al, was in charge of a restaurant at . Al was often seen around the community including at the Winthrop Golf Club, but \"DeLeo never took up the game\". DeLeo attended solely Boston area schools, graduating from the , attaining a Bachelor of Arts degree from  and a Juris Doctor from .\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring DeLeo's time in the  between 1990 and 2005, he was known as \"an amiable, rank-and-file lawmaker who focused on constituent issues such as toll hikes, the expansion of Logan Airport, and rates charged by the \".\n\nIn 2005, Speaker  appointed DeLeo as chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means. According to the ''Globe'', \"He became so identified with handing out perks to members that earmarks became known as DeLeo Dollars\".\n\nPrior to becoming the Speaker of the House, DeLeo had created a reputation for himself as a \"consensus-builder\", someone who strived to prevent \"major flareups while crafting the budget\". He does not ideologically identify himself with a large number of issues or legislation, but \"his views appear more conservative\" than the former speaker, DiMasi. Unlike DiMasi, who was strongly in favor of defending gay marriage rights, DeLeo was originally against same-sex marriage.  In 2007 DeLeo may have shown a change in this belief when he voted against the amendment that would have defined marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Another conservative opinion that DeLeo has is against the \"right of women to have an abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a mother's life\".\n\n\n\n\nIn early 2008, both DeLeo and  put themselves forward as candidates if the state house speakership, held by legally embattled lawmaker Salvatore DiMasi, became vacant. When the position became available in January 2009, there was an animated competition for the position. Rogers ultimately conceded to DeLeo and urged lawmakers to vote for him as the house speaker. DeLeo was elected speaker by a  137–16 vote of the state house.\n\nIn April 2011, DeLeo led a vote to remove the  health-care related collective bargaining rights of Massachusetts police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other municipal employees. The vote was conducted at 11:30pm in order to avoid protesters. It passed with 111 in favor and 42 opposed.\n\n at a  event in 2016]]\nDuring the 2014 corruption trial of former probation commissioner John O'Brien, prosecutors alleged that DeLeo had participated in the job-trading as a means of getting elected Speaker. Although he was never formally charged, DeLeo was labeled an \"unindicted co-conspirator\" by Federal prosecutors. A number of prominent politicians, including Boston Mayor  came out in his defense.\n\n\nDeLeo reintroduced the gambling debate to the House of Representatives in his first months as speaker. Gambling legislation introduced under DiMasi had failed. In the beginning of February 2009, DeLeo met with Governor  to discuss policy plans as part of the leadership meetings, where this issue of slot machines and resort casinos first presented itself under DeLeo's leadership. The casino debate was initially supported by the general public; the State House News Service poll at the time showed 57% support for reintroducing the gambling debate.\n\nTowards the end of 2009, DeLeo began to publicly support casinos as a way to increase revenues, and minimize the effects of the economic downturn.  DeLeo stated in an interview with ''The Boston Globe'', \"I'm hoping this will not just be a gaming bill, but also an economic development one\".  By December 2009, DeLeo had shown favor to putting slot machines in the state's four racetracks; Patrick, however, had shown opposition along with Senate President  who stated that her preference was resort casinos. DeLeo stated that the slot machines were a \"natural progression\" to casinos, and they would have the advantage of being installed quickly. The conflict between DeLeo and Patrick was further exacerbated by the fact that against Patrick's wishes the debate had been postponed until 2010. The gambling debate became complicated further by the economic recession which had taken its toll on the casino industry.\n\nOn March 4, 2010, DeLeo announced his blueprint for expanded gambling to the . His plan included two resort casinos and 3,000 slot machines at the state's four racetracks. DeLeo added that the legislation would add jobs and part of the revenue would be put aside for capital investments for Massachusetts businesses. While Patrick had not stated that he would veto legislation which included slots at racetracks, he had made it clear that he was not in favor of adding slots to the gaming debate.\n\nAs the debate continued tensions between Patrick and DeLeo grew over the issue of slots in the racetracks, by July 2010 Patrick had called the addition of slots \"a no bid contract\" that would give a few developers all of the gaming contracts for slots. DeLeo retorted that his plan for expanded gaming was Massachusetts' best way to deal with the revenue shortfalls, and lack of jobs. At this point, a number of groups opposed to the expanded gaming bill had gained a voice on the state level and the whole process began to lose steam.\n\nOver the next few months the debate shrank from two casinos and four tracks to two casinos and one track at which point Patrick was still unwilling to compromise.  By August, DeLeo had entrenched himself into the position of continuing to push for the bill while simultaneously rejecting any additional compromises. Patrick had rejected the measure, and with the end of the full session and the majority of the Legislature on summer break it became apparent that the bill would not survive.\n\n\n\n\nHe is the father of two children, Robbie and Rachele.Matt Viser.

Missouri State Auditor|url=https://auditor.mo.gov/aboutus/auditor|access-date=2020-09-25|website=auditor.mo.gov}}\n\nShe served as secretary/treasurer of the Missouri Technology Corporation, helping invest in entrepreneurs to create jobs for Missourians. She held the same role for the Missouri County Employees' Retirement Fund to safeguard retirement benefits of 16,000 Missouri residents in 111 counties across the state and spearheaded the initiative to ensure equally protected benefits of county employees in same-sex marriages.\n\n\nGalloway served as treasurer of  from April 2011 until her appointment as state auditor four years later. As county treasurer, she managed a $100 million investment portfolio and issued all general obligation and revenue bonds for the county. Galloway developed a debt issuance policy in 2012 that provided increased transparency. In 2011, Boone County became the first Missouri county to maintain an online search and claim system for unclaimed property which oversaw the distribution of approximately $20,000 in unclaimed property in 2014.\n\nDuring her service as County Treasurer, Galloway served on the Missouri Technology Corporation and Missouri County Employees’ Retirement Fund.

The state auditor's staff is made up of CPAs, with about 65 percent of all audit staff having at least one professional license, certification or advanced degree. Employment as an auditor with the State Auditor's Office qualifies as mandatory experience required for licensure by the Missouri State Board of Accountancy as a certified public accountant.\n\nAdditional responsibilities of the State Auditor's Office included serving as the independent, professional watchdog for government. The State Auditor's Office works to ensure the proper use of public funds and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Missouri government by performing audits of state agencies, boards and commissions, the circuit court system, the counties in Missouri that do not have a county auditor, and other political subdivisions upon petition by the voters. These audits examine financial accountability, waste, opportunities for fraud, and whether government organizations and programs are achieving their purposes and operating economically and efficiently.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Auditor Galloway released an audit showing $300,000 missing from the Callaway County Collector's Office from January 2016 to March 2018. The former county collector pleaded guilty in federal court to embezzling the funds.\n\nOn March 4, 2019, former Callaway County Collector Pamela Oestreich was sentenced to two years and six months in federal prison without parole for embezzling more than $300,000 from taxpayers in .\n\n\nIn 2017, Auditor Galloway released an audit that uncovered a billing scheme in which Putnam County Memorial Hospital billed insurance companies for lab services conducted across the country. The questionable activity began in September 2016, after the Putnam County Hospital Board hired David Byrns and his company, Hospital Partners Inc., to take over day-to-day management of the hospital. The auditor's report uncovered $90 million in inappropriate lab billings. The findings of the audit were covered by national news outlets and resulted in calls for a federal investigation into hospital billing schemes.\n\nFollowing the audit, dozens of major insurers banded together to file lawsuits against affiliated hospitals in Missouri and other states, demanding hundreds of millions in restitution. The lawsuits describe the lab-billing operation as a \"widespread fraudulent scheme\".\n\n\nOn June 21, 2017, Auditor Galloway released an audit showing that the city clerk of  stole $100,000. Dana Mayberry served as the Viburnum City Clerk for 14 years. The city identified inconsistencies in accounts she oversaw after she lost her reelection bid in April 2016.&nbsp;At that time, most of the city and municipal division records disappeared in the Iron County town of less than 1,000 residents. Mayberry admitted to stealing city funds, after which the mayor notified the State Auditor's Office. An audit began in August 2016 after the Viburnum Board of Aldermen authorized one. The examination began to uncover a scheme in which the former clerk adjusted customer utility accounts and then destroyed records and other evidence. The former city Clerk was charged with receiving stolen property, a Class B Felony as a result of the audit. On August 15, 2018, the former city Clerk was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to pay the City of Viburnum $100,000.\n\n\n\nIn May 2017, the Missouri Alliance for Freedom, a Republican-aligned  group, submitted three open-records requests to the Office of State Auditor. The requests sought a wide variety of communications, including those specifically concerning the auditor's scrutiny of the .Nicholas Phillips, , ''St. Louis Magazine'' (February 8, 2020). The State Auditor's Office produced approximately 47,000 pages at no charge to the Missouri Alliance for Freedom, including 254 screenshots of text messages to and from the state auditor.\n\nIn 2017, the Missouri Alliance for Freedom sued the State Auditor's Office and filed a  complaint with Republican Missouri attorney general  alleging that Galloway \"unlawfully withheld public records from her state-provided cell phone.\" In February 2018, Hawley's office issued a report that found Galloway complied with the Missouri Sunshine Law. The same month, the judge dismissed the majority of the claims against the State Auditor's Office, and ordered the Missouri Alliance for Freedom to re-plead its claims. In January 2019, following a trial, Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem ruled against the Missouri Alliance for Freedom on all claims, ending the suit with a judgment in favor of Galloway. The judge concluded that the State Auditor's Office had made \"an enormous good-faith effort to comply with several very large public records requests\" and found that the office's records custodian did not apparently realize (until it was too late) that the phones issued by the office to Galloway and to employees automatically deleted text messages after 30 days. The Missouri Alliance for Freedom chose not to appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalloway was appointed to the post of  by Governor  in 2015 following the death of Republican Auditor . She won election to a full term as Missouri State Auditor on November 6, 2018. She opted not to run for reelection in  and her term expired in January 2023, leaving the Democrats with no statewide elected offices in Missouri, when Republican  was sworn in as State Auditor.\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2019, Galloway announced that she was seeking the Democratic nomination for the  and officially won the primary on August 4, 2020. Galloway faced incumbent Republican governor  in what was anticipated to be a close race.\n\nParson, a former lieutenant governor who assumed the post following the resignation of  in June, 2018, announced in September 2019 that he would seek a full term as governor. In her campaign announcement video, Galloway emphasized her record in exposing public corruption, pledged to reduce the influence of special interest groups on the Missouri legislature, and attacked the Parson administration for its efforts to curb the effects of a government transparency initiative that was passed by statewide ballot in 2018.\n\nAt the time, Galloway was the only Democratic politician holding statewide office in Missouri, as well as the only female officeholder.  She lost the election to incumbent Republican governor Mike Parson by nearly 17% (almost half a million votes). Had she won the election, she would have become the state's first female governor.\n\n\nGalloway's endorsements included former president , former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate , U.S. Senator , New Jersey Governor , U.S. Representative from Missouri's 5th District ,  , former  minority leader .

She won re-election for a third Senate term in  against Republican nominee John Deaton.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in  on June 22, 1949. She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a , and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a   during , both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church. Warren has described her early family life as teetering \"on the ragged edge of the \" and \"kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails.\" She and her three older brothers were raised .\n\nWarren lived in , until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at , had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work. After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building. Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make  payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at . When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.\n\nWarren became a star member of the debate team at  and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to  (GWU) at the age of 16. She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert \"Jim\" Warren, whom she had met in high school.\n\nWarren and her husband moved to , where he was employed by . She enrolled in the  and graduated in 1970 with a  degree in speech pathology and audiology.\n\nThe Warrens moved to  when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, . After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled at . She received her  in 1976 and passed the  shortly thereafter. Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander.\n\n\nIn 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school, Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school. During law school, she worked as a summer associate at . After receiving her  and passing the , Warren offered legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.\n\nIn the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to  and middle-class . She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\nWarren began her career in academia as a lecturer at   (1977–1978). She then moved to the  (1978–1983), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained  in 1981. She taught at the  as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the  from 1983 to 1987 and was also a visiting professor at the  in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught .\n\n's 1987 yearbook.]]\n\nWarren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the  movement, which aimed to apply  to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the '''', argued that  were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted. But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law. According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate  but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts. Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues  and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book ''As We Forgive Our Debtors'' in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as \"worse than disillusionment\" and \"like being shocked at a deep-down level\". In 2004, she published an article in the '''' in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy.\n\nWarren joined the  as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an  in 1990, becoming the  Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at  as the  Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become  Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996, she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not an administrator, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876, including moving expenses and an allowance in lieu of benefits contributions. , she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university. Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and . From 2005 to 2009, Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields.\n\nWarren began to rise in prominence in 2004 with an appearance on the Dr. Phil show, and published several books including ''''.\n\n\nIn 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission's chair, former congressman , asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren's during their school years. She helped draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers' right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the , which curtailed consumers' ability to file for bankruptcy.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the  (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion. She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law, a former vice president of the  and a member of the .\n\nWarren's scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the  in 2011.''''''\n\n\n's nomination as the first director of the , July 2011.]]\n\nOn November 14, 2008,   appointed Warren to chair the five-member  created to oversee the implementation of the .

During Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, , bank stress tests, the impact of the  (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics.\n\n\n at the  conference in 2011]]\nWarren was an early advocate for creating a new  (CFPB). The bureau was established by the , signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren  and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency. While  groups and  groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, financial institutions and  members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, in January 2012, Obama appointed former   to the post in a  over Republican senators' objections.\n\n\nA close high-school friend told '''' in 2019 that in high school Warren was a \"diehard conservative\" and that she had since done a \"180-degree turn and an about-face\". One of her colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin said that at university in the early 1980s Warren was \"sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude\". , who had been a colleague of hers at the , recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he \"almost fell off [his] chair... She's definitely changed\". Warren was registered as a  from 1991 to 1996 and voted Republican for many years. \"I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets\", she has said. But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in , for .\n\nWarren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed neither should dominate. According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn September 14, 2011, Warren declared her intention to run for the  nomination for the  for the . Republican  had won the seat in a  after 's death. A week later, a video of Warren speaking in  went  on the Internet. In it, Warren responds to the charge that asking the rich to pay more taxes is \"class warfare\" by saying that no one grew rich in the U.S. without depending on infrastructure paid for by the rest of society:\n\n\n\nPresident Obama later  in a .\n\n\nWarren ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination and won it on June 2, 2012, at the state Democratic convention with a record 95.77% of the votes of delegates. She encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August, the political director for the  commented that \"no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren\". Warren nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, more than any other Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to '''', \"that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win\". | issn=0362-4331 |eissn=1553-8095 |oclc=1645522|url-status=live }}\n\nWarren received a prime-time speaking slot at the  on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that \"has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered\". According to Warren, \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged.\" Warren said Wall Street CEOs \"wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs\" and that they \"still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them\".\n\n\n\nOn January 6, 2017, in an email to supporters, Warren announced that she would be running for a second term as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, writing, \"The people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. ... This is no time to quit.\"\n\nIn the 2018 election, Warren defeated Republican nominee , 60% to 36%.\n\n\n\n\nWarren is running for a third Senate term. She faces Republican nominee John Deaton, an attorney.\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts, as part of  that had 20 women senators in office, which was the most in Senate history at the time, following . In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the , which oversees the implementation of Dodd–Frank and other regulation of the banking industry. Vice President  swore Warren in on January 3, 2013.\n\nAt Warren's first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, \"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'.\" Videos of Warren's questioning amassed more than one million views in a matter of days. At a March Banking Committee hearing, Warren asked  officials why criminal charges were not brought against  for . Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: \"If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail ... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Warren sent letters to the , the , and the  questioning their decisions that settling would be more fruitful than going to court. Also in May, saying that students should get \"the same great deal that banks get\", Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%.  senator  endorsed her bill, saying: \"The only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn't\".\n\nDuring the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. After the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position created for her. The appointment added to speculation that Warren would run for president in 2016.\n\n, November 2015 (3:28)]]\nIn early 2015, President Obama urged Congress to approve the , a proposed  agreement between the United States and 11 Asian and South American countries. Warren criticized the TPP, arguing that the dispute resolution mechanism in the agreement and labor protections for American workers therein were insufficient; her objections were in turn criticized by Obama.\n\nSaying \"despite the progress we've made since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy\", in July 2015 Warren, , , and  reintroduced the 21st Century , a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation was intended to reduce the American taxpayer's risk in the financial system and the likelihood of future financial crises.\n\nIn a September 20, 2016, hearing, Warren called on  CEO  to resign, adding that he should be \"criminally investigated\" over Wells Fargo's  without the customers' consent.\n\nIn December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the , which '''' called \"a high-profile perch on one of the chamber's most powerful committees\" that would \"fuel speculation about a possible 2020 bid for president\".\n\nDuring the debate on Senator 's nomination for  in February 2017, Warren quoted a letter  had written Senator  in 1986 when Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship. King wrote, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.\" Senate Republicans voted that by reading the letter from King, Warren had violated , which prohibits impugning another senator's character.

She called for major changes in government:\n\n\n\nFollowing her candidacy announcement, Warren became known for the number and depth of her policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, several proposals inspired by opposition to President Trump, a plan to utilize , and plans to address  addiction. One of her signature plans was a , dubbed the \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax\", on fortunes over $50 million. Warren was credited with popularizing the idea of a wealth tax with Americans, leading competitor Bernie Sanders to release a wealth tax plan. \"I have a plan for that\" began to develop as a catchphrase for Warren's campaign, and her campaign store began selling merchandise displaying the phrase.\n\nAfter the ninth debate of the 2020 Democratic primaries, on February 19, Warren received considerable media coverage for her scolding of fellow candidate .

In October 2019, Warren announced that her campaign would not accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at banks, large tech companies, private equity firms, or hedge funds, in addition to her previous refusal to accept donations of over $200 from fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Warren's campaign raised $24.6 million, just less than the $25.3 million Sanders's campaign raised and well ahead of Joe Biden, the front-runner in the polls, who raised $15.2 million.

She expressed concerns over what she says were Trump's conflicts of interest. The , written by Warren, was first read in the Senate in January 2017. Warren was highly critical of Trump's immigration policies. In 2018, she called for abolishing  (ICE).\n\nWarren has criticized U.S. involvement in the  in support of Yemen's government against the . In January 2019, Warren criticized Trump's decision to withdraw  and . She agreed that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Syria and Afghanistan but said such withdrawals should be part of a \"coordinated\" plan formed with U.S. allies.\n\nIn April 2019, after reading the , Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying, \"The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.\"\n\nAfter the June 24, 2022,  in which the Supreme Court overturned '''', Warren wrote a ''New York Times'' op-ed requesting that President Biden unblock \"critical resources and authority that states and the federal government can use to meet the surge in demand for reproductive health services\".\n\nIn 2022, Warren voted to advance legislation to codify same-sex marriage into federal law by voting for the .\n\nOn March 13, 2023, Warren presented a detailed analysis of the  on March 10, 2023, and provided possible solutions to avoid further bank failures, in ''''.\n\nWarren supports a two-state solution to the . In March 2024, she was one of 19 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Biden administration urging the U.S. to recognize a \"nonmilitarized\"  after the war in Gaza.\n\n\nAccording to Warren and her brothers, older family members told them during their childhood that they had some  ancestry. In 2012, she said that \"being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born\". In 1984, Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified herself as . Warren is not a part of any native tribes and does not hold any tribal citizenship.\n\nDuring Warren's first Senate race in 2012, her opponent, , speculated that she had  to gain advantage on the employment market and used Warren's ancestry in several attack ads. Warren has denied that her alleged heritage gave her any advantages in her schooling or her career. Several colleagues and employers (including Harvard) have said her reported ethnic status played no role in her hiring. From 1995 to 2004, her employer, Harvard Law School, listed her as a Native American in its federal affirmative action forms; Warren later said she was unaware of this.\n\n''The Washington Post'' reported that in 1986, Warren identified her race as \"American Indian\" on a  write-in form used for statistical information gathering, but added that there was \"no indication it was used for professional advancement\". A 2018 '''' investigation found that her reported ethnicity played no role in her rise in the academic legal profession, and concluded there was \"clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools\", and that \"Warren was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed her\". In February 2019, Warren apologized for having identified as Native American.\n\nThroughout his presidency, former president  mocked Warren for her assertions of Native American ancestry, and pejoratively called her \"\". At a July 2018 Montana rally, he promised that if he debated Warren, he would pay $1 million to her favorite charity if she took a  and \"it shows you're an Indian\". In October 2018, Warren released an analysis of a DNA test by geneticist  that found her ancestry to be mostly European but \"strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor\", likely \"in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago\". According to ''The Boston Globe'', this puts Warren somewhere between 1/64 and 1/1024 (0.09% to 1.5%) Native American. Other geneticists, while not disputing the test's validity, found the underlying science \"flawed\" due to the lack of  in the database. Geneticists  and Matthew Anderson called the interpretation of the test \"problematic\", citing, among other reasons, \"Warren's motives, and the genetic variants informing the comparison\". They added: \"because Bustamante used Indigenous individuals from Central and South America as a reference group to compare Warren's DNA, we believe he should have stated only that Warren potentially had an 'Indigenous' ancestor 6-10 generations ago, not conclusively a 'Native American' one. The distinction might seem hypercritical to most, but to the sovereign tribal nations of the United States it's an important one.\"\n\nAfter publicizing Bustamante's interpretation of the test, Warren asked Trump to donate the money to the . Trump responded: \"I didn't say that. I think you better read it again\". The  criticized Warren, saying, \"Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong.\" According to '''', \"Warren's past claims of American Indian ancestry garnered fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle\", with \"tribal leaders calling out Warren for claiming a heritage she did not culturally belong to.\"\n\nDuring a January 2019 public appearance in , Warren was asked by an attendee, \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald more fodder to be a bully?\" She responded in part, \"I am not a ; I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\" She later privately contacted leadership of the Cherokee Nation to apologize \"for furthering confusion over issues of tribal sovereignty and citizenship and for any harm her announcement caused\". Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said that Warren understands \"that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests\". Warren apologized again in August 2019 before a Native American Forum in Iowa.\n\nIn February 2019, Warren received a standing ovation during a surprise visit to a Native American conference, where she was introduced by freshman Representative  (D-), one of the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress. Haaland endorsed Warren for president in July 2019, calling her \"a great partner for \".\n\n\n Gala]]\n\nIn 2009, ''The Boston Globe'' named Warren the Bostonian of the Year, and the  honored her with the  Award. '''' has repeatedly named Warren one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America, and in 2010 named her one of the 40 most influential attorneys of the decade. Also in 2009, Warren became the first professor in Harvard's history to win the law school's Sacks–Freund Teaching Award for a second time. In 2011, she delivered the commencement address at , her alma mater, and received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and membership in the . In 2011, Warren was inducted into the . In January 2012, '''' magazine named her one of the \"top 20 U.S. progressives\". Warren was named one of 's  in 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the  theme in the United States was \"Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\", referring to McConnell's remark about Warren.\n\n\n* Warren has appeared in the s '''' (2007), 's '''' (2009), '''' (2011), and '''' (2013).\n* In 2017,  played Warren on ''''.

In his 2024 book ''The Rebels: Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the Struggle for a New American Politics'', Joshua Green cites Warren as a major figure in shaping the Democratic Party's embrace of more leftward politics in the dozen years after the Great Recession. Green considers Warren to have demonstrated \"a new way\" approach in national politics, whereby politicians engage in \"big, loud, messy fights that offered moral clarity and galvanized public sentiment behind a position.\" He credited this approach for enabling Warren to \"take on her own party\". Warren herself had previously boasted about being a \"thorn\" to the Obama administration, taking pride in her willingness to be combative with the administration's major economic officials and occasionally voice public disagreement with Obama's positions.\n\nFellow journalist  concurred with Green's analysis that Warren (as well as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio–Cortez) had \"helped lead an economic 'backlash' to the 2008 financial crisis that pulled the [Democratic] party leftward.\" After the 2016 election of Donald Trump placed the national Democratic Party in a political wilderness as both the opposition to the president and the minority party in both chambers of the Congress, many commenters saw Warren as one of the de facto leading figures in a party that lacked a clear singular post-Obama leader.\n\nColumnists such as Perry Bacon Jr. of ''The Washington Post'' have written that ideas Warren promoted during her presidential campaign have had some influence on the Biden administration's agenda. In February 2021, Jeff Bridgood observed that the administration appeared more receptive to Warren's input than the Obama administration had been, reflecting how the party had become more in line with her political philosophy than it had been when she first rose to political prominence. During the Biden administration, Warren has continued to be a prominent voice within her party.\n\n\nWarren has mentored several people who have gone on to hold notable political office. U.S. Representative , a former law student of hers, is considered her protégée. Porter co-chaired Warren's presidential campaign. Another of Warren's political protégées is  (), who was a law student of hers and worked on her 2012 Senate campaign before running for Boston City Council herself in 2013.   also got his start in politics working on Warren's 2012 campaign. During his law school studies, former U.S. Representative  considered Warren a mentor.  president  has also been described as a Warren protégée and served as senior counsel to Warren's presidential campaign before running for city council. \n\n\nWarren strongly believes that \"personnel is policy\": that the policy of a presidency is shaped by who a president appoints to their administration. She has influenced President Obama, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and President Biden on the matter of staffing presidential administrations.\n\n\nWarren discreetly engaged in an effort to shape the administration Hillary Clinton would lead if she won the 2016 election. In his 2024 book, Stern noted that after Warren (bullish on her own 2016 prospects of winning a presidential election) had declined grassroots efforts to draft her into a candidacy. Recognizing that Clinton stood of becoming the party's nominee, Warren quietly worked to influence how she might staff an administration.\n\nIn 2019, Alex Thompson reported in ''Politico'' on Warren's efforts ahead of the 2016 election to pressure Clinton on potential appointees. Thompson described Warren's theory on political power as \"combining tough, often hyperbolic rhetoric to create leverage with quieter, hands-on, person-to-person outreach.\" He reported that, beginning in December 2014, Warren had discreetly \"pressed Clinton to commit to not appointing Wall Street-friendly people to her administration, as Warren felt Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had done.\" He described this effort as a \n\n\n\nThompson reported that Warren had also \"sent Clinton a list of people she wanted the campaign team to consult on economic policy in order to broaden their horizons\", all of whom had been \"critical of the Obama administration's response to the financial crisis, as Warren had.\" Thompson reported that Clinton and her political advisors gave great deference to Warren's advice, both out of concern that Warren might otherwise challenge Clinton in the primary, but also due to \"Warren’s credibility among progressives and her willingness to use her  to condemn members of her own party.\"\n\n\nWarren has had notable success in lobbying President Biden on certain appointments in his administration. A number of Warren's acolytes have served in the Biden administration, including  (a former economic policy advisor to Warren) and  (a former senate and campaign policy advisor to Warren on national security). Within the first three weeks of his presidency, Biden had already named four of Warren's campaign and Senate staffers to positions in his administration, among other Warren allies and protégés. In March 2021, Kara Voght of '''' wrote, \"Warren has been a private but constant voice to the Biden administration on personnel decisions.\" That same month, Zachary Warmbrodt of '''' wrote: \n\n}}\n\n\nIn 2004, Warren and her daughter, , wrote ''''. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as s, , , and  had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.\n\nIn an article in ''The New York Times'',  said of the book:\n\n }}\n\nIn 2005, Warren and  published a study on  and s that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem.

She was raised in the Merrimack Valley and resides in . Nguyen graduated from Methuen High School and enrolled at  as a first-generation college student. Before deciding to study law, Nguyen believed she wanted to study medicine and become a pediatrician. Her love for children led her to become involved with the Jumpstart program providing education to help underprivileged children develop literacy skills at a young age. However, her involvement with Jumpstart led Tram to realize that she wanted to continue to help families such as these and preferred to make change through policy, not medicine.

Cahill is second generation Irish. His parents Eamon Cahill, a bricklayer and Eileen Cahill (nee O’Shaughnessy) a homemaker emigrated from Thurles, Co.Tipperary in the 1930s.\n\n\nCahill's first attempt to be elected to political office came in 1981, when he unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the  City Council. He ran again in 1987, at the age of 29, and was elected, where he served until 2003. He was reelected seven times and served as the chair of the finance committee.\n\nIn 1996, Cahill was elected as Norfolk County treasurer and served until 2002, when he began his campaign for state treasurer. In the 2002 Democratic primary, Cahill won a four-way race that included another candidate with the same surname, , and was elected state Treasurer in the general election.\n\nDuring Cahill's tenure as treasurer, the Massachusetts Lottery raised $7.2 billion.  Much of the money went to cities and towns in the form of local aid.\n\nOn July 7, 2009, ''The Boston Globe'' reported that Cahill was planning to leave the Democratic Party. On September 9, 2009, Cahill announced that he would run in the  as an independent.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his tenure as state Treasurer, Cahill was Chairman of the seven-member Board of Directors. He filed the legislation to reform the School Building Assistance Program  (SBA) in 2004. He worked with Governor  and the legislature to pass that legislation.\n\nPrior to the reform, Governor Romney said the SBA could be \"the next Big Dig.\"  As chair of the newly authorized  (MSBA) that received the prior SBA's responsibilities and debts, Cahill lead the initial years of the entity's activities. The MSBA has received praise from members of both parties for its fiscal management and effectiveness.\n\n\nAs Treasurer, Cahill served as Chairman of the nine-member Pension Reserves Investment Management (PRIM) Board, which is charged with the general supervision of the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund.\n\n\nCahill was Chairman of the five-member Lottery Commission, which was established by the Legislature in 1971 to provide local aid to Massachusetts cities and towns, as well as the state Arts Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council.\n\nAs of April 24, 2010,  FY10 sales are about $3.636 billion while FY09 sales during same period were $3.645 billion, a dropoff of 0.25 percent from year to year. The state's lottery will post record profits that year - $903 million - while lottery sales stayed even.  Cities and towns expect to receive an extra $44 million from lottery revenue.  Cahill has argued that the increased revenues are the product of spending cuts and new games. Since taking office in 2003, the Lottery has returned $7.3 billion in Local Aid to cities and towns.\n\n\nCahill is a vocal critic of the state's , often called \"Romneycare\" for Governor Mitt Romney, who signed the legislation into law, and which Cahill has called \"a fiscal train wreck\" that has \"blown a hole in the Commonwealth's budget.\"  While projected to cost the taxpayers only $88 million in 2006, the actual cost of the Bay State's healthcare system was over $4 billion.\n\n\n\n\nCahill ran as an independent for the office of , with former State Representative Paul Loscocco (R) as his running mate. He ran against incumbent Governor  (D) and the former Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare CEO  (R).\n\nSome pre-election polls showed that Cahill would draw votes from both Patrick and Baker equally, which showed his moderate and centrist position in the race. A '''' poll, published on September 26, 2010, showed Cahill to be drawing more votes from Patrick than from Baker.\n\nOn October 1, 2010, Loscocco announced he was withdrawing from the race for lieutenant governor and was endorsing Baker although it was too late to remove his name from the ballot as Cahill's running mate. Speculation immediately began over Loscocco's motives and the role of the Baker camp in the decision in which Baker joined Loscocco for the announcement.\n\nCahill filed a lawsuit that alleged that Loscocco had colluded with former Cahill Republican staffers to orchestrate his abandonment and e-mails exchanged between Loscocco's top advisor. The lawsuit sought to prevent the staffers from sharing proprietary information with the Baker campaign.\n\nCahill received 8% of the vote at the November 2, 2010 general election.\n\n\nAfter leaving the office of treasurer, Cahill became a securities broker in November 2011 with Compass Securities Corporation of Braintree, Massachusetts. Cahill ended his employment with Compass on March 7, 2017, shortly after he had paid off his $100,000 civil fine and completed his probationary period from a 2013 settlement with Massachusetts Attorney General  (see next section).\n\nIn July, 2017, Cahill began as the president and executive director of the Quincy Chamber of Commerce.  At the time, he stated that he had no interest in running for public office again.\n\n\nAdam Meldrum, Cahill's campaign manager during his 2010 campaign for governor, alleged that Cahill colluded with the Massachusetts Lottery, which is overseen by the state treasurer's office, to run an ad favorable to him during the campaign. The ad, paid for by the Commonwealth, described the Massachusetts Lottery \"the most successful state lottery America\" and \"consistently well-managed,\" which echoed themes from Cahill's gubernatorial campaign. Both Cahill and Massachusetts Lottery Director Mark Cavanagh denied the allegations. On October 18, e-mails released in conjunction with Cahill's lawsuit appeared to reveal that the campaign attempted to have the Lottery air a series of ads that praised the lottery's management. In the e-mails, Cahill's campaign media strategist Dane Strother told Meldrum to \"Get the Lottery immediately cutting a spot and get it up...Needs to focus on the Lottery being the best in the country and above reproach.\" Two days later, Cahill's senior adviser Scott Campbell wrote, \"I think the first thing is to figure out what/where/how we want to do this .. with Lottery people.\"\n\nOn April 2, 2012, Cahill was indicted by a  on charges that he used $1.65 million in Massachusetts State Lottery advertising to aid his campaign for governor in 2010. On December 12, 2012, a mistrial was declared in the corruption case after the jury failed to reach a verdict on two counts of conspiracy. Attorney General  said that she would review her options before she decided whether to pursue another trial.\n\nOn March 1, 2013, Cahill agreed to pay a $100,000 civil fine in exchange for the prosecution dropping its criminal corruption case against him.\n\nIn February 2017, Cahill posted to his FINRA Broker Check record that the \"monetary fine (sic) paid in full as of 1/27/2017 and on 2/1/2017 the court dismissed the case; all four charges were dismissed after the completion of the probation period.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n* 2006 campaign contributions\n* profile\n* Investment Banker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The result of the election was considered too close to call by most news outlets, since the candidates were separated by only 0.2 percent, and a recount was expected.

In 2017, three teachers with the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers worked full-time in that role.

He also served as the Commonwealth's 68th  from 1991 to 1999, as well as in the Massachusetts  and  from 1977 to 1991.\n\nWhen  resigned in 1997 after being nominated for , Cellucci became acting governor.  He then was elected governor in 1998, and served until 2001, when he resigned to become the U.S. Ambassador to Canada under President , a post he held until 2005.\n\n\n\n\nCellucci was born in , into a political family, the son of Priscilla M. (née Rose) and Argeo R. Cellucci Jr. His father was of Italian descent from the small  village of , and his mother was of Irish ancestry.\n\nHe graduated from ,  (BA, 1970), and  (JD, 1973). He and his wife Jan were married in 1972. They had two daughters, Kate and Anne (who is married to -born Canadian hockey player ). He served in the  from 1970 to 1978, reaching the rank of .\n\nHe was a , and held the distinction of never losing an election over his three decades in elected office in overwhelmingly Democratic Massachusetts.  Cellucci was first elected to public office as a member of the Hudson Charter Commission in 1970. Subsequently, he was elected to the Hudson Board of Selectmen, on which he served from 1971 to 1977. In 1976, he was elected to the  where he served until 1985. He then became a member of the , serving from 1985 to 1991. From 1991 to 1999 he was .\n\n\n\n\nCellucci became the Governor of Massachusetts in 1997 upon the resignation of . On November 3, 1998, Paul Cellucci was elected as governor, narrowly defeating Democratic attorney general .  He had successfully fought off a challenge from State Treasurer  in the September primary.  He was sworn in as the 69th Governor of Massachusetts on January 7, 1999.\n\nCellucci was a fiscally conservative, anti-tax governor who had the ability to work in a bipartisan fashion with an overwhelmingly Democratic State Legislature.  In 2001, the  , in its fifth biennial fiscal policy report card, gave Cellucci an \"A\" grade and said he \"earned the distinction of having the best record of reducing taxes and restraining spending growth\" among the nation's 50 governors.  Governor Cellucci spearheaded the statewide initiative to reduce the state income tax from 5.95% to 5%, which was approved 59% to 41% by the voters of Massachusetts in November 2000.\n\nCellucci was also successful in maintaining the state's high education standards for most students. Those standards, which required students to pass exams in basic Math and English to receive a high school diploma, were a major piece of the Education Reform Act of 1993 and were phased in over time. The teachers unions wanted to weaken the standards just as they were about to take effect, but Cellucci worked with Speaker of the House Thomas Finneran and Senate President Thomas Birmingham, both Democrats, to hold the line on this issue.\n\nThe standards have remained in effect and in its June 4, 2007 report card on \"No Child Left Behind,\" ''Time'' magazine found that Massachusetts students score the best on the federal tests. However, in 2000, Cellucci signed a budget bill that lowered the state's longstanding \"maximum feasible development\" standard for special education to the federal mandate of a \"free and appropriate public education,\" which set a much lower standard for the provision of special education to students with disabilities. The latter standard remains in effect.\n\nThe biggest controversy during Cellucci's tenure was the huge cost overruns on the \"\" – an enormous project to replace the elevated central artery highway in Boston with a tunnel.  Cellucci removed the project manager, , and put his Secretary of Administration and Finance, , in charge of the project.\n\nCellucci, in 1998, signed into law one of the toughest gun control measures in the United States. He was also known to take a conservative approach to crime. He supported '''' and abortion rights. For this reason,  disinvited Cellucci from speaking at a commencement ceremony of Hudson Catholic High School, Cellucci's alma mater.\n\nIn 2000, Cellucci proposed an amendment to the Massachusetts constitution to strip felons of the right to vote. The amendment was approved in a referendum.\n\nCellucci appointed many women to high ranking positions, including Margaret H. Marshall as the first female Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Her appointment marked the first time a woman headed a branch of government in Massachusetts history.\n\n\nOn April 10, 2001, Cellucci resigned, after  nominated, and the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment as  to . He was succeeded by , who became the first woman in Massachusetts history to occupy the governor's office.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 17, 2001, at the Citadel in , Cellucci presented his credentials as the 27th  to  .\n\nHis four-year tenure would be a historical and controversial period in the United States – Canadian relations. On September 14, 2001, three days after the terrorist attacks on United States soil, Ambassador Cellucci thanked Canada for its overwhelming support and sympathy, including their role in , at a memorial in front of 100,000&nbsp;people on  in . He would mention the operation and the memorial service quite often during the days and months that followed the  in the United States. The months and years that followed the attacks would see extraordinary cooperation between the United States and Canada on the , on their law enforcement and intelligence agencies to stop terrorist attacks in North America, and in  in the war against the Taliban.\n\nOn March 25, 2003, at a speech to the Economic Club of Toronto, Cellucci faced controversy when he criticized Canadian opposition to the U.S.-led . He argued that America was waging war for its own security, and that the United States would \"never hesitate\" to support Canada if it faced a security threat.  This wording was considered especially unfortunate by some since the United States did in fact delay years before joining the British Empire in both  and  in Europe.  '''' reported Cellucci's remarks under the front-page headline \"U.S. rebukes Canada\" and Canadian nationalist  called him \"ill-mannered, obnoxious, [and] arrogant\".\n\nHe also expressed support for Canada joining the U.S.  program, and for urging Canada to increase defense spending. These statements, frequently perceived as implied trade threats, caused Cellucci to be sarcastically christened \"the U.S. ambassador-turned-\" by former  cabinet minister and Foreign Minister  in an opinion piece titled \"Say no to missile defence\" published on April 29, 2003 in ''''. Canada has since declined to participate in the U.S. missile defense program.\n\nWhile the frosty relations were due to the Canadian government's opposition to President Bush's policies, there has also been criticism of the former   for tolerating anti-American outbursts from his aide, while Chrétien's successor  attempted to paint his opponent,  leader , as pro-American during the .\n\nCellucci officially resigned his ambassadorship on March 17, 2005. A humorous indication of Canadian opinion of Cellucci's tenure was provided by  satirist , who promoted on his program, '''', a fictitious \"Paul Cellucci Farewell Special\" entitled \"Don't Let the Door Hit You on the Ass\".\n\n\n\n ]]\nOn March 18, 2005, the day after Cellucci had resigned from his ambassadorship,  announced they had hired Cellucci. Magna chairman  said Cellucci's role would be to help reform U.S. horse racing regulations. In September 2005, Cellucci published a book called ''Unquiet Diplomacy'', a  of his time as ambassador. In the book, he praised Canada as \"a truly great nation\", but also had some criticism for the governments of former Prime Ministers  and .\n\nThe same month, shortly after an interview where  to   stirred controversy over comments he made on the case of , Cellucci gave an interview in which explained his position on the Arar case. While he was Ambassador, Cellucci had declined to participate into the inquiry into the Americans' \"\" of Arar to Syria and the possible role of Canadian officials in the rendition, being consistent with the Bush administration's position that nothing improper had been done. Cellucci's comments in the 2005 interview were seen as a rebuke to Wilkins.\n\nCellucci acknowledged, \"Part of the unfairness was that we took a Canadian citizen, shipped him to a third country without consulting with Canada,\" apparently exonerating Canadian officials. Cellucci did point out that as a result of the Canadian Government's protest about Arar, the United States and Canada exchanged letters, in which each undertook to notify the other country if either government was going to remove, involuntarily, a National of the other country to a third country. While each country retains all rights to do what is in its security interests, Cellucci believed that as a practical matter, this makes it highly unlikely that anything like the Arar situation will happen again.\n\nThe same interview revealed that Cellucci, as a private citizen, also had second thoughts about the stance he had taken as ambassador on the . During the lead-up to the invasion, Cellucci had put pressure on Canada to join in the invasion, based on the American and UK assertions that Saddam's administration possessed a dangerous arsenal of . But in 2005 Cellucci acknowledged: \"We're not always right, and on that particular one it looks like we weren't right, although we know at some point in the past he did have these weapons.\"\n\nCellucci left Magna International in the fall of 2006 and joined the Boston office of the law firm of , where he held the title of Special Counsel. In 2008, Cellucci said that, after thirty-five years in public service, he had no intention of seeking further office, and that, while he had no interest in serving as vice president, he did not exclusively rule it out. He supported 's candidacy for president in 2008.\n\nIn 2013, Cellucci was a signatory to an ''amicus curiae'' brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the '''' case.\n\nAlso in 2013, Cellucci helped free a U.S. citizen (the younger brother of sports broadcaster ) who was imprisoned by the Venezuelan government.\n\n\nIn January 2011, Cellucci announced he had been diagnosed with  (ALS), also known as 's disease, and that it was progressing relatively slowly.\n\nCellucci responded to his diagnosis by leading an effort to raise $10 million for research at the  (UMMS) into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cellucci joined UMMS Chancellor Michael F. Collins and UMMS neurologist Dr. Robert H. Brown Jr., who was leading Cellucci's treatment, before a Boston Red Sox game on May 19, 2011 at Fenway Park to announce the fundraising campaign. \"I'm going to be talking to people from my old political network and I hope I can get some support there,\" Cellucci said. \"We have a lot of people through the social network and we can really reach out across this country.\"\n\nOn March 15, 2012,  announced it was donating $500,000 to the UMass ALS Champion Fund, a substantial part of the $1.3 million that the fund raised in its first year.\n\nCellucci died of complications from his disease on June 8, 2013. He was 65.  Governor  released a statement saying that \"Massachusetts lost a favored son and devoted public servant today. A lawyer, legislator, governor and diplomat, Paul Cellucci was also a kind man and a friend.\" Former governor  said \"Paul Cellucci was simply one of the finest human beings I have ever met. I happened to know him in the realm of politics and government, but anyone who knew him in any other arena would have found the same man: a person of rock-hard integrity, keen intelligence, considerable humor, abundant compassion, and deep devotion to family and country. We are all immensely impoverished by his loss.\" Former governor  wrote a message on  saying \" and I are saddened by the loss of our friend Gov. Paul Cellucci. Our hearts and prayers are with Jan and the Cellucci family.\" \"I had the chance to work with Ambassador Cellucci when I was a minister in the province of . I can attest to the fact he was a great friend to Canada, and we are grateful for his contributions to the bilateral relationship, both as ambassador and as governor of Massachusetts,\" said  .\n\nA memorial was dedicated to Cellucci on September 20, 2015 in his hometown of Hudson, Massachusetts by the Hudson Rotary Club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*, , Policy Analysis no. 391, February 12, 2001\n*, '''', February 13, 2001\n*, '''', January 4, 2005\n*, '''', March 18, 2005\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n}}\n}}\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Thompson during his political career, he served as the 70th  from 1947 to 1948 and was elected as the first  in 1946.\n\n\nThompson was born in , to Henry Jackson Thompson and his wife Eva Edenfield Thompson. He was the youngest of seven children and his father died just after his first birthday. His father was a sharecropper. Thompson grew up in poverty, but through hard work and determination, he was able to leave the farm to pursue a higher education. He helped pay his way through college by working various jobs, including student teaching and the selling of bibles door to door. He graduated from  in 1926, then earned a  (M.A.) from the  in 1935. He also earned all of the credits for a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia, but because his adviser died, he never defended his dissertation. Following his college career, Thompson worked in education, first as a teacher and coach, a principal, a district superintendent, moving all the way up to assistant school superintendent for the state. Thompson was a supporter of Governor  and was hired as his Executive Secretary. Arnall then appointed him to the position of State Revenue Commissioner in 1945.\n\n\nMelvin Ernest Thompson married Dora Anne Newton, from Millen, Georgia, in 1926, and had one child, Melvin E. Thompson Jr., Melvin E. Thompson Jr. married Mary Bathsheba Carter and they had four children, Marianne Thea, Tarkenton Newton, Carter Maria and Melvin E. the 3rd. Melvin Jr. had a fifth child with his second wife Laura Mitchell, Charles Thompson.\n\n\n\nIn 1946, Thompson ran for the newly created position of . He won the election and became Georgia's first Lieutenant Governor. Following Thompson's election, Governor-elect  died on December 21, 1946, and the  was vague on who would be sworn in as governor, causing the . Thompson felt that as the Lieutenant Governor-elect, he should become the Governor. But the state legislature was controlled by Talmadge supporters. They invoked a clause in the Georgia state constitution which allowed for the legislature to pick between the second- and third-place candidates. The people who finished second and third were two write-in candidates, James V. Carmichael and Eugene's son, . The legislature selected Herman Talmadge to become the governor. He would hold that position temporarily.\n\n\n\nThompson and Arnall both claimed the office of governor. Arnall later renounced his claim to support Thompson. The  ruled that Thompson was the legitimate governor and that the legislature had violated the state constitution by selecting Talmadge. Thompson's numerous achievements as the  include much needed improvements to highway infrastructure, public education, and the purchase of , a beach retreat for the average Georgian. He was able to raise the salary of teachers, provide free books to students, and extend high school to the 12th grade. His purchase of Jekyll Island for $675,000.00 is still considered to be one of the greatest real estate purchases made in U.S. history. Thompson was able to achieve many things during his shortened term, with very limited cooperation from the state legislature, and without raising taxes on the citizens of Georgia.\n\n\nThompson unsuccessfully opposed Talmadge three additional times, twice in gubernatorial elections in 1950 and 1954 and finally in 1956 for one of Georgia's  seats.

All amendments failed to pass a large majority, with the 2021 vote failing by a vote of 41-117. \n\nIn 2022, a non-binding ballot question organized by her later political opponent was presented to voters in her district, asking whether their representative should support changes to House rules to make each legislator's committee vote available on the Legislature's website. 94.2% of voters in Decker's district supported the measure.\n\nIn 2024, Decker said that committee votes \"should be online\".\n\n\nIn 2020, the  (DCR) expanded  along  in Cambridge to include Saturdays.

At the time of his birth, his mother was residing in the  borough of . Although Camejo spent most of his early childhood in Venezuela, he was a \"natural born citizen\" of the United States and therefore constitutionally eligible for the U.S. Presidency later in life.\n\nHis parents, Elvia Guanche and , divorced when their son was seven.

As a branch organizer, he sought to reorient the SWP towards the student movement.\n\n\nCamejo's first political campaign on behalf of the SWP came in 1967 when as a 27-year old he ran for mayor . He was the SWP's nominee for  and won 90,986 votes, or 0.1%.\n\nWhile a member of the Socialist Workers Party, Camejo wrote ''Racism, Revolution, Reaction, 1861-1877. The Rise and Fall of Radical Reconstruction,'' published by the party's publishing house, . He also met with .\n\nThe SWP's policy was to turn its members into \"proletarians\" by having them take jobs in factories and advocate for a worker-based class struggle. By 1980, Camejo came to disagree with this policy in favor of , and the SWP expelled him. He led the third dissident group of the SWP and formed North Star Network in 1983.\n\nIn 1992 Camejo committed $20,000 of his own money toward establishing the Progressive Alliance of Alameda County, an organizational effort that did not sustain itself.\n\nCamejo was quoted in 2002 as claiming that he was a watermelongreen on the outside but red on the inside.\n\nHowever, in January 2004 Camejo initiated the  which compares , to avocados. ''\"An avocado is Green on the outside and Green on the inside.\"''\n\nJust over a month after the 2004 election, Camejo was elected as one of California's delegates to the National Committee of the Green Party and established the GDI, \"Greens for Democracy and Independence,\" a cadre group within the larger Green Party of  California that ran candidates for local Green County Councils. At the 2005 Green Party National Convention, Camejo stated that he would not be a candidate for President in 2008.\n\nCamejo wrote a number of articles concerning the divisions evident in the  in the aftermath of the turbulent 2004 national convention, continuing the themes of the  in opposing attempts to \"cozy up\" to the newly formed .\n\nIn August 2008 he attended the convention of the  in order to personally endorse Nader's presidential candidacy.\n\n\n\nCamejo ran for Governor of California three times, against incumbent governors  and  in 2002 and 2006, and in the 2003 recall election in which Schwarzenegger replaced Davis as governor.\n\n\nIn , Camejo ran uncontested in the California Green Party gubernatorial primary. In the general election, he ran as part of the first full slate of Green candidates for all seven of California's partisan constitutional offices. Camejo lost the election to Governor , but he polled 393,036 votes, for 5.3% of the vote, the largest vote total for a  in the California governor's race since , when Henry R. Schmidt of the  polled 7.1%. Because the San Francisco Green Party endorsed him, Camejo earned more votes in  than  gubernatorial nominee , a rarity in third-party politics. \n\n\nIn 2003, he was the endorsed  candidate for governor (although several other Greens appeared on the ballot) in an unprecedented  election against , in which he polled , coming in fourth in a field of 135 certified candidates. In a strange preview of the divisions about to erupt on the left in the following year, Camejo first cooperated with, and then competed with, fellow recall candidate .\n\n\n\t\nIn , Camejo made his third bid for Governor of California against incumbent  and Democratic Party nominee . Camejo received 193,553 votes, or 2.3% of the popular vote.\n\n criticized Camejo for \"lending his support to the right-wing effort to depose California governor \" by recall in 2004. However, the  state convention easily voted to endorse Camejo as a recall replacement candidate.\n\n\nCamejo was submitted as a candidate in the Green Party of California's March 2, 2004, Presidential Preference Primary. Before the primary, he made it known that he was not planning to run for president and that any delegates pledged to him would not be committed to vote for him after the first round. The former gubernatorial candidate received 33,753 votes (75.9%) of the Green Party membership's support in California, and 72.7% of the votes in all Green Party primary elections.\n\nIn June 2004, Camejo campaigned for the vice-presidential spot beside two-time Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader as independents (i.e. Nader never actually joined the Green Party), running against whoever the Green Party nominee might be. They received the endorsement of the , which gave them ballot access in several states they would not otherwise have. With votes for Nader added in, the Nader/Camejo ticket had what appeared to be an insurmountable 83% of Green voters behind their candidacies going into the Green Party National Convention in Milwaukee. However many delegates were alienated by non-Green Party member Ralph Nader's wanting the party's hard-won ballot lines, and by Camejo's maneuver serving as a proxy for Nader in California. After an extremely contentious proceeding the convention nominated Green Party members  and  for the Green Party ticket instead. Rejected by the Greens, Nader and Camejo continued their campaign as independent candidates.\n\nBoth Nader and Camejo asserted the main reason they ran in the 2004 election was because there were no other national candidates demanding an immediate withdrawal of American troops from what they believe is an immoral and unconstitutionally pursued  (though minor party national candidates Green ,  ,  candidate ,  candidate  and  candidate  all strongly opposed the war). More accurately the Nader/Camejo were the only candidates who had a regular voice in the mainstream media arguing for withdrawal, since Ralph Nader was regularly invited to appear on mainstream news, and none of the other candidates received mainstream media coverage.\n\nThe Nader/Camejo ticket came in a very distant third in the election, polling approximately 460,000 votes, or 0.4% of the vote. Camejo's supporters claimed this result vindicated the Nader/Camejo team seeking the Green Party's endorsement (of them as non-Green Party candidates) since Cobb/LaMarche received less than one third that many votes with a total of 119,859 votes (0.1%).  This was a drop of 95% compared to the Green Party's 2000 national ticket of Nader and his running mate .  Camejo supporter's claimed that the difference between these outcomes was made up by Nader/Camejo having four-to-one support compared to Cobb/LaMarche within the Green Party. Camejo's experiences on the 2004 campaign are chronicled in 's book, \"What Was Ralph Nader Thinking?\"\n\nThe Nader/Camejo Campaign cooperated loosely with an effort by the Green Party Cobb/LaMarche and Libertarian Party Badnarik/Campagna campaigns to do hand recounts across the country in states where vulnerable electronic voting machines had been used and anomalous results were questioned. Nader/Camejo undertook a challenge to the results in New Hampshire.\n\n\nCamejo is the author of ''The SRI Advantage: Why Socially Responsible Investing Has Outperformed Financially.''\n\nAt the time of his death, Camejo was engaged in writing ''North Star: A Memoir,'' published in May 2010 by .\n\n\nIn the run-up to the June 6, 2006, primary elections in California, Camejo helped create a cadre group within the larger Green Party of California, the Green IDEA (later known as IDEA PAC), a California  espousing \"Independence, Democracy, Empowerment, and Accountability,\" to support candidates for county councils, the locally elected leadership bodies of the Green Party of California. The IDEA PAC was not raising or spending money as of 2010.\n\n\nCamejo died of  on September 13, 2008, at his home in .

She was hired to help the Daytona Beach News-Journal become one of the first newspapers to transition from typewriters to computerized word processing.\n\nAfter high school, Healey attended  with the help of a scholarship. There, she served as the membership secretary of the Harvard Republicans Club and was involved in theater. Healey graduated from Harvard in 1982 with an A.B. in government.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard, Healey was awarded a scholarship by  and received a Ph.D. in political science and law from  in  in 1991. While in Dublin, she met fellow  and Harvard alum Sean Healey, whom she married in 1985.\n\nUpon completing her studies at Trinity College, Healey spent 1985 as a visiting researcher in the International and Comparative Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School.\n\n\nIn 1986, Healey joined , based in , where she performed policy research for the U.S. Department of Justice related to child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, gang violence, victim and witness intimidation and the prosecution of drug crimes. Following her time at Abt Associates, Healey served as an adjunct professor in criminal justice the .\n\nHer first foray into politics occurred in 1998, when she ran for state representative in the 6th Essex District – representing her hometown of  – challenging and losing to incumbent Democrat . That same year, Healey was elected the Republican State Committee. She ran against Cahill unsuccessfully again in 2000. \n\nDespite losing her first two elections, Healey became popular among Republicans and was elected chairwoman of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee in 2001, the second woman to head the Massachusetts GOP. Soon after beginning her term as chairwoman, the Massachusetts GOP began courting Mitt Romney – then the president and CEO of the  – to take over acting-governor 's position as the Republican candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. \n\nAfter Swift exited the race, Romney endorsed Healey in her primary race for lieutenant governor against former U.S. Senate candidate and former party chairman , ultimately winning by a thirty-point margin. The Romney-Healey team was successful, and Healey was elected lieutenant governor on November 5, 2002.\n\n\n in 2004]]\n and  in 2004]]\nKerry Murphy Healey was sworn into office as the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts on January 2, 2003. She, along with Governor , opted not to take a salary during their respective four-year terms.\n\nHealey served as the governor's liaison to cities and the Republican party. Upon taking office, Romney and Healey focused on erasing an estimated $600 million budget gap for fiscal year 2003. The state also faced an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion shortfall for fiscal year 2004.\n\n\nIn mid-January 2003, the Massachusetts State Legislature approved expanded budget-cutting powers for the . As Romney's second-in-command, Healey was the liaison between the local government and the state house, working to reduce the burden of cuts to state aid to municipal governments.\n\nHealey was credited with creating a package of legislative proposals, called the Municipal Relief Act, that reduced expensive and burdensome state mandates, easing the pain of cuts to state aid by about $75 million. The  closed the budget gap and ended fiscal year 2004 with a budget surplus of $700 million. Official state figures showed that Massachusetts ended fiscal year 2005 with a $594.4 million surplus. In 2006, the surplus was officially $720.9 million according to state statistics. Additionally, the administration left the state with a \"rainy day\" stabilization fund with a balance of $2.1 billion.\n\nThese surpluses were attained without breaking the Romney-Healey campaign promise that they would not raise taxes. On the heels of the Municipal Relief Act, Healey headed a bipartisan commission that \"revised management practices for public construction projects designed to save money, increase accountability, improve safety, and give more control to local officials.\" In addition, Healey served as chair of the state's six Regional Competitiveness Councils (RCC), which coordinated and provided recommendations for economic development initiatives across the state.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Healey was known for her hands-on approach to addressing the concerns of cities and towns and her responsiveness to the concerns of local officials. Even with the cuts to the state budget that were made to avoid a budget crisis, local aid increased by 17 percent, and school assistance increased by 7 percent under Healey's watch.\n\nHealey headed the Governor's Commission on Criminal Justice Innovation, a bipartisan, multi-agency group focused on reforming the Massachusetts criminal justice system.\nShe testified in favor of a bill that expanded the definition of crimes considered \"sexually dangerous and allowed dangerous sex offenders to be locked up for life, which was called  in honor of Ally Zapp.\n\nShe recommended and worked to champion programs to supervise and support inmates transitioning back to society, including proposals for mandatory post-release supervision. As lieutenant governor, Healey sought or signed laws that curbed gang violence, enhanced witness safety, expanded the rights of those wrongfully convicted, advanced technology to track sex offenders, curbed substance abuse, strengthened law enforcement's ability to combat opioid abuse, and expanded protection from sex offenders.\n\nIn 2005, Healey supported a proposed ban on same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, in favor of civil unions. Healey has since made her support for same-sex marriage known. As Babson College president, she marched in the 2013 Boston Pride Parade with the school's LGBTQ student organization.\n\nHealey supported the death penalty. She was endorsed by Massachusetts' top gun owners group, but she and Governor Romney worked in a bipartisan manner on gun control, including extending the ban on semi-automatic weapons.\n\nHealey supported immigration status checks during regular police traffic stops and deportation of illegal immigrants. She opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrant students.\n\n\nAfter Governor Romney stated that he would not seek re-election, Healey was dubbed the presumptive Republican nominee for the state's highest elected office. However, Healey faced early competition from within her own party from Republican , the former owner of a chain of convenience stores. The state Republican Party tried to steer Mihos into a race against Senator Ted Kennedy, and also guaranteed him a spot on the ballot in the Republican primary for the governorship, yet Mihos opted to launch his campaign as an independent, making the general election a three-person race;  was the Democratic nominee. Early polls showed Patrick with as much as a 25-point lead over Healey following a competitive Democratic primary, despite most voters backing Healey's support of rolling back the state income tax to five percent, denying in-state tuition rates at state colleges to undocumented immigrants, denying driver's licenses to such residents and requiring photo identification for voting.\n\n\nFollowing the primaries, a TV ad by Healey criticized her gubernatorial rival, Deval Patrick, for serving as the lawyer for the killer of a Florida highway patrol officer gunned down on a rural road. In 1985, Patrick, then a lawyer for the  Legal Defense Fund, worked to reverse the death sentence imposed on killer Carl Ray Songer. \"Her approach is to protect the victims and Deval Patrick's approach is always to protect convicted criminals,\" said Healey's campaign manager Tim O'Brien. Now, under Florida law, Songer is eligible for parole.\n\nThe \"Cop Killer\" campaign ad was featured on a segment of the  about negative campaign ads. The ad was criticized on the air for its lack of information about the case. She criticized Patrick for having written to the Massachusetts Parole Board on behalf of , who proclaims innocence for a 1983 sexual assault, and for corresponding with the inmate. During the heat of the campaign two unidentified men visited LaGuer in prison and allegedly offered him $100,000 if would turn that correspondence over to them.\n\nCritics of Healey's ad argued that it confused the proper role of criminal defence lawyers in the judicial system. Patrick argued that Songer hadn't been sentenced fairly because he wasn't able to present evidence of his good character during the sentencing hearing. \"The federal appeals court agreed with him that [Songer's] death sentence violated the Constitution of the United States,\" said Patrick spokesman Richard Chacon in a statement. Patrick's campaign also pointed out that Healey's running mate, Reed Hillman, lobbied a parole board on behalf of friend James W. Mitchell, who was accused of assaulting a police officer.\n\nPatrick also criticized Healey's campaign for leaking details of the 1993 rape of Patrick's sister by her husband. The Healey's campaign denied any involvement in the leak, and in turn accused Patrick of initiating a \"smear campaign\" over the issue.\n\n\n in 2012]]\nIn the spring of 2007, Healey was a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government's Institute of Politics and was a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Center for Public Leadership for the following fall.\n\nIn 2008, Secretary of State  appointed Healey to the executive committee of the Public-Private Partnership for Justice Reform in  (PPP).

Healey currently serves as president of the board of the Friends of the PPP, a 501(c)(3) non-profit that assists the PPP in achieving its goals in carrying out its work with Afghan judges and lawyers, as well as fundraising.\n\nIn 2009, Healey partnered with Ambassador  to co-chair the Political Parity project. This nonpartisan initiative works to increase the number of women in high-level state and national political offices, through programs including the Media Accountability Project and the Women's Appointment Project. Political Parity has stated that its goal is to \"double the number of women at the highest levels of U.S. government by 2022.\" The project is completely nonpartisan; Political Parity does not endorse, fund, or train potential candidates.\n\nOn August 28, 2009, ''The Boston Globe'' reported that Healey was considering running in the special election for the US Senate seat formerly held by .

From 2007 to 2009 she was secretary of labor in the administration of Governor .\n\n\n\nPrior to Bump leading the , unemployment claims were handled on an antiquated processing system.  She was noted for securing funding and overseeing the roll out of modern telephone and computerized claims systems.  In 2008, Bump announced a regional partnership program that provided new funds to help ex-offenders achieve successful re-entry into communities. The program focused on high crime communities by both providing preventative public safety measures and acting as an economic boost to the regions that received funding.\n\n\n\nShe resigned from Patrick's cabinet in order to enter the race for the position of auditor being vacated by longtime Auditor . She won the primary and the general election and was sworn in as the  on January 19, 2011.\nShortly after taking office, Auditor Bump led sweeping reforms following an independent review of the auditor's office.  The review found the office had workers without college level degrees, inadequate training systems, and unspecified job skills. As part of the reform, 27 employees were terminated and 14 were reassigned, and other employers with proper qualifications were given raises on par with national standards.\nWhen Auditor Bump took over, the office was failing the National State Auditor's Association peer review standards. In two subsequent reviews, it passed with the highest rating. Her audits, investigations, innovations, and studies have identified over $1.3 billion in misused and wasted spending.\n\n\nAuditor Bump's office conducts audits, and studies to promote accountability and transparency, improve performance, and make government work better.

Auditor Bump's team also found that the Department of Children and Families had significant deficiencies, including: incomplete records of the background checks on individuals living in foster homes and insufficient training, management, and technological resources for caseworkers. Her office's audit of MassHealth discovered the organization had over $500 million in wasted funds from 2009 to 2014. This audit now saves Massachusetts $10 million each year. Her office released a report that found that Massachusetts regional schools are being underfunded by $17 million. The Auditor recommended new ways to improve previously held assumptions about public education funding.\n\nIn the 2018 fiscal year, Auditor Bump continued to execute audits on a wide array of Massachusetts services. She determined that parts of the early voting law that went into effect in 2016 constituted an unfunded mandate on local governments. Her conclusion resulted in Massachusetts communities receiving over $1 million in reimbursements. In the same year, her audit of  resulted in the school increasing accountability in terms of its IT inventory and making better use of technology to ensure the university continues to adequately track computers, cell phones, servers, and other equipment.

When Barnstable County asked for Auditor Bump's office to conduct an audit of the county government, she helped the community save hundreds of thousands of dollars. The year also included working with Greenfield Community College to improve its accessibility for students with disabilities and ensuring that the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC) was not awarding individuals greater retirement benefits than they are entitled. Through her duty to improve the integrity of public benefits programs, the auditor and her team identified $16.9 million in public assistance fraud in 2017. Since 1983, the Division of Local Mandates in Massachusetts has helped provide over $354 million in state funding, making the auditor's findings in 2017 higher than average.\n\nIn 2017, auditees reported that they implemented 92% of audit recommendations.\n\nBump received a national award from the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers.\n\n\nThrough her office's audit of the Department of Veterans Services, plans and recommendations were presented for how to better assist veterans moving forward. A 2013 audit of the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) detailed millions of dollars in questionable benefits, inadequate security over blank electronic benefit cards (EBT cards), and a need for improved fraud detection. The audit resulted in the state welfare agency creating an action plan to enhance its program integrity and restore public confidence. Another audit found 1,164 social welfare recipients that were either dead or using a deceased person's Social Security number. Her office \"identified $15.4 million in public benefits fraud during fiscal 2016, primarily in the MassHealth insurance program and food stamps\".\n\n\nAuditor Bump's team worked on solutions for data tools, one of which, coined the \"Rules Based Risk Engine\", won her the National Association of Chief Information Officer's State Recognition Award due to its ability to increase efficiency of the Office of the State Auditor. Her office created an IT audit unit to identify opportunities and potential threats to cyber security. One such audit found many weaknesses in IT security at the Massachusetts Housing Finance Authority.\n\n\nIn addition to her NSAA Excellence in Accountability award, and the National Association of Chief Information Officer's State Recognition award, Auditor Bump has received the Abigail Adams award from the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus, the Einhorn-Gary Award, \"Woman of the Decade\" award from Emerge Massachusetts, and the \"Woman of Justice\" award from Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly.\nShe is currently serving on the boards of the Inspector General Council, Municipal Finance Oversight Board, U.S. Comptroller General's Domestic Working Group, the executive board of the National State Auditor's Association, is a partner of the Women's Suffrage Celebration Coalition of Massachusetts, and is a member of the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus. \nIn October 2016, Bump announced that she will be running for reelection in 2018 and will stay out of the day-to-day operations of two  businesses she inherited from her late husband. Bump hired a new  to run them, and she had no authority in the daily operations of the businesses to avoid state  regulations.\n\n\nBump married Paul McDevitt in 1980. They remained married until McDevitt's death in September 2016.

Unterman stated publicly that there appeared to be \"a direct connection between campaign support from Massage Envy franchisees in exchange for non-action and suppression\" and asked U.S. Attorney  to investigate \"what seems to be a quid pro quo scheme being perpetrated through the secretary of state’s office and the Kemp for governor campaign.\" Kemp said that he did nothing illegal, and refunded the contributions that had been questioned. In response to the accusations, a spokesperson for Kemp's campaign stated that Unterman was \"mentally unstable\" and suggested she \"seek immediate medical attention before she hurts herself or someone else\". These remarks appeared to reference Unterman's history of , about which she has spoken publicly. In response, Unterman said she would not be \"intimidated, blackmailed, belittled, or sexually harassed\" into silence by Kemp's campaign.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2019 legislative session, Unterman was removed as chair of the Health and Human Services Committee by the incoming Senate leader, Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan.

Unterman did not vote on the bill in committee vote, but did so once it arrived on the Senate floor.\n\nSpeaking in favor of an anti-hate crimes bill in 2020, Unterman spoke about her personal experience facing antisemitism following her conversion to Judaism, including having voters explicitly tell her they could not support her because of her religion. She also accused her Republican colleague, , of pressuring her to wear a Christmas sweater as a \"belittling me because of my religion and my faith\" (McCormick replied that Unterman was \"crying wolf like [she] regularly has done when things don’t go her way.\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Since  did not allow three consecutive terms, Governor  was not eligible for re-election. Talmadge, who strongly opposed the New Deal and had delayed its implementation in Georgia, ran for the US Senate and backed Charles D. Redwine for governor. Rivers, who, as Speaker, had strongly supported the New Deal, was his opponent and won with about 60 percent of the vote, the same margin by which Talmadge lost his Senate race.\n\nRivers' first two-year term as governor saw Georgia pass the legislation required to bring New Deal programs into the state, and was widely acclaimed. Rivers created the 7-month school year. Under Rivers' leadership, electrical services were expanded to rural areas of the state.

Roosevelt's advisers warned him of Rivers' KKK connections, and the Georgia governor opted for re-election instead of seeking the Senate seat.\n\nAfter Rivers' re-election in 1938, he ran into problems financing many of his improvement programs. Although the budget was reduced by 25 percent, he was able to convince the legislature to create the Georgia Housing Authority and obtain federal funds to build public housing. During Rivers' second term, there were political scandals and charges of corruption.

This legislation removed or extended the civil SOL so survivors can gain justice and expose the identities of hidden child abusers in the state of Georgia. The Hidden Predator Act was instrumental in leading to the unraveling of one of the largest sex scandals in U.S. sports history: the exposure of , who was later convicted of serial child molestation committed while serving the USA Gymnastics organization.  Rep. Spencer received Voice Today's \"Voice of Gratitude Award\" for his efforts authoring the legislation.\n\nIn 2018, Spencer attempted to amend this 2015 law to strengthen it and provide more time for survivors to file cases, but the bill was weakened by lobbying efforts from the Atlanta Archdiocese of the , the , and other powerful interest groups.

The legislation aimed to amend an existing 1951 Georgia law intended to prohibit members of the   from wearing masks and hoods; it had been constitutionally upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court in ''State v Miller'', 1990 to unmask members of the group.

Spencer supported his charge of potential treason in a letter written to his constituent stating that the  (CAIR) was designated as a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates due to the organization's alleged ties to , an organization which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. Department of State.

A local party leader attributed Spencer's loss in part to his \"antics\" in office. Spencer said \"if he rubbed anyone the wrong way,\" he was doing so by standing up to powerful special interest representing the plight of \"little guy.\"  “My tactics won against them and that is one of the reasons why I stayed in office for eight years, because I effectively beat them at their own game,” said Spencer to the ''Brunswick News.'' In a radio interview with WGIG 1440 AM, Rep. Jason Spencer said that he had often been a target of individuals on the ideological left and establishment politicians for introducing legislation that challenged powerful special interests. He believed such opponents blocked a bill in 2018 to strengthen a law extending civil justice to survivors of child sexual abuse.\n\n\nSpencer was featured in an episode of the  television show '''' that aired on July 22, 2018. The episode showed British comedian , disguised as an Israeli  expert, leading Spencer to drop his pants, imitate a Chinese tourist using  that mixed various , use a  to take an  under a woman's , and repeatedly yell \"\".\n\nGeorgia House Speaker  urged Spencer to resign, saying that he had disgraced himself. Governor  tweeted that Spencer's actions were \"appalling and offensive\". Spencer apologized for what he described as \"this ridiculously ugly episode\" but initially refused to step down, saying that the show's producers had exploited him \"for profit and notoriety\". He said that Baron Cohen and the television crew had falsely promised that he would be able to review and approve the final footage before release. Spencer later announced his resignation on July 24, effective as of July 31.\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* , Georgia House of Representatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Prior to his election to the state senate, Heath served one two-year term in the .\n\n\nBill Heath's first foray into electoral politics was in 2000, when he challenged , the  Speaker of the , for the 18th State House District.  Murphy had held the seat since 1960, and had skated to reelection time and again.\n\nDespite the state Republican Party taking no initial interest in the race, a very competitive race would materialize.  Heath would raise over $60,000, a very competitive sum for a State House race.  Aiding Heath was the ongoing shift in the district's demographics, with the district becoming more suburban and more Republican as 's outer suburbs had begun bleeding into the district; Republican candidates for other offices had frequently won the district Heath would lose the race by 505 votes, a margin of less than two percentage points.\n\nHeath finally defeated Murphy in 2002, in the final race of Murphy's life. The loss was widely attributed to Murphy's role in the 2001 redistricting, which produced contorted districts that confused and angered voters.\n\nUpon taking his seat in the Georgia House, Heath acquired national attention in 2004, when he added a ban on adult women's ability to choose to get genital piercings onto a bill designed to ban the genital mutilation of children. Adult men would still have been allowed to choose to have their genitals pierced under Heath's amendment. The attention arose from both the difference in the way Heath's amendment treated women and men and from Heath's seeming lack of knowledge regarding the practice he proposed to legislate. The amended bill passed the House 160-0, forcing it back to the Georgia Senate.\n\n\nIn 2013, after an online petition generated by the group Better Georgia, Heath was condemned for his response to legislature creating a $150,000 a year position for former Majority Leader  at Georgia Public Broadcasting. Heath dismissed those who signed the petition as \"childish\" in an email response, and hid in the Secretary of the Senate Office refusing to take questions from the press.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here, Whipper had an encounter with civil rights activism when her graduating class sought to desegregate the . A large group of people in her class applied to the College of Charleston, but their efforts of desegregation were unsuccessful. After becoming a private school, the college was able to stay segregated.Parker, Adam. \"Seeing Glory; Long March from Selma Leads Barack Obama to King's Promised Land.\" ''The Post and Courier'', Jan 18, 2009, pp. E.1''.

Later, Whipper went to the , graduating in 1955 with a Masters of Arts degree in political science.\n\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from Talladega College, Whipper went back to Charleston where she taught social studies at public schools. Then, in 1955 (after graduating from the University of Chicago), Whipper returned to Charleston where she worked as the director of guidance services at two prominent all-black high schools: Burke High School and . In the late 1960s, Whipper and a few others jumped on the opportunity to start Operation Catch-Up, a program funded by a federal grant coming from Andrew Johnson's “War on Poverty.” Operation Catch-Up sought to tutor and mentor underserved high school students in the Charleston area. As director of this county wide program, Whipper successfully placed many high school graduates into colleges and universities.\n\nIn 1972, Whipper landed a job at the College of Charleston as Director of the Office of Human Relations and Assistant to the President, making her the first African American to hold this position. Serving under administrator Theodore Stern, Whipper led the way in developing the school's first affirmative action plan. In 1975, Whipper took a leave of absence to focus her attention back to public schooling. During this time, she worked on directing a multimillion-dollar federal project called the Elementary and Secondary School Aid Act (ESSA). As director of ESSA, Whipper worked in collaboration with the Charleston County School District to develop school programs in the area.\n\nAfter two years, Whipper returned to the College of Charleston where she continued her work as Director of the Office of Human Relations and Assistant to the President. At the College of Charleston, she helped transform her old High School (the Avery Institute) into the Avery Institute of Afro-American History and Culture. With the support of a variety of members on the Charleston College Academic board and the president of the college, ,  Whipper was able to organize the Avery Institute of Afro-American History and Culture committee. In 1985, this committee created the Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture. Whipper's work and dedication to the Avery Institute played a critical role in its preservation and integration with the College of Charleston. Whipper eventually ended her career at the College of Charleston in 1981 when she retired.\n\n\nWhipper first entered politics in 1972 when she served as vice chairman of the Democratic Party Convention. She was eventually elected to the school board of Charleston District 20, a position she held from 1978 to 1982. Later, Whipper sought a position of greater public service, and in 1986, she became the first African American woman to be elected to a South Carolina seat in the House of Representatives. Whipper was the first women of color to ever be elected to the , too. Whipper was a democrat and represented seat 109, a working class district covering parts of the East Copper area, North Charleston, and the center of the Charleston peninsula.Baxley, Colette. \"Three in Running for House 109 Seat.\" ''The Post and Courier'', May 29, 1996, pp. 1''. ProQuest Central''. She served for ten years where she had two major legislative contributions. She sponsored one piece of legislature that made marital rape a crime, and another piece of legislature that allowed minorities and females to be hired more easily in the workplace. In addition, Whipper fought for women to get insurance coverage for mammograms.Wenger, Yvonne. \"Black, Female, Elected, Ready to Lead.\" ''The Post and Courier'', Oct 2, 2007, pp. B1''.

His death forced Whipper to move back to Charleston and provide for her infant son while teaching at public high schools. In 1957, Whipper married Reverend Benjamin Whipper, who later died on June 13, 1998, at 85 years old.Willoughby, Laura. \"Baptist Minister Whipper Dies at 85.\" ''The Post and Courier'', Jun 15, 1998, pp. 1''. ProQuest Central''. Benjamin Whipper had 5 children from a previous relationship, and Lucille Whipper had one child from a previous relationship. When they got married, their families blended and they had one child together. The Whipper's sent all seven of their children to college.Frazier, Eric. \"Benjamin Whipper 'Gentle Ben' Pillar of Church.\" ''The Post and Courier'', Apr 6, 1996, pp. 1''. ProQuest Central''. One of their children, , followed in Whipper's footsteps and served as a representative in the South Carolina House of Representatives.\n\nWhipper's husband, Benjamin, was a prominent member of the church. He was a pastor at two Charleston churches (Charity Baptist Church and St. Matthew Baptist Church) for nearly five decades. In addition, he became a prominent member of the  Inc where he became well aquaninted with some of the most influential baptist's in the nation. Like her husband, Whipper was also involved with the church. For example, Whipper served as a faculty member of the National Congress of Christian Education. In addition, Whipper was president of the Women's Educational and Missionary Convention of South Carolina.\n\n\nOutside of the church and after retirement from the House of Representatives, Whipper continued her activist endeavors.Diette, Courrege. \"New Committee Backs 4 in Race for School Board Seats.\" ''McClatchy - Tribune Business News'', Oct 5, 2006, pp. 1''. ProQuest Central''. In 2003, for example, Whipper founded Low Country Aid to Africa (LCAA), an organization dedicated towards raising awareness and money for Africa.Hardin, Jason. \"Lowcountry Group Aims to Aid Africa.\" ''The Post and Courier'', May 18, 2003, pp. B1''. ProQuest Central.''McCray, Jack. \"Low Country Aid to Africa Fundraiser.\" ''The Post and Courier'', Jan 20, 2011, pp. E6''. ProQuest Central''. LCAA was ultimately created because Whipper believed the media was ignoring Africa's problems, especially since the . This initiative has raised tens of thousands of dollars for both African children affected by AIDS and local  prevention clinics.\n\nIn 2006, Whipper and retired financial executive Paul Hines actively backed 4 people (Toya Green, Ruth Jordan, Gregg Meyers and Susan Simons) in a Charleston County school board race. Whipper was co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Education Committee, a group that opposed the incumbents from getting reelected. To Whipper, the incumbent school board members (Lurline Fishburne, Ray Toler, Robin Beard, and ) threatened the future of Charleston education because they were far more concerned with politics than children's education.\n\nIn addition, Whipper was also a supporter of the Circle of Influence Leadership Summit that occurred in December 2007. This summit, which was sponsored by  South Carolina, was an opportunity for black women to come together and find a way to solve social problems that persist in their communities. Whipper hoped that this summit would address the decrease in black women officeholders and put more black women in office. This, to Whipper, was important because of the unique perspective black women bring to politics.\n\n\nLucille Whipper died on Friday, August 27, 2021. Her son, Seth Whipper, said there was no underlying cause for her death. Her funeral was held on Friday, September 3, 2021, at Grace Funeral Services, located at 1947 Highway 52,  29461. At the time of her death, Whipper had 19 grandchildren, 23 great-grandchildren, and 26 great-great-grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\n*   on \n*  on \n*  on \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Although Mildred Arnall was not particularly fond of politics and stayed out of the political arena, she stood by her husband throughout his career and encouraged him to succeed at whatever he did.\n\n\n\nActions undertaken by Governor  had caused the state's colleges to lose accreditation. Arnall unseated Talmadge in the 1942 primary, 174,757 (57.7 percent) to 128,394 (42.4 percent). Without  opposition, Arnall became the youngest governor then serving in the United States.\n\nArnall obtained the repeal of the , ratification in 1945 of a new state constitution, and a state employee merit system. He also retired the Georgia state debt. When young men were drafted into the armed forces during , Arnall argued that youths old enough to fight in war should be able to vote for their country's leadership. He succeeded in lowering the voting age to eighteen more than two decades before the  implemented that change nationally. Georgia thus became the first state to grant the franchise to 18-year-olds. Arnall also removed the prison system from under the governor's direct control, establishing a board of corrections to oversee state prisons and a pardon and parole board to handle such requests. He removed the  from political machinations, and he led efforts to prevent a governor from exercising dictatorial powers, as opponents of Governor Eugene Talmadge had allegedly stated, had occurred during that administration. Arnall's reforms won him attention from the national press. Additionally, Arnall, a proponent of , argued that African Americans should be able to vote in the state's primary election.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis career declined as he was unable to persuade the legislature to allow him to seek re-election. Arnall stood behind 's efforts to remain Vice President in 1944, when the former  was replaced by   of . Arnall adhered to the  decision banning the all-white Democratic party primary in the case '''' and hence opened the crucial Democratic s to African Americans. This move particularly enraged Talmadge and his supporters, who used the issue to brand Arnall a 'race-traitor'.\n\nEugene Talmadge was elected governor once again in 1946 over  (who was supported by Arnall) and another former governor, . However, he died a month before he was scheduled to take office in January 1947. The state legislature then elected Talmadge's son, , as governor. Arnall refused to resign the office during the controversy, and the younger Talmadge ended up locking Arnall out of his office in the state capitol. Arnall soon endorsed 's   \ninitially unsuccessful claim to the office after which  had taken the office after  was removed from the office.\n\n\nAfter leaving office, Arnall worked as an attorney and a businessman in , founding Arnall Golden & Gregory (now Arnall Golden Gregory LLP), which continues to be one of Atlanta's leading law firms. One of his law partners was later U.S. Representative . Arnall served in the  administration for a short time as Director of the . Truman offered Arnall the post of  but he declined in order to return to private practice. His business career made him a multimillionaire, and he was able to live comfortably for most of his life.\n\n\nArnall's last campaign was . His primary opponents for the nomination were , an Atlanta restaurant owner who had hoisted ax handles as a symbol of his opposition to desegregation, and . Maddox called Arnall  \"the granddaddy of forced racial integration ... a candidate who would never raise his voice or a finger - much less an ax handle - to protect the liberty of Georgia.\" Arnall practically ignored Maddox and concentrated his fire on Republican , on whom Arnall had compiled a dossier that he said would guarantee Republican defeat in the general election. Arnall won a plurality of the vote in the primary but was denied the required majority, because of support for Carter, then a state senator representing , Georgia. Arnall barely campaigned in the runoff, and the result was a surprising victory for Maddox. Carter had refused to endorse Arnall, but he formally supported Maddox in the general election against Callaway.\n\nMaddox defeated Arnall in the runoff, 443,055 to 373,004. The civil rights activist , denounced what he called \"a corroding cancer in the Georgia body politic. Georgia is a sick state produced by the diseases of a sick nation. This election revealed that Georgia is desperately competing with  for the bottom.\"''Atlanta History'', p. 40 Mayor , of Atlanta, who once worked for Arnall's law firm, blamed Arnall's loss on the \"combined forces of ignorance, prejudice, reactionism, and the duplicity of many Republican voters,\" many of whom are believed to have voted for Maddox in the Democratic runoff on the theory that Maddox would be a weaker opponent for Callaway than Arnall would have been.\n\nStunned Arnall backers announced a write-in candidacy for the general election, a move that impacted Callaway more than it did Maddox. In the general election, Callaway finished in the tabulation with a slight plurality over Maddox. Arnall received more than 69,000 write-in ballots, far exceeding the margin between Callaway and Maddox. Arnall actually carried one county,  in the southeastern portion of the state. Under the election rules then in effect, the state legislature was required to select a governor from the two candidates with the highest number of votes. Despite court challenges, the Democratic-dominated legislature overwhelmingly voted for Maddox, who became governor in 1967.\n\nAfter the 1966 campaign, Arnall never again sought public office.\n\nArnall was an active .\n\nHe wrote the 1946 book, ''The Shore Dimly Seen'' (), about politics and challenges of the South.\n\n\n\n published the 1991 biography, ''The Politics of Change in Georgia: A Political Biography of Ellis Arnall''.\n\nHe died in 1992 on his large estate. He was worth tens of millions of dollars at the time of his death.

He is a Sudbury, Massachusetts native and attended , graduating in 2004. He went on to graduate from  summa cum laude in the  in 2008. He earned his  cum laude from  in 2014, where he was Executive Director of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. Nicholson is bilingual in English and Spanish.\n\n\nNicholson received the Skadden Fellowship out of Harvard Law School, and designed, launched, and led a new community economic development practice in . Here he represented underserved communities in entrepreneurial and small business legal matters. He also helped make recommendations adopted by the Lynn City Council to support economic development in the city. In 2016 he was elected to the Lynn School Committee, serving three two-year terms. During that time, he helped develop a new initiative for students across the district to learn job skills after school, and founded the city's wrestling team. Since 2016, Nicholson, who wrestled at Princeton, has hosted a beach wrestling tournament every summer to support Lynn wrestling. Prior to being elected Mayor, Nicholson worked as a business lawyer for startups at Latham & Watkins and later as a law professor at Northeastern University, where he worked with and researched small businesses. He stopped teaching once elected as Mayor.\n\n\nIn 2021 Nicholson was elected mayor of  defeating City Council President  in all 28 precincts of the city. Cyr had a significant fundraising advantage over Nicholson and Paris Alston of  reflected that “[s]ome wondered if Nicholson was too new to the city to become its top executive. But voters were persuaded by his ideas around the city’s growth and development being inclusive for all.” The Mayor also serves as the Chairperson of the School Committee of the .\n\nNicholson has made the cost of housing one of his administration’s top priorities, creating an affordable housing trust fund with the City Council that has funded projects creating hundreds of affordable units. One of Nicholson’s first accomplishments in office was to reform the City’s development process, working with the City Council, to allow for a more coherent and coordinated review by City officials. The streamlined process soon yielded a historic contribution by a developer on a major project to affordable housing. Property tax relief programs for senior citizens were also increased early in Nicholson’s administration. In his first year in office, Nicholson delivered on a campaign commitment to deliver inclusionary zoning, working with the City Council, that has been calibrated to encourage continued growth while also creating affordable housing for Lynn residents. Nicholson’s administration also designed and implemented a program to provide free legal representation to residents being evicted from their homes. Governor  appointed Nicholson to her Administration’s statewide Housing Advisory Council.\n\nAnother of Nicholson’s top priorities has been the conditions of Lynn’s schools. To alleviate overcrowding, Nicholson is leading a multi-year process to build a new middle school and worked with the state legislative delegation to improve state funding for school projects to make the project feasible. He has also focused expanding access to quality pre-K education, with Lynn Public Schools adding 97 seats for the 2023 school year and another 118 for 2024. The schools also opened the Frederick Douglass Collegiate Academy on North Shore Community College’s campus, a pioneering partnership between the Lynn Public Schools and North Shore Community college that gives high school students the opportunity to attend college-level courses at no cost to them while still enrolled in high school. The Nicholson Administration also received approval for the purchase of a headquarters building of a bank that was downsizing to allow for the creation of additional classroom space in school building offices.\n\nNicholson has pushed to bring good-paying jobs to Lynn and connect Lynn to the region’s innovation economy, achieving an upgrade in MassBIO’s designation of Lynn’s readiness for life sciences growth from bronze to platinum, supporting the vocational school’s launch of a preparatory program for careers in biotechnology, and working with the City Council to rezone key parcels to facilitate job growth. The focus of Nicholson’s administration on jobs has included a major increase in the City’s involvement in workforce development by preparing Lynn residents for good careers, funding Commercial Driver’s License training to fill a City hiring need, expanding access to English classes, and supporting the vocational school’s expansion of adult education in high demand trades.\n\nA focal point for inclusive long-term growth has been Lynn’s waterfront, the subject of an extensive, coordinated planning effort. The City approved what would be the largest private sector development in the City’s history, a $450 million mixed-use development of 850 units, 26,000 square feet of commercial space, and an 8-acre public park. A new 20+ acre public park is scheduled to open on the site of a former landfill in 2025.\n\nNicholson has made inclusivity a hallmark of his Administration, leading an effort to improve language access to city services for multilingual residents by hiring a team of interpreters. He has announced plans for the City to launch an independent, unarmed crisis response team to address mental health needs and further racial justice. The schools have dramatically increased their mental health support for students through the hiring of social workers and clinicians. Nicholson has also sought to increase the availability and utilization of lifesaving Nalaxone as part of the efforts to combat the opioid crisis as the City has experienced a promising downward trend in opioid overdose deaths. His administration instituted a door-to-door canvassing program for City officials to visit neighborhoods experiencing community violence, launched a mentor connection program, and drastically expanded summer youth jobs.\n\nNicholson has also focused on improving the City’s infrastructure, including major upgrades to the City’s streets, an overhaul of the parks system, a noticeable escalation in the City’s efforts to combat litter, a committed approach to the clean-up of the City’s main beach, King’s Beach, and the establishment of a new senior center, as well as financial stability, attaining a credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor’s from A to A+ and paying off ahead of schedule the debt the City had previously issued under state oversight to balance its budget. Nicholson also led the creation of the City’s first comprehensive plan, “Vision Lynn,” which won multiple planning awards. He has worked with the City’s legislative delegation to successfully advocate for the return of the Lynn ferry service and a temporary platform after Lynn’s commuter rail station was closed, as well as future expansion of service and electrification for near-rapid transit service. Nicholson also finalized a conservation restriction for Lynn Woods, a 2,200 acre municipal forest park, permanently guaranteeing its preservation.\n\nIn 2024, Nicholson accepted a Municipal Innovation Award on behalf of the City in recognition of its efforts to combat hunger through a collaborative, multi-service food hub.\n\n\nNicholson lives in Lynn with his wife, Katherine, and their sons, Henry and Benjamin.\n\nNicholson has a younger brother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The marriage ended in divorce.\nPressley grew up on the north side of Chicago and attended , where she was a cheerleader, did modeling and  work, appeared in  bus advertisements, and was a .

When Pressley was elected to the Boston City Council, her mother would often attend the public meetings, wearing a hat that said \"Mama Pressley\".\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994, Pressley attended the  at , before leaving school to take a full-time job at the Boston Marriott Copley Place to support her mother, who had lost her job.

She worked collaboratively with community members to develop a  and health curriculum which was implemented in .\n\nIn June 2014, the Boston City Council unanimously passed an ordinance Pressley coauthored with Councilor , which prohibits its city government \"from contracting with any health insurer that denies coverage or 'discriminates in the amount of premium, policy fees, or rates charged...because of  or expression\". This ordinance guaranteed healthcare (including , , and  services) to  city employees and their dependents. Pressley declared, \"We can't be a world-class city if anyone is made to feel like a second-class citizen.\"\n\n]]\n\nPressley worked on the issue of s in the city. The ultimate product of Pressley's push was the passage of state legislation in 2014 granting Boston the authority to distribute 75 additional liquor licenses over a three year period, with the aim of distributing them to less advantaged neighborhoods in order to increase economic activity in those neighborhoods. However, '''''s Meghan Irons observed that an unintentional impact of this was that, \"it created uneven competition. It left out certain neighborhoods. It allowed businesses that were already established to get the licenses.\" Nevertheless, in 2018, '''' called Pressley's work on the matter a \"major accomplishment\". To remedy the shortfalls, Pressley worked with Mayor Walsh to further expand the number of new available liquor licenses. In 2017, Pressley and Mayor Walsh unveiled a proposal to increase the number of liquor license in the city by 152 over a three year period, with the majority of licenses being granted to underserved communities.\n\n, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee , and Suffolk County Clerk of Courts Criminal Business  at the Boston Caribbean Carnival parade in August 2012]]\n\nIn 2017, the Council passed the Equity in City of Boston Contracts Ordinance, which was sponsored by Pressley and Councilor Michelle Wu.

It also required the city to actively solicit bids from at least one female-owned business and one minority-owned business for contracts under $50,000. It also created a quarterly reporting requirement for the city.\n\nAccording to Erin O'Brien, a political science professor at ,  Pressley did not have the reputation for being controversial or an outsider during her time on the City Council. O'Brien, in 2018, observed that the city's \"old guard\" viewed Pressley as a \"showboat\" but that, \"in many , she is viewed as incredibly exciting and voicing issues the council has ignored.\"\n\n campaign of ]]\n\nIn the Boston City council election of , Pressley finished first among at-large candidates with 37,000 votes. She led in 13 of the city's 22 wards and finished second in three others. Pressley won Boston's communities of color and many progressive neighborhoods. In all, she placed first in more than half of Boston's 22 wards.

The GOP has only nominated a candidate in this district five times since longtime Speaker  retired in 1986.\n\nThe 7th district is traditionally Democratic and is the state's only district where the majority of residents are not white.

While some political commentators distinguished Pressley's campaign from the one of Ocasio-Cortez as Capuano was understood to have one of the most progressive records in Congress, the incumbents both represented districts in which the majority of voters are not white.\n\nLike Capuano, Pressley campaigned as a staunch progressive, admitting that her voting record would likely be almost identical to Capuano's. However, Pressley contended that a reliably liberal voting record was not enough to meet the needs of a district whose demographics and character had changed over the years. She also claimed that the district needed to be represented by someone who would take a more aggressive role in opposing the presidency of . She campaigned with the slogan \"change can't wait\", and promised that she would bring \"activist leadership\".\n\nIn the September 4, 2018, Democratic , Pressley defeated Capuano by a margin of 59% to 41%. The primary victory was a surprise, as the last poll before the election showed Capuano with a significant lead, 48% to 35%. Part of the reason the polls may have been inaccurate was a surge in the number of primary voters. According to Boston NPR station , 24 percent of primary voters in the 7th district primary had not voted in the five previous primaries.

She is a three-time Women's World Longboard Champion, earning the title in 2000, 2001 and 2010.\n\n\nSchumacher is the older of two daughters. Her parents were avid surfers, with her mother having professionally competed in the sport. The family moved to , where Schumacher learned the practice. Her first competition was at age twelve.\n\n\nSchumacher has won multiple national and international surfing titles being best known for women's longboarding. Early in her career, she was a top US female shortboarder on the 1994 and 1996 US Team for the  (ISA). Her most notable international shortboard title was the winner of the 1995 . She turned to longboarding and became a three-time Women's World Longboard Champion, earning the title in 2000, 2001 and 2010.\n\nFrom late 2001 to 2008, Schumacher went on sabbatical from competition and came out as gay. She returned in 2008 to win the Linda Benson Roxy Jam at Cardiff, California, the Women's Longboard Pipeline Pro Champion in 2009, and two-time  (ASP) North American Champion winning in 2008 and 2009.\n\nWhile the world champion, in 2011 Schumacher boycotted the ASP Women's Longboard world tour because of an event hosted in . In an email to ASP administrators she stated, \"I have deep political and personal reservations with being a part of any sort of benefit to a country that actively engages in human-rights violations, specifically those in violation of women.\" It was the first time since 1985 a professional surfer boycotted a major competition.\n\nDuring her surfing career, Schumacher chose not to take sponsorships explaining \"so I can say what I want to say and be who I want to be,\" and became known for her protests against the  and advocacy for women's and gay rights.\n\n\nAfter boycotting the world surfing tour in 2011, Schumacher directed her focus to social justice work on gender equity and increasing LGBTQ+ and BIPOC representation in surfing. In 2013, she launched a viral online campaign demanding Roxy surf wear stop the sexualization of female professional surfers in their advertisements. The advertisement in question was made by Roxy as the main media for a world championship tour surfing contest in Biarritz, Francean event governed by the Association of Surfing Professionals, who up until the global push back had permitted contest sponsors to control media for professional surfing events.\n\nIn 2017, Schumacher published a chapter in the Critical Surf Studies Reader, a seminal anthology introducing the emerging academic field of critical surf studies. Her research focused on the gender pay gap, misogyny, and homophobia within the world of professional surfing.\n\nIn 2019, Schumacher worked with California Assembly member  on Assembly Bill 467, California's \"Equal Pay for Equal Play\" legislation which emerged from conversations between the two. The bill was signed by Governor  in September 2019 and went into effect January 1, 2020.\n\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021 Schumacher, a Democrat, was an elected city council member for .\n\nIn 2016, Schumacher was elected to as an at-large council member having received support for opposing a contentious mall development plan. The community rejected the development plan in a special election in February 2016. Schumacher was the first LGBTQ+ elected official in Carlsbad's history.\n\nSchumacher announced her campaign for mayor of Carlsbad in 2018 with a platform centered on creating a  program. She lost the election to incumbent mayor Matt Hall.\n\nIn April 2020, Schumacher was elected to Carlsbad's District 1 council seat shortly before California went into lock-down due to COVID-19. She initiated a special meeting in January 2021 where she proposed stricter enforcement for restaurants not following California COVID restrictions on indoor dining which failed. In April Schumacher faced a recall led by Republican . According to '''', critics launched the recall effort in part due her to filing restraining orders against three Carlsbad residents which a judge dismissed and ordered her to pay the court costs. Critics also thought her efforts to enforce COVID restrictions hurt small businesses. In July, Schumacher announced her resignation from the council to pursue her education.\n\nIn June 2023, Schumacher became the political director for  Local 569.\n\n\nSchumacher married Maria De Jesus Cerda in 2008.

Mayor  personally praised Kennedy's work in the community.  Kennedy resigned from his position in the program and returned to  in the summer of 1973.\n\nIn 1979, Kennedy founded , a  to provide discounted  to low-income and elderly families in Massachusetts. According to author , Kennedy started the venture \"to alleviate the burden of heating bills for the poor during the  of that year.\" By 1984, Citizens Energy helped provide low-cost heat for 250,000 families. In 2010, Kennedy transformed the organization to become a leader in  generation while continuing to use profits to provide energy savings to low-income families.  (''See  section below.'')\n\n\n  in the 1980s]]\n\n\n\nIn 1986, incumbent Democrat and  , who had held  (a Democratic stronghold in Boston and ) seat since 1953, announced his retirement. Kennedy decided to run for the seat, which his uncle, former president , had held from 1947 to 1953. The Democratic nomination was contested by a number of well-known Democrats including state senator  and state representative . However, Kennedy garnered  from '''' and the retiring O'Neill. Kennedy won the primary with 53%. He won the general election with 72% of the vote. He won re-election in 1988 (80%), 1990 (72%), 1992 (83%), 1994 (99%), and 1996 (84%).\n\n\nKennedy's legislative efforts in the U.S. House of Representatives included\n\n*Expanding the availability of credit to working Americans to buy homes and to open businesses.\n*Requiring public disclosure of bank-lending practices in poorer neighborhoods and disclosure of bank home- approvals and refusals by race, sex, and income.

In his final speech on the U.S. House floor, Kennedy delivered \"an impassioned plea for unity and forgiveness\" in the midst of Congressional debate regarding the proposed articles of  of President .\n\n\nThroughout his career in the U.S. House, Kennedy served on the , where he played an active role in the federal , credit-reporting reform, the overhaul of the  and financial modernization.

(During Kennedy's terms in the House, it had been run by his brother Michael.) Citizens Energy pursues commercial ventures aimed at generating s that, in turn, are used to generate funds that could assist those in need in the U.S. and abroad. It grew to encompass seven separate companies, including one of the largest  firms in the U.S. Citizens Energy became one of the U.S.'s first energy firms to move large volumes of  to more than 30 states. As a precursor to market changes under electricity  in the late 1990s, Citizens Energy was a pioneer in moving and marketing electrical power over the . In recent years, Kennedy has led the company into the renewable-energy industry, building solar farms along the East Coast and transmission lines to support charitable programs like one giving free solar panels to low-income families in California. In 2019, Citizens Energy announced the completion of one of the largest Low-Income Community Shared Solar projects in the country, funded by its investment in the Sunrise PowerLink Transmission line. Totaling 30 megawatts, the record-breaking California project will provide $500 in energy savings to 12,000 low-income families each year.\n\n\nSince returning to Citizens Energy, Kennedy also has sought to influence energy-related public policy, challenging the Bush administration to invest in energy conservation and efficiency and renewable energy, encouraging Congress to fully fund federal heating assistance programs, proposing that oil-consuming countries work together to balance oil prices against  (OPEC) manipulation, and calling for the federal government and major oil companies to use portions of royalties from oil and gas extracted from federal lands and waters to help low-income families with the high price of energy. Kennedy has been criticized for the salaries paid to himself and his wife. In 2012, as CEO of Citizens Energy and related organizations, Kennedy was paid a total of $796,000 in compensation, and his wife was paid an additional $344,000 as Director of Marketing.\n\n\nBeginning in 2005,  (Citgo), a wholly owned  of  (PDVSA)the n  oil companyhas been the primary  of heating oil to Citizens Energy. '''' and others criticized Citizens Energy for continuing its relationship with the  and  , a harsh critic of the United States. In response, Kennedy and others have argued that it is hypocritical to criticize a non-profit organization for accepting oil from Venezuela while numerous other American businesses are profiting from robust trade with Venezuela and at a time when the U.S. government has cut low-income fuel assistance.\n\nAlthough Citgo donations reportedly dried up in 2015 owing to Venezuela's economic turmoil, the company was reported in 2009 to have donated 83 million gallons of oil over the two previous years, which was used to provide heating assistance to an estimated 200,000 families a year in 23 states.\n\nKennedy has since turned into a critic of Venezuelan president , the handpicked successor of Chávez, accusing him of \"stealing democracy from the people\" and calling for Maduro's removal.\n\n\n\nIn 1993, a ''Boston Globe'' poll showed Kennedy within one percentage point of popular incumbent  in a hypothetical gubernatorial match-up, prompting prominent state Democrats to try and recruit him for the race. Though no other Democrat was polling near Weld, Kennedy decided to forgo the race and remain in Congress.  won the nomination and  by over 40 points.\n\nKennedy was considered the front runner for the , but revelations about his personal life led to a tumultuous fall in public opinion polling, and he decided against running.\nKennedy explained in a VFW hall in a working-class corner of Boston that he believed he would never be able to focus his candidacy on issues: \"The race will focus on personal or family questions. It is not fair to my family, it is not fair to the people of Massachusetts and it is not the right thing to do.\"\n\n\nWith the death of his uncle  on August 25, 2009, Kennedy's name had been mentioned as a possible candidate for his uncle's  seat representing Massachusetts. In an  article, Democratic strategist Dan Payne said, \"He wouldn't be human and he wouldn't be a Kennedy if he didn't give serious consideration to running for what is known as the 'Kennedy seat' in Massachusetts.\" However, Kennedy released a statement on September 7 explaining that he would not pursue the seat. The seat eventually went by appointment to  and later by election to Republican .\n\n\nKennedy endorsed incumbent Democrat 's  in the  over  by his brother Robert Jr.\n\n\n, November 2011]]\nOn February 22, 1972, Kennedy was on  when it was hijacked. Shortly after the inflight movie began during the 747's flight from New Delhi to Athens, five gunmen seized the jet and forced it to land at , where all hostages were released the following day.\n\nIn August 1973, a  he was driving on  overturned, fracturing a vertebra of his brother David and permanently  David's girlfriend, Pam Kelley. The police cited Kennedy for   and the judge temporarily suspended his driver's license. The Kennedy family paid for Kelley's initial medical treatment and contributed modestly to her care during the years following the accident. \n\n\nOn February 3, 1979, Kennedy married Sheila Brewster Rauch, a daughter of banker Rudolph Stewart \"Stew\" Rauch Jr., president and then chairman of the . On October 4, 1980, the couple had fraternal twin sons, Matthew Rauch \"Matt\" Kennedy and . They were legally divorced in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Kennedy asked the  for an  of his marriage to Rauch, claiming he was mentally incapable of entering into marriage at the time of the wedding. An annulment would have rendered the marriage void in the Church. This would have also allowed Kennedy to marry Anne Elizabeth \"Beth\" Kelly a former staff member of his, in a Catholic ceremony, as well as allow him to continue receiving  (which is forbidden for a divorced person who remarries outside of the Church). Rauch refused to agree to the annulment; Kennedy married Kelly in a non-Catholic  on October 23, 1993.\n\nThe Boston Archdiocese initially ruled in favor of the annulment, which Rauch says she discovered only after the fact, in 1996. An , she later wrote a book, ''Shattered Faith: A Woman's Struggle to Stop the Catholic Church from Annulling Her Marriage'', explaining that she was opposed to the concept of annulment because it meant in Catholic theology that the marriage had never actually existed. She also claimed that the Kennedy family influence made it possible to unilaterally \"cancel\" a 12-year marriage. \n\n at the time required a  decision in favor of annulment to be automatically appealed, and the decision was not effective until a second, conforming, sentence was granted. Instead of allowing the appeal to take place in the United States, Rauch appealed directly to the , the highest appellate tribunal of the Catholic Church. The annulment was overturned by the Rota in 2005. Rauch says she was not informed of the decision until 2007, receiving the news from Boston Archdiocese officials. As the first decision was never confirmed, there was no time at which the Church finally declared the marriage to be null or gave Kennedy permission to remarry. Because the Rota was sitting as a second-instance appellate court, Kennedy could appeal against the decision to another Rotal panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Incumbent Francis Archibald resigned the seat and Brown won handily over opponent Ed Sessions in a June 1985 special election. When the Republicans gained control of the state house in 1994, Brown became chairman of the Ways and Means committee and helped deliver the largest tax cut in state history. He also served as chairman of the state's Joint Tax study Committee and was one of the vocal leaders of a massive 1998 tax proposal.\n\nWhen 1st District Congressman  decided to honor a pledge to serve no more than six years in the House, Brown ran for the seat, passing out \"\" candy bars during the  as a way to increase his name recognition.

The district had been considered unwinnable for a Democrat since the 1990s round of redistricting shifted most of Charleston's black voters to the majority-black 6th District.  However, polls from the summer of 2008 onward showed a closer-than-expected race.

Brown lost badly in  largely due to  winning it with 54 percent of the voteonly the second time a Democratic presidential candidate has carried the county since 1956.  However, Brown crushed Ketner in Berkeley and Dorchester counties, enabling him to secure a fifth term.  He was also likely helped by  carrying the district with 56 percent of the vote; aside from  in 1976, the district had supported a Republican for president in every election since 1956.\n\nOn January 4, 2010, Brown announced that he would retire from the House and not seek re-election.\n\nIn June 2023, Brown endorsed  in the .\n\n\nIn 2004, Henry Brown set a controlled burn on his own property, but the fire spread to the neighboring , burning .

Brown commented regarding the affair that, \"I was so taken aback that I'd be treated so impersonal  like I was some kind of crook...Those were criminal charges that were filed against me.

President  visited Birmingham twice to campaign for Woodfin.\n\n\n\n\nWoodfin promised throughout the campaign to conduct a  audit on city finances, but upon taking office instead conducted a .\n\nIn March 2018, Woodfin's transition committee announced it had discovered that the city's pension fund had been consistently underfunded for more than 15 years, endangering the city's credit rating and retirement benefits for thousands of city employees. Woodfin increased funding to the pension fund by $2.9 million in the city's 2019 budget, and by $5.2 million in the city's 2020 budget  which Woodfin's administration claimed fully met the city's obligation to the fund for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nWoodfin's administration has drawn criticism for a perceived lack of transparency, with  columnist Kyle Whitmire calling Woodfin's attempts to block public information requests \"stalling and stonewalling\" and a violation of his campaign promises to increase transparency.\n\n\nIn his first two years in office, Woodfin budgeted $13 million for street resurfacing, $2.5 million toward clearing overgrown lots, and $6.5 million toward demolishing dilapidated structures. Woodfin has argued that his predecessor's policy regarding  was \"not as aggressive as it needed to be\" and that it would be a \"priority\" for his administration.\n\n\nBirmingham's high violent crime rate was a central plank of Woodfin's campaign platform; his nephew, Ralph Woodfin III, was shot and killed in August 2017, just weeks before the general election.\n\nShortly after Woodfin took office in November 2017, Birmingham Police Department Chief A.C. Roper announced his resignation. After a lengthy search, Woodfin appointed former  commander Patrick D.

Woodfin also urged the council to pass a \"shelter-in-place\" ordinance on March 24, which has been extended through the end of April 2020. Under Woodfin, the Birmingham City Council voted to extend the city's mask mandates through May 24, 2021, after Governor  announced that the statewide mandate would end April 9.\n\n\nFor years, Birmingham residents had been requesting Birmingham take down the Confederate monument located in the park across the street from Birmingham City Hall. Due to years of inaction, and after the , residents took to the street to try and take down the monument themselves. The next morning Woodfin ordered the removal of the  in Linn Park to try and prevent another protest. He also filed an executive order that declared a state of emergency, which established a 24-hour ban on public demonstrations and gatherings of all kinds in the city, and instituted a public safety curfew of one week. Alabama Attorney General  filed suit against the city of Birmingham for violating the .\n\n\nHe endorsed  in the , despite having received ' endorsement during his 2017 mayoral race.

In a 2019 interview with '''', Woodfin argued that \"being a moderate does not equal status quo... I support a lot of things on the left butif I’m being realI also believe you gotta win... The base of the Democratic party is the center.\"\n\nWhen running for mayor of Birmingham in 2017, Woodfin promised to \"fight to make Birmingham a .\" However, in 2018 he reneged on that promise and instead proposed to make Birmingham a \"welcoming city.\"\n\nWoodfin acknowledges the harmful impacts of climate change and in 2018 he signed the \"Alabama Mayors for 100% Sustainable Energy Pledge\" by the GASP (Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution) to fulfill a campaign promise.

A member of the , he was first elected to the council in 1999, serving an initial five terms between 2000 until 2010. During this initial tenure, he served as vice president of the council in 2001 and as council president from 2002 to 2006.

His election resulted in the unseating of longtime incumbent . He was then re-elected to four additional two-year terms, holding office until January 2010.\n\nAfter serving as vice president of the council in 2001,, Flaherty was reelected to the council in . In January 2002, Flaherty was elected by his fellow city councilors to serve as the council's president. Mayor , who Flaherty had established a strong relationship with, had maneuvered to secure Flaherty the votes needed to become council president. During Flaherty's two-consecutive  terms as council president, the council numerous times violated the state's open meetings law, for which it was successfully sued by Kevin McCrea, leading the council to plead guilty in 2008 to having violated the state's open meetings law between 2003 and 2005 by meeting illegally to discuss projects of the Boston Planning Agency () and an outbreak at a  bio-laboratory. Flaherty also was regarded as somewhat  in his leadership of the council, often using parliamentary rules to prevent debate on matter that he regarded as immaterial for the council to discuss.\n\nFlaherty was reelected in . He was the city council election's top vote-getter. Flaherty's margin of victory over first runner-up  was 5,671 votes, which was the widest margin since the council had been restructured in 1983. After the newly elected council took office in January 2004, Flaherty was elected by the council members to serve a second-consecutive term as the council's president.\n\nFlaherty won reelection in , again placing as the city council election's top vote-getter. He received only 14,000 fewer votes than Mayor Menino had in the coinciding . Viewing Flaherty's rising stature as a political threat, Menino successfully maneuvered to get  elected council president in January 2007 instead of Flaherty. In turn, Flaherty became a vocal critic of the mayor. Flaherty gave particularly strong opposition to a proposal by the mayor to relocate the city government headquarters from the existing  to a new city hall along the city's waterfront. Flaherty won reelection in  and was once again the city council election's top vote-getter. Flaherty did not run for re-election in , instead opting to run for .\n\n\nFlaherty established political ties to the city's gay community.

In 2023, Flaherty stated that his early support for same-sex marriage was what he was proudest of from his time on the council.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaherty announced on January 25, 2009, that he would run for mayor of Boston in that year's election. By February 2009, he had raised more than $600,000 for his campaign. According to '''', at that time, only 9% of Flaherty's contributions came from out-of-state, compared to fellow candidate 's 58%. Flaherty's campaign was also supported by a number of s.\n\nFinishing second behind incumbent mayor  in the September , Flaherty advanced to face Menino in the general election. In the general election, Flaherty pledged that he would re-create the position of deputy mayor and appoint Yoon deputy to the role. This position had not existed in Boston since the administration of , who left office in 1984. Yoon thereafter campaigned as Flaherty's unofficial .\n\nThe 2009 election was regarded to be the first time that Menino had faced a significant challenge for reelection. Flaherty had higher name-recognition and more funding than Menino's previous challengers. However, Flaherty was defeated by Menino in the  on November 3, 2009. Flaherty lost by the smallest margin (57% to 42%) of anyone who ran against Menino in a mayoral race.\n\n\nAfter leaving the city council, Flaherty practiced private-sector law.\n\n, the first election since his departure from the council, Flaherty sought election to rejoin the body as an at-large member. Flaherty placed fifth in the general election for the four at-large, missing the fourth and final seat by 925 votes.\n\nIn making his endorsements for the 2011 election, Sam Yoon (Flaherty's unofficial running mate from two years prior) snubbed Flaherty and instead endorsed two of his opponents.\n\n\n\n\n, Flaherty, Mayor , and Congressman  during Boston's 2023  celebrations]]\n\nIn the  election, Flaherty was returned to the council as an at-large member.\n\nFlaherty was reelected in , , , and .

Flaherty cited discord on the council and a desire to spend more time with his family as his motivations for retiring from the council. Flaherty has stated that he has no immediate plans of running for other office.\n\n\nFlaherty worked on the Jim Brooks Act, a home-rule petition which (if approved by the state government) would have enacted a number of measures to protect tenants against , including a city prohibition on no-cause s. The bill passed the council in October and was soon after approved by Boston Mayor  to be referred to the  (the state legislature) for passage. However, the legislation did not receive traction in the state legislature.\n\nIn February 2023, Flaherty expressed reservations about the  home rule petition that Mayor Michelle Wu had sent to council. He cited the years-earlier stall in the state legislature of the Jim Brooks Act he had helped to create, Flaherty urged city council members to not to passing a rent control home rule petition (which would need state approval to become law) unless there was a desire by state legislators to enact as law. He also expressed worry about the possibility that rent stabilization would put landlords with smaller property portfolios at a disadvantage in competing against those holding larger portfolios. In March 2023, when the petition came to a vote, Flaherty proposed an amendment to exempt properties or Boston-resident landlords who own fewer than six units and live within one of the units themselves. However, the amendment failed after only receiving support from three other councilors. He voted for the petition, which passed the council 11–2. He also voted the same day to advance Wu's home-rule petition to reform the Boston Planning & Development Agency, which also passed the council 11–2.\n\n\nIn 2015, anticipating a possible legalization of  in Massachusetts, Flaherty proposed that the city adopt a text amendment prohibiting either  dispensary or recreational sales outlets from being located within 2,500  of each other in hopes of preventing a large proliferation of marijuana sales points in any singular community.\n\nFlaherty received media attention in April 2019 for comments he made regarding a proposal to charge for resident parking permits. In a City Council hearing on the issue, he stated that bus stop spacing and stop length were a major cause of the city's parking woes and instead suggested coordinating with the  to start a conversation about removing some of them. His comments were met with backlash from the public and transportation advocates, with many pointing to his ownership of five cars in a city as the real problem. The  hashtag \"#FiveCarFlaherty\" was used by many to voice their opposition to his comments.\n\nIn April 2021, Flaherty was among a group that voted against legislation, which was nevertheless passed by a 7–5 vote of the City Council, that restricted the use of s, , and  by the .\n\n\nFlaherty has continued to reside in South Boston.

Just because Brian Kemp breaks his promises doesn't mean anyone else should.\"\n\nTwo days before the election, Kemp's office announced that it was investigating the Georgia Democratic Party for unspecified \"possible cybercrimes\"; the Georgia Democratic Party stated that \"Kemp's scurrilous claims are 100 percent false\" and described them as a \"political stunt\". A 2020 investigation by the Georgia attorney general's office concluded that there was no evidence of computer crimes. Later that year, it was revealed that the alleged cybercrime against Kemp's office was in fact a planned security test that one of Kemp's staff members had signed off on three months prior.\n\nAs Georgia's secretary of state, Kemp was in charge of elections and voter registration during the election. Kemp was accused of  during the election between him and Abrams.  professor  has criticized Kemp as an \"enemy of democracy\" and \"an expert in voter suppression\" for his actions as secretary of state. Political scientists Michael Bernhard and Daniel O'Neill described Kemp's actions in the 2018 gubernatorial election as the worst case of voter suppression in that election year. Election law expert  called Kemp \"perhaps the most incompetent state chief elections officer\" in the 2018 elections, pointing to a number of actions that jeopardized Georgia's election security and made it harder for eligible voters to vote. Hasen writes that it was \"hard to tell\" which of Kemp's \"actions were due to incompetence and which were attempted suppression.\"\n\nBetween 2012 and 2018, Kemp's office canceled over 1.4 million voter registrations, with nearly 700,000 cancellations in 2017 alone. On a single night in July 2017, half a million voters had their registrations canceled. According to '''', election-law experts said that this \"may represent the largest mass disenfranchisement in US history.\" Kemp oversaw the removals as secretary of state, and did so eight months after he declared his candidacy for governor. An investigative journalism group run by  found that of the approximately 534,000 Georgians whose voter registrations were purged between 2016 and 2017, more than 334,000 still lived where they were registered. The voters were given no notice that they had been purged. Palast sued Kemp, claiming over 300,000 voters were purged illegally. Kemp's office denied any wrongdoing, saying that by \"regularly updating our rolls, we prevent fraud and ensure that all votes are cast by eligible Georgia voters.\"\n\n\n\nBy early October 2018, more than 53,000 voter registration applications had been put on hold by Kemp's office, with more than 75% belonging to minorities. The voters were eligible to re-register if they still lived in Georgia.\n\nIn a ruling against Kemp, district judge  found that Kemp's office had violated the  and said an attempt by Kemp's office to expedite the certification of results \"appears to suggest the secretary's foregoing of its responsibility to confirm the accuracy of the results prior to final certification, including the assessment of whether serious provisional balloting count issues have been consistently and properly handled.\"\n\nOn November 6, 2018, Abrams lost the election by 54,723 votes. On November 16, 2018, Abrams announced that she was ending her campaign. She emphasized that her statement was not a concession, because \"concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true, or proper\", but acknowledged that she could not close the gap with Kemp to force a runoff. In her campaign-ending speech, Abrams announced the creation of , a voting rights nonprofit organization that sued the secretary of state and state election board in federal court for voter suppression. Fair Fight was supported by Jess Moore Matthews and her  and others committed to ensuring full representation\n\nFair Fight's lawsuit was initiated in December 2018; according to ''Politico'', it \"started as a sprawling case that included allegations of unreasonably long lines and wait times caused by moving and closing polling places; the impact of voter ID rules on people of color, voters with non-Anglo Saxon names and newly naturalized citizens; improper maintenance of Georgia's voter rolls; inadequate training of poll workers; and even the integrity of voting machines\". Six months after the lawsuit began, the Georgia legislature passed a law addressing some of its claims, with measures including the implementation of new voting machines with more advanced technology. Fair Fight dropped the claims about voting machines in December 2020, around the time that Donald Trump made baseless claims about voting machine problems in Georgia affecting the 2020 presidential election. In February 2021, a federal judge ruled that Fair Fight's claims about voting machines, voter list security, and polling place issues were resolved by changes in Georgia's election law, or invalidated due to lack of  to sue.\n\nIn April 2021, a judge allowed some claims in the legal challenge to proceed while rejecting others. In October 2022, a federal judge ruled against Fair Fight on the remaining claims, finding that Georgia's voting regulations did not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. According to the judge, the case \"resulted in wins and losses for all parties over the course of the litigation and culminated in what is believed to have been the longest voting rights bench trial in the history of the Northern District of Georgia.\" Over the course of the lawsuit, Fair Fight raised $61 million and paid millions to Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams's campaign chair.\n\nSince losing the election, Abrams has repeatedly said that the election was not fairly conducted and has declined to call Kemp the legitimate governor of Georgia. Abrams has since said that she won the election and that the election was \"stolen from the voters of Georgia\", claims that election law expert  said were unproven, though he argued that \"it's clear that Kemp did everything in his power to put in place restrictive voting policies that would help his candidacy and hurt his opponent, all while overseeing his own election.\" Abrams argued that Kemp, who oversaw the election in his role as secretary of state, had a conflict of interest and suppressed turnout by purging nearly 670,000 voter registrations in 2017, and that about 53,000 voter registrations were pending a month before the election. She has said, \"I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes. However, I have sufficient and I think legally sufficient doubt about the process to say that it was not a fair election.\"\n\nOn November 9, 2018, the '''' reported that its investigation of the 2018 statewide elections in Georgia had found \"no evidence ... of systematic malfeasance – or of enough tainted votes to force a runoff election\". A '''' fact check noted that the actions Kemp's office took during the election \"can be explained as routine under state and federal law\"; political scientist  said there is \"not much empirical evidence supporting the assertion that Kemp either suppressed the vote or 'stole' the election from Abrams.\"\n\nAccording to '''' fact checker , Abrams has variously claimed that she \"won\" the election, that the election was \"rigged\", that it was \"stolen\", that it was not \"free and fair\", and that Kemp had \"cheated\". Kessler said that \"Abrams played up claims the election was stolen until such tactics became untenable for anyone who claims to be an advocate for American democratic norms and values\".\n\n\n in January 2019]]\nOn January 29, 2019,   (D-NY) announced that Abrams would deliver the  on February 5. She was the first African-American woman to give the rebuttal to the address, as well as the first and only non-office-holding person to do so since the State of the Union responses began in 1966. Despite being heavily recruited by Schumer, the , and the  to challenge incumbent senator , on April 30, 2019, Abrams announced that she would not run for the U.S. Senate in 2020. After Senator  announced his resignation due to poor health, Abrams declined to run in that election as well, citing a need to focus on ending voter suppression.\n\nOn August 17, 2019, Abrams announced the founding of Fair Fight 2020, an organization to assist Democrats financially and technically to build voter protection teams in 20 states. Abrams is  2020's chair. Billionaire and former New York City mayor  contributed $5 million shortly after announcing  for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. On 's '''', Abrams defended Bloomberg's spending, saying: \"Every person is allowed to run and should run the race that they think they should run, and Mike Bloomberg has chosen to use his finances. Other people are using their dog, their charisma, their whatever.\" Abrams declined to endorse Bloomberg personally.\n\nDuring the , Abrams actively promoted herself for consideration as former vice president 's running mate.  was officially announced as Biden's running mate on August 11, 2020.

She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary on May 24, 2022, and faced Georgia governor  in the November 8 general election. Abrams and Kemp had their first of two scheduled debates on October 17. In the debate, Abrams emphasized her support for gun control and legal access to abortion, while Kemp emphasized Georgia's economy under his governorship and his anti-crime proposals. When asked whether she would accept the results of the election, Abrams declined to directly respond. In the final debate before the election both candidates agreed to accept the results. Abrams lost the November 8, 2022 election to Kemp; she conceded that night.\n\n\nAbrams supports , advocates for expanded , and opposes proposals for stricter  laws. She has argued that some implementations of voter ID laws disenfranchise minorities and the poor, but does not oppose voter ID laws in principle and supports voters having to verify their identities.

She opposes private school vouchers, instead advocating improvements to the public education system. She supports smaller class sizes, more school counselors, protected pensions, better pay for teachers, and expanded early childhood education.\n\n\nIn her campaign for governor, Abrams said her top priority was  expansion. She cited research showing that Medicaid expansion improved health care access for low-income residents and made hospitals in rural locations financially viable. She also created a plan to address Georgia's high maternal mortality rate.\n\n\nAbrams is a strong supporter of  and rejects \"the demonization and delegitimization of Israel represented\" by the  campaign, which she has called \"anti-Semitic\". However, she voted against  that punishes companies that choose to boycott Israel or . Abrams wrote, \"Boycotts have been a critical part of social justice in American history, particularly for African-Americans.

Three candidates entered the race: 4th Suffolk District State Rep Nick Collins; 12th Suffolk District State Rep ; and 'Caught in Southie' publisher Maureen Dahill. Collins and Dahill are both white and lived in South Boston, while Dorcena-Forry is Haitian-American and lived in the Lower Mills section of Dorechster. Collins received support from a number of unions including the Greater Boston Labor Council, but not the most prominent union member in the state senate district,  State Rep , who stayed neutral in the race. Collins ultimately fell short in the April 30, 2013 Democratic Primary with the final count: Dorcena-Forry 10,220 votes, Collins 9,841 votes, and Dahill with 1,594 votes.\n\nLater in 2013 Collins repaid Walsh's neutrality in his failed State Senate race by endorsing Walsh's opponent in the  for .

In the legislature he advanced several bills aimed at increasing racial and gender diversity in state contracting projects and addressing system injustice, partnering with 11th Hampden District State Rep  of Springfield on an economic equity bill aimed at addressing systemic injustice and racial equity in government, business, public health and the courts. He also filed in another bill aimed to improve economic equality and reduce the racial  in Massachusetts by requiring diversity of race and gender on all development projects on state land. The bill was inspired by the success of the Omni Seaport Hotel, a $550 million development, which included diversity requirements not only for vendors, but also for ownership and financing. Dubbed the “Massport Model,” the legislation was included in a State Senate's economic development package, requires diversity in ownership, as well as construction, design, financing and management on state projects.\n\nCollins was the subject of intense scrutiny when he became one of only a handful of Democrats and the only State Senator representing a minority-majority district to vote against the State Senate's version of a far-reaching police reform bill in 2020, joining 6 of his colleagues in a 30-7 vote. He called the bill’s most controversial element  a provision imposing new limits on the protection police officers enjoy from civil lawsuits  “problematic,” and cited that as the reason for his opposition to the bill. Collins ultimately voted for the compromise bill that became law later in 2020.\n\nCollins considered running for Mayor when incumbent Boston Mayor Marty Walsh resigned in early  to become the US Secretary of Labor under newly elected President Joseph R.

Collins ultimately decided against it, releasing a short statement in late April 2021 that read:“After much encouragement and consideration and discussions with family, I’ve decided I will not be a candidate for mayor. I remain dedicated to my job in the Massachusetts Senate and working with leadership and my colleagues on our shared priorities to help Boston and the Commonwealth grow and thrive.

On the city council, she represented District 4, which includes parts of Boston's , , , and  neighborhoods. A member of the , she was first elected to the council in November 2015 and assumed office in January 2016. She served as president of the council from January 2018 until January 2020.

Campbell was the first black woman to qualify for ballot access for statewide office in Massachusetts. Winning the Democratic Party's nomination with a sizable victory in the Democratic primary, Campbell won the general election by a large margin. In January 2023, she was sworn in as attorney general, becoming the first black woman to hold the office and only the second black person to hold it, preceded only by .\n\n\n as attorney general. With Campbell's birth mother deceased and her birth father imprisoned for much of her childhood, Savage and her husband played a major role in Campbell's upbringing.]]\n  \nCampbell and her twin brother, Andre, were born in , . She has an older brother named Alvin Jr. Soon after she was born, her birth father, , was sentenced to an eight-year prison term. When Campbell was only eight-months-old, her birth mother, Roberta, was killed in a  while driving to visit Campbell's birth father in prison. This forced Campbell and her brothers to spend time residing in  and with various relatives. Campbell refers to Lois and Ron Savage, an aunt and uncle who played a major role in her upbringing, as being her parents. Campbell did not know her birth father until she was eight, at which time he was released from prison.\n\nCampbell was raised in the  and  neighborhoods of Boston in an area that is a key  population and cultural center of the city. Over the course of her youth, Campbell attended five different schools within the  system. Campbell graduated from . While Campbell performed well academically, by the time she was a high school student, both of her brothers had served prison sentences.\n\nCampbell attended  for college. While she was attending Princeton, her birth father died, leaving her an . Campbell graduated from Princeton in 2004. When Campbell was 29, her twin brother, who suffered from , died while in state custody awaiting trial. Campbell has said that the cause of her brother's death is not known to her. Following her graduation from Princeton, Campbell enrolled at the  where she would earn her .\n\n\nAfter graduating from UCLA School of Law, Campbell began her legal career by spending a year working as a staff attorney at EdLaw, a  in Roxbury that provided students and parents with free legal services pertaining to education rights and access to education. After this, Campbell spent two years at the  legal firm where she provided advice to companies located in Boston and  on matters related to employment law and labor relations.\n\nCampbell spent three months working as the interim general counsel for Boston's . She later worked as deputy legal counsel to Governor .\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the , first-time candidate Campbell placed first in the 4th district's  and went on to defeat sixteen-term incumbent  in the  with 61% of the vote. Campbell was the first woman to represent her council district.\n\nCampbell was a supporter of voting \"yes\" on the  referendum in 2016, a  which would have authorized an expansion of the number of s in the state. Campbell was one of only two city councilors to vote against a resolution to voice the City Council's opposition to the ballot measure. The resolution overwhelmingly passed the council 11–2. Campbell faced criticisms from teachers' unions and progressive activists for supporting s. The referendum wound up being heavily defeated by voters.\n\nIn 2016 Campbell and Councilor  introduced an ordinance that would have banned the use of s by employers to negatively assess job applicants and existing hires.\n\nCampbell supported the proposed federal Second Chance Reauthorization Act of 2015, which would have reauthorized the . She introduced an ordinance to the Boston City Council to express support for this.\n\n\nCampbell was reelected in , having run unopposed. Campbell was one of two members of the Boston City Council not to give an endorsement in the coinciding . Besides Campbell, Ayanna Pressley remained neutral (citing her husband's employment by Mayor Walsh), was running against Walsh, and the other ten city councilors endorsed Walsh's reelection campaign.\n\nOn December 9, 2017, Campbell announced that she had unanimous support of her colleagues to be the next president of the council. She was elected council president on January 1, 2018. Campbell was the first African-American woman to hold the position.\n\nIn 2019, as City Council president, Campbell proposed an ordinance to create a city . Mayor  came out in opposition to it. The ordinance was rejected by the City Council in a 9–4 vote. Also in 2019, Campbell and fellow councilor  proposed the idea of a vacancy tax on abandoned residential and commercial properties.\n\nCampbell promoted the idea of extending City Council terms from two years to four years in duration. She argued that longer terms would strengthen the City Council's power in city government and make it a more effective body. Such a proposal would require a home-rule petition to garner state consent. In February 2019, during hearings on this, Campbell proposed making further changes to city election laws, including creating a prohibition from running for more than one municipal office at the same time and changing the law so that  would be held to fill vacant at-large seats rather than the seat being offered to the first runner-up of the previous at-large election. This latter proposal notably came at a moment when  had just joined the Boston City Council to fill the at-large seat left vacant by Ayanna Pressley (who had resigned to join the ) because Garrison had been the first runner-up in the 2017 at-large Boston City Council election. Campbell denied that her proposal was in response to Garrison, instead claiming it came from a belief that giving a seat to someone who had not outright won election to it is undemocratic. Campbell, ultimately, did not combine these ideas into a single petition. She separated them into two different petitions. One petition, which passed the City Council 11–2, requested that the state allow the city to extend Boston City Council term limits to four years. Campbell introduced a separate petition to hold special elections to fill vacant at-large seats.\n\nAfter the chaotic right-wing \" Parade\" event held in Boston in 2019, Campbell called on the city to reassess its approval process for public event permits. Campbell was critical of the event and the public resources that went to providing  and security around it, writing, \"while I am a firm believer in , I’m not okay with wasting tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars for a group to come into Boston from out of state to create chaos and spread hate.\"\n\nCampbell endorsed 's  in the .\n\nIn April 2018, during her City Council presidency, '''' magazine ranked Campbell 51st on its list of the \"100 Most Influential People in Boston\". The magazine wrote that political insiders anticipated a continued political ascent for Campbell. She was one of only three city councilors included in these rankings, joined by Ayanna Pressley (ranked 20th after having won a  primary election victory that made her poised to be elected to the ) and  (ranked 31st). At the end of Campbell's council presidency, Milton J. Valencia of '''' opined that during both Campbell's City Council presidency and the preceding tenure  as City Council president, the council had, \"been, perhaps, the most aggressive in recent history in pushing reforms, often to the  of the mayor, on issues addressing  and economic and racial equity.\"\n\n\nCampbell won reelection to the council in . She was succeeded as president by  in January 2020.\n\nIn June 2020, Campbell was one of the five city councilors in the minority that voted against Mayor Walsh's $3.61 billion operating budget proposal. She argued that it failed to include changes necessary for the city to address its  and . That month, when Walsh announced the creation of a  fund focused on racial inequities, Campbell was somewhat critical. While she supported the creation of the fund itself and acknowledged that she believed philanthropy could play an important role, she argued that it was more important for the city to focus its own budget on such problems. Campbell was also critical of Walsh's coinciding move to create a new cabinet position within his administration dedicated to query and inclusion, considering it a \"duplicative position\" and criticizing Walsh for not instead other \"actionable ideas\" to \"transform inequitable systems\" that had been proposed to Walsh by her and others.\n\nIn July 2020, amid the , Campbell proposed an ordinance to create a police oversight board. Ultimately, the Boston City Council voted later that year to approve a different ordinance creating an Office of Police Accountability that features a civilian police review board and oversight panel for internal affairs, which Mayor Walsh signed into law.\n\nIn 2021, Campbell and fellow councilor Kim Janey proposed an ordinance that would have banned almost all employers in Boston from running credit checks on job seekers, arguing that credit checks are most detrimental to  applicants.\n\nIn April 2021, in her capacity as chair of the public safety committee, Campbell refused to push forward $1.2 million in proposed grants for the . Amid this, she engaged in a  conflict with the account of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, which had issued criticism of Campbell. Campbell contrasted the union's vocal criticism of her with the union's failure to comment on the former  allegations made against a past president of the police union.\n\nIn May 2021, the City Council passed an ordinance by Campbell and  which limits the use of  weapons by officers of the . Acting Mayor Kim Janey signed the ordinance into law. Another such ordinance authored by Campbell and Arroyo had previously been passed by the City Council in December 2020, but had been  by Mayor  in January 2021.\n\nPressley voiced opposition to the police department's use of exams which she contended were \"biased\" in order to weigh promotions of officers. She criticized Acting Mayor Janey for her initial defense of such exams. After Janey changed her position, Campbell criticized her for being late to address the matter.\n\n, Campbell served on several council committees, including Community Preservation Act, Public Safety & Criminal Justice, Rules and Administration, and .\n\nCampbell did not run for reelection to the council , as she instead opted to run for mayor.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn September 24, 2020, Campbell announced her candidacy in the 2021 Boston mayoral election from her childhood home in Roxbury. In an announcement video that was released, she declared, \"I'm running for mayor, because every neighborhood deserves real change and a real chance.\" Campbell's mayoral campaign launch followed the launch of her council colleague Michelle Wu's own campaign for mayor earlier that month.\n\nDuring her campaign, Campbell was critical of Acting Mayor Kim Janey, who was also a candidate in the election. Campbell worked to illustrate a strong contrast between herself and Janey. Campbell held s criticizing Janey on various topics, including urging her to release legal documents related to a police scandal and to make greater cuts to the city's police department budget. In early August, Campbell called for Janey to put in place rules which would require that many businesses require patrons provide proof of vaccination. Campbell also criticized Janey for having, per her criticism, waited too long to put in place a vaccine mandate for city employees.\n\nCampbell received the endorsement of '''''s .\n\nCampbell's campaign platform included a proposal to reallocate ten percent of the Boston Police Department's budget ($50 million) to other programs matters related to public health, economic justice, and youth issues. She also proposed removing the Boston Public Schools' 125 s and reutilizing those funds to pay for more mental health specialists.\n\nAhead of the primary election, a  associated with  Local 26, supporting Kim Janey's candidacy, ran a    against Campbell which attacked her past support for charter school expansion, and which alleged that Campbell was \"supported by special interests that want to take money from our schools, and give it to other schools that discriminate against kids with special needs\". The latter accusation was seen as alluding to the fact that a super PAC supporting Campbell's candidacy received funding from wealthy charter school proponents, such as . Campbell publicly took issue with the characterization of her in this ad, and urged Janey to disavow it, which Janey did not. Janey's campaign manager accused Campbell of being a , characterizing Campbell's campaign as being entirely, \"based on negative political attacks on Mayor Janey\".\n\nCampbell delivered a  speech on the night of the nonpartisan mayoral , despite extremely little of the vote having yet been officially reported. Once the votes were fully reported, Campbell had finished third in the primary, meaning that she did not advance to the general election.\n\nFollowing her loss, Campbell stated that she would have a publicly transparent process in contemplating which general election candidate ( or ) to endorse, if any. She stated that she would seek firm commitments to the  community to be made by any candidate she might endorsed. She ultimately gave no endorsement to either remaining candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn February 2, 2022, Campbell announced her candidacy for  in the 2022 election. Campbell's announcement came after incumbent attorney general  announced that she would not seek reelection and run for  instead.\n\nCampbell's inclusion on the ballot for the election's Democratic primary made her the first black woman in the history of Massachusetts to qualify for inclusion on the ballot for election to statewide office. Healey endorsed Campbell in August, prior to the primary election. Campbell won the Democratic nomination and, in the general election, was elected to serve as attorney general. She is the first black woman to hold the office, and the second black person to hold the office, after only . Other focuses of her platform included addressing  as well as housing-related matters.\n\nAs a candidate, Campbell pledged to approach the position through what she dubbed an \"equity lens\". She pledged that she would use the office to address matters such as disparities of health and economics negatively impacting the rural parts of the state , and juvenile justice. She promised that she would seek to ensure that nobody would be treated as \"above the law\". She also promised to revive public faith in the criminal justice system. Campbell made  a focus of her candidacy. Campbell also made addressing  one of the focuses of her campaign. Among the positions she staked out was a promise to end the practice of . Campbell's Republican opponent, Jay McMahon, attempted to paint her as being \"soft\" on crime. After the '''' decision by the  overturned the federal protections of  rights that had been previously protected by the '''' decision, Campbell pledged that as attorney general she would establish a  unit under the Office of the Attorney General.\n\n\n\nCampbell won the November general election 62.6% to 37.4%. In early December, Campbell announced that she had established a committee to facilitate her end of the Attorney General's Office's transition of leadership. Campbell took office on January 18, 2023.

Earlier that month, the town's voters had voted in a  against adopting new zoning that would allow multifamily housing in the manner that the law requires. Proponents of the referendum contended that municipalities have the final authority on such zoning matters, not the state. Campbell's suit challenges this contention. The municipal government of Milton opposes Campbell's lawsuit. She has requested for the  to hear the matter.\n\n\n]]\n\nWhile Campbell stands by her personal opposition to qualified immunity, within months of taking office she had backed away from her promise of ending it, viewing such a pursuit as detrimental to the working relationship her office needs to maintain with law enforcement officials.\n\nIn a June 2023 filing with the , Campbell advised that it would be wiser to grant only a much smaller procurement of  than Governor Healey had requested approval from the department to procure. Campbell argued that the a 20-year contract to procure energy should be for a smaller amount of power than Healey was proposing, arguing that it was unwise to make an agreement for larger purchase at a time when prices for offshore wind power had increased.\n\n\n\nIn February 2024, Campbell announced that the state of Massachusetts would receive $8 million from a national $350 million multi-state national  with  over that company's role in the .\n\nIn May 2023, Campbell announced that the Attorney General's Office was probing allegations of  within the gang unit and gang database of the Boston Police Department.\n\nIn April 2024, Campbell had the state of Massachusetts join a multi-state lawsuit seeking to reinstate protections for  individuals and other vulnerable populations.

The district primarily includes parts of  and also includes parts of  and .\n\n\nMoore grew up in  and attended Sequoyah High School.  Moore graduated from  in 2000 with a degree in Computer Science.  After graduating, he worked in the computer industry in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area.  In 2013 he retired from the computer industry.\n\n\n\n\nThe sitting house district 22 representative, Calvin Hill, died from Leukemia on October 30, 2013 and a special election was called for January 7, 2014.  On November 20, 2013, Sam Moore qualified to run for the state house district 22 along with 3 other candidates – Meagan Biello, Jeff Duncan and Nate Cochran.\nMoore won a plurality of the special election with 38 percent of the 2,433 votes cast.  Meagan Biello came in second with 24 percent of the vote.  Moore defeated Biello at the runoff with 57.7 percent of the 2,632 votes cast on February 4, 2014 after running a campaign on fighting for liberty and fighting corruption in the Georgia State Government.\n\n\nMoore was sworn into the Georgia House of Representatives on February 11, 2014.  By the time he was sworn in, the Legislative session was half over and \"Crossover Day\" on March 3, 2014 was rapidly approaching.  During his short tenure as part of the , Sam Moore authored or cosponsored 15 different bills and 3 house resolutions.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, February 19, 2014, Moore introduced House Bill 1033 which repealed Georgia's Loitering Laws.  However, by removing the Georgia loitering laws, the bill also removed restrictions on Sex Offenders from loitering near schools and playgrounds.\n\nOn Friday February 21, 2014, an article was printed in the '''' discussing HB 1033. In that article Mr. Moore admitted to turning in a bill that made it legal for \"registered sex offenders who aren't otherwise barred from going to schools or places children gather (so that sex offenders) could go to those places freely.\" Representative Moore was quoted in the article as saying, \"I am OK with that...Am I saying it's not creepy? It's definitely creepy.\" Cherokee Sheriff Roger Garrison called the bill \"simply insane.\" and went on to say, \"In my 34 years of law enforcement I have never heard of such an insane law having been introduced,\" Garrison said Friday. \"Sexual predators are one of this country's most violent (type of) offenders. If there's any equal it would be an out-and-out serial killer.\"\n\nOn Friday February 21, 2014, the Republican Leadership publicly denounced HB 1033.  The speaker of the house,  stated \"The Republican majority in the House chose to stand with Georgia's families and with children. That bill chooses to stand with sex offenders and pedophiles. And that's something that I can't fathom.\"  Moore defended his bill stating: \"There's already laws on the books to handle everything that I've heard thus far as far as child molesters or whatever they're worried about attacking children, or whatever; there's already existing laws for that.  This is kind of a vague blanket law that applies to everyone, so I didn't see a problem with removing it, and until I hear something specific I still don't have a problem.\"\n\nOn Monday, February 24, 2014, Sam Moore withdrew his bill and publicly apologized for his bill in what the Atlanta Journal And Constitution described as \"an extraordinary speech delivered on the House floor.\"  Moore stated \"In hindsight, this rookie mistake was silly.  I am mature enough to admit that. At the time though, I believed that I was fulfilling a campaign promise to hit the ground running.\"\n\nAccording to current Georgia Law, O.C.G.A. 16-11-36, Title 20, Section 20-2-1180: Child Protection Act, 42-1-15, , 42-1-14 Sexual Offender Registry. According to 20-2-1180  upon school premises or within a school safety zone: Parents of children attending Georgia School's are not allowed to be on school property, without first checking into the front office. The law clearly defines, in Section A thru F, that the facilitators of the school are directed to demand that any unauthorized person leave school grounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He served as the chairperson of the transportation committee and chaired on the Public Safety and Legal Administration Committee.\n\n\nMayor Andre Dickens was the chief development officer for Tech Bridge; this non-profit offers affordable technology and business expertise to other nonprofits in underserved areas. In 2018, Dickens co-founded a Technology Career Program for the unemployed to be able to learn new tech skills and other IT training to take advantage of the booming tech jobs market. Mayor Andre Dickens also serves on the Georgia Tech Alumni Board, the Alumnus Leadership Atlanta, Diversity Leadership Atlanta, United Way VI, and Regional Leadership Institute.

He has one daughter, Bailey.\n\n\nDickens was born in 1974, in Atlanta. Raised by his mother Sylvia Dickens and stepfather who adopted him and his other two siblings at the age of 7. While spending time with his step-father they often bonded over taking things apart and rebuilding them which birthed Dickens' passion for engineering. He grew up in Southwest Atlanta, and attended  before enrolling at the , where he received his degree in chemical engineering in 1998. Dickens received his Master's of Public Administration in Economic Development from .\n\n\nWhile enrolled at Georgia Tech, Andre Dickens began his professional career in 1994 as a part-time chemical engineer for BP-Amoco. Immediately after getting his degree, the position at BP-Amoco became full-time. In 1999, Dickens was employed at DSM Engineering and Plastics where he was a sales engineer. As a sales engineer, his contribution to the company were recognized as he was named the first Black salesman of the year. Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/mayor-s-office/meet-the-mayor |access-date=2022-11-30 |website=www.atlantaga.gov |language=en}} After his time spent as a sales engineer at twenty-eight years old Dickens alongside his older sister co-founded City-Living Home Furnishing. The furnishing company was around for nine years from 2002 to 2011 and became a multi-million dollar business in only two locations. Unfortunately due to the housing crisis Dickens was unable to keep the company alive and in 2010 he filed for Chapter Seven bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2013 Andre Dickens, was elected as an at-large City Council member. From 2014 to 2021 he mainly advocated for the improvement of Atlanta's public safety, the need for affordable housing, having programs for citizens, and creating more opportunities to students in Atlanta's Public School system. Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/mayor-s-office/meet-the-mayor |access-date=2022-12-05 |website=www.atlantaga.gov |language=en}} One of his most important contributions to the city while on city council was his sponsorship of legislation that made the minimum wage for city employees fifteen dollars an hour. In addition to changing the minimum wage he created the Department of Transportation, the BeltLine Inclusionary Zoning which increased affordable housing in the area, and the Atlanta Youth Commission.\n\n\n\n in December 2021]]\nOn February 25, 2022, Dickens lifted the indoor  mask mandate in Atlanta, ending a near 2 year restriction on restaurants, hotels, and other venues.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Mayor Andre Dickens made one of Atlanta's largest-ever, single-housing investments, committing more than $100 million to new and updated housing. The Dickens administration continues to partner with and leverage tools such as inclusionary zoning to assist with this investment. In order to offer affordable housing alongside increasing interest rates, new developments in areas with major public interest such as Westside Park and the BeltLine will take precedence. Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/mayor-s-office/meet-the-mayor |access-date=2022-12-04 |website=www.atlantaga.gov |language=en}}\n with Mayor Dickens in May 2023]]\nMayor Dickens' early accomplishments in office include the city's first-ever investment in early childhood education and the creation of a Nightlife Division to combat establishments with a history of violent crime.\n\nDuring Mayor Dickens' term, over $13 million in funding has been set aside to combat homelessness, with the help of the LIFT 2.0 homeless response plan. By the end of 2024, the City hopes to achieve its goal of providing 1,500 housing placements for impoverished families by collaborating with local government, corporations, nonprofits, and community members.\n\nIn October 2022, Mayor Andre Dickens appointed Darin Schierbaum as Atlanta's 26th Chief of Atlanta Police Department\n\nDickens condemned the , saying Israel \"has the right to defend itself.\"\n\n\nDickens has supported the city's funding the construction of a controversial police and fire department training center, dubbed \"\" by environmentalists and community activists.\n\nIn June 2020, Dickens voted to withhold $73 million in police funding, which was criticized by a former Atlanta mayoral campaign opponent as Mayor Dickens' attempt to contribute to the \"low morale within the Atlanta Police Department.\"\n\nAmid controversy, more than 1,300 climate, justice, and community groups urged the resignation of Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens due to his perceived support for law enforcement following the police killing of anti-\"Cop City\" activist Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán on January 18, 2023. The groups expressed strong disapproval of Dickens' refusal to condemn the killing and criticized his alignment with law enforcement, particularly in the context of Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp deploying the National Guard to quell protests, escalating tensions and threats against demonstrators. Dickens stated protests as unpeaceful while non Georgia residents were arrested on domestic terrorism for traveling into the state with explosives as a means to protest the construction site of a new public safety training center  dubbed “Cop City.” \n\nIn September 2023, Dickens expressed a commitment to prioritize residents' voices in the citywide vote on a $90 million police training facility. However, his administration faced criticism for not moving forward with the signature verification process, prompting concerns raised by Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., particularly regarding the practice's past criticism by Georgia Democrats. As of September 2023 activists had turned in more than 116,000 signatures in an effort to get a referendum on the ballot regarding the future of the planned training facility.\n\n\nIn 2022, the  (OIG) determined nearly $121,000 used for Dickens Senior Citizen Ball celebrating Atlanta's residents 65 and older, did not follow procurement guidelines, ultimately using taxpayers dollars to fund the party. The OIG has referred its findings to the City of Atlanta Ethics Office for review of potential violations of the city's Ethics Code. The Office of Mayor Dickens responded to the OIG report by saying they are committed to compliance with rules and regulations and would ensure to follow proper procedures for the 2023 Senior Ball. Dickens also said he intended to reimburse the city for hotel room costs for himself and his family, the report said.\n\n\nIn relation to Atlanta's housing policy, critics have raised concerns about the initial plans for the Civic Center, citing them as 'far too little deeply affordable housing.' This refers to homes priced for households earning less than half of the area median income. Furthermore, housing advocates have expressed the need for additional anti-discrimination safeguards in the new resolution, particularly regarding renters using Section 8 vouchers, to prevent landlords from refusing to rent to them. In response to these issues, Mayor Dickens faced criticism for advocating a change in the law that would require the Georgia Legislature to revise statewide laws. These laws currently prohibit local governments from enacting fair housing laws that are more expansive than the state's regulations.\n\nIn February 2023, Mayor Dickens struck a deal between the city's housing authority and developer Integral Group, calling for the housing authority to sell 81 acres to develop affordable housing units.\n\nIn May 2022, Mayor Dickens faced criticism from housing advocates when his initial budget proposal omitted a contribution to the \"Building the Beloved Community Affordable Housing Trust Fund.\" Responding to the backlash, he later announced a $7 million addition to the proposed budget, increasing the total affordable housing investment from $58.7 million to about $65 million.\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA member of the Democratic party, Andre Dickens first served for the Atlanta city council in 2013. In 2017, as an incumbent he ran unopposed in the general election for the At-Large Post 3 seat for city council. After two terms on city council, Andre ran for mayor of Atlanta. Throughout his campaign he captured numerous endorsements ranging from state senators to local influential leaders in the community. Dickens captured 23% of the vote in the general election to edge Kasim Reed for the second spot in the runoff race. Although Dickens did not win the 2021 Atlanta mayoral primary election (coming in second place), he won the following runoff election by a wide margin. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was reelected twice, in both  and . In Worcester, which has a hybrid city council/city manager form of government, the mayor is directly elected by the voting public and is considered the political leader of the city. The mayor is, by charter, chair of the city council and chair of the School Committee, overseeing the city's 23,000-student public school system. The mayor appoints the membership of city council committees and directs the council's meetings. The mayor is not the chief executive of the city; that power rests with the city manager, who is appointed by the city council.\n\nAs mayor, Murray promoted brownfields redevelopment, expanded commuter rail service and economic development. Through public advocacy, he helped to launch the largest downtown redevelopment project in the city's recent history, known as the City Square project, which involved redevelopment of a failed shopping mall on some 20 prime acres in the core of downtown Worcester.

He was the Chairman of the Governor's Advisory Council on Veterans Services which works to provide benefits and services to members of the military and their families and secure federal grants for housing and services for veterans; he was also Chairman of the Seaport Advisory Council which works to enhance the economic development of the ports of Massachusetts and has invested millions of dollars in improvements for the ports; he was also Chairman of the Interagency Council on Housing and Homelessness working to end homelessness in Massachusetts and implement \"housing first\" reforms to keep families and individuals from needing to go into shelter in the first place.\n   \nDuring this time, Murray also served as the Chairman of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Advisory Council, working to stress the importance of these areas of education to compete in the global marketplace. As Chairman of the STEM Council, Murray worked to provide students with real world experience in STEM using public-private partnerships.\n[\n\n's ]]\n\nAs the point person for Governor Patrick on passenger rail and freight service, Murray spearheaded the negotiations with CSX for an agreement  to move their current rail yard from Boston to Worcester, thereby freeing up some 80 prime riverfront acres in Boston for redevelopment;  increase passenger train service on the Worcester/Framingham line; open a Transflo facility in Westborough for intermodal shipping; and refurbish bridges on the rail lines in western Massachusetts to allow for double stacked trains to move all the way across the state without stopping.\n \nAs the Chairman of the Military Asset and Security Strategy Task Force, Murray worked to protect and promote Massachusetts military installations and the businesses associated with them.  Last year Massachusetts received over $13.9 billion in federal contracts for industries related to national defense.\n\nOn April 2, 2010, Governor Patrick and Murray confirmed they would run for re-election. On June 5, 2010, they were endorsed by Democrats at the Massachusetts Democratic Party Convention. Both faced no other Democratic challengers. Other gubernatorial candidates in the 2010 election included Republican , Independent , and Green/Rainbow . The election took place on November 2, 2010, and Patrick and Murray were re-elected with 48.4% of the vote.\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor checked himself into St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester on July 5, 2010, after feeling chest pains. He had marched in five parades over the weekend for Independence Day celebrations in 90-degree heat.

From 2010 onwards, he was also its 73rd Speaker of the House. Ralston was the longest-serving Republican Speaker in state history and the longest-serving Speaker of the Georgia General Assembly since .\n\n\nDavid Ralston was born in . He attended , graduated from , and later from the .\n\nFrom 1992 to 1998, he served as a member of the . In 1998, Ralston was the Republican nominee for , but lost the election to . In 2002, he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives for the 7th district. He was elected to serve as Speaker in 2010, following the resignation of .Aaron Gould Sheinin, 'Republicans back Ralston for speaker', in '''', December 17, 2009  As such, he is the first state House Speaker from north Georgia in more than 150 years.Ashley Fielding, 'State leaders put North Ga. in seat of power', in '''', January 10, 2010 \n\n\n\nRalston spearheaded economically conservative initiatives, including passing the first-ever income tax cut in the state in 2018  and eliminating the sales tax on manufacturers. In the wake of the , Ralston led the effort to pass a state hate-crimes law. Additionally, Ralston passed reforms to Georgia's election process, most recently the . Although Ralston and Republicans said these efforts were to increase voter security within the state, critics said that they are intended to disenfranchise voters and lower turnout.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Ralston was investigated by the  following a complaint that he had ignored a client's case for years and had failed to communicate. In 2016, Ralston and the  reached a settlement, with the Georgia Bar issuing a minor reprimand and Ralston admitting to inadvertently breaking State Bar rules, ending a years-long dispute. He had previously faced disbarment.\n\n\nIn February 2019, the '''' and  reported that Ralston regularly used his position as speaker to benefit his -based private law practice. A 1905 state law ( § 17-8-26) requires judges and prosecutors to defer to the schedules of any member of the general assembly who is also a practicing lawyer, and as speaker, Ralston was able to claim scheduling conflicts any time of year. By delaying court cases in this manner, Ralston was able to keep his clients free on bond for months or even years, while weakening court cases over time by letting memories fade and evidence expire. Some of Ralston's clients retained him specifically for these reasons.\n\nJournalists found that over the course of 21 cases, Ralston requested delays 57 times, and that on 76 of the 93 conflicting days, the legislature was not in session; he would commonly delay individual cases over a dozen times each. Charges against Ralston's clients who benefited from this include , , and assault.\n\nIn April 2019, an independent researcher reviewed Ralston's court cases across eight counties and found that from 2010 through 2019, Ralston delayed 226 cases a total of 966 times. Multiple attorneys wrote formal complaints to various judges regarding Ralston's delays. In response, Ralston said that the researcher \"does not understand the legal system or the criminal justice system... [and] didn't have anything critical to say about my performance as speaker.\"\n\nThe original law allowing this was amended over a century later in 2006 by SB 503. Previously, the law allowed representatives to delay court hearings only during the legislative session and for the following three weeks. A committee was formed to reconcile differences between the house and senate versions of SB 503, and Ralston himself was named a member. His exact role in crafting the current law's language is unknown.\n\nLittle to no pushback from judges has been found. Ralston had been known to seek revenge on political opponents and, as speaker, controlled two seats on the investigative panel of the state judicial qualifications commission. Further, the Georgia legislature made itself exempt from the Georgia Open Records Act.\n\n\nIn response, Ralston stated that he would \"continue to represent the people of the 7th House district, and... continue being speaker of the House.\" He also lashed out at reporters, saying the media is interested in \"profit[,] not truth.\"\n\nOn February 22, after more than a week of relative silence from both Republican and Democratic lawmakersdue to what the ''AJC'' calls \"a reluctance seemingly rooted in Ralston's substantial political power\"state representative  of  (98th district) introduced a resolution in the Georgia house (HR 328) calling on Ralston to resign as speaker, saying he felt \"betrayed\" and stating that Ralston \"absolutely abused his power. He used his seat, and he's hurting people.\" Out of 180 total members, just nine other state representatives, all Republicans, signed Clark's resolution:\n\n* (, 20th district)\n* (, 18th district)\n* (, 24th district)\n* (, 8th district)\n*Jeff Jones (, 167th district)\n* (, 1st district)\n*Ken Pullin (, 131st district)\n*David Stover (, 71st district)\n*Scot Turner (, 21st district)\n\nGurtler told the ''AJC'' to \"remember that legality and morality don't always align;\" Moore wrote a letter to Ralston stating that \"District 1 and many citizens across our great state believe you should no longer serve as the leader of Georgia's largest governing body\"; Pullin said Ralston's \"actions may be legal according to state law, but they're not ethical or moral;\" Turner stated that he felt \"compelled by a sense of duty to call for the speaker to put the gavel down.\"\n\n representative  (73rd district) initially signed the resolution, but later removed her signature.\n\nLocal Republican conventions in DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Rabun counties called for Ralston to resign, as did the ''Gainesville Times''.\n\nMeanwhile, politicians from both sides of the aisle defended Ralston. The governor's office said governor  looks forward to working with Ralston. , Georgia senate , said that Ralston \"[goes] above and beyond as a citizen legislator.\" Former Republican governor  said he knows Ralston is \"an honorable person,\" and former Democratic governor  stated it was \"foolhardy to call for [Ralston's] resignation.\"\n\nMany other state representatives expressed support for Ralston; after the allegations surfaced, at a closed-door meeting of Republicans at the Capitol, Ralston received a \"spontaneous\" round of applause. House   of  (16th district) stated \"[i]t's really unfair to the speaker, because he also has a pretty important duty and an absolute right of privilege that exists between him and his client.\" Speaker pro tem  of  (47th district) called Ralston a \"man of integrity.\"  of  (4th district) said Ralston \"operated within the confines of the law. If you don't like the law, let's change the law.\"  representative  (3rd district) said, \"I hate that this is all coming about... This takes away from us doing and concentrating on the people's needs.\"\n\n representatives  (30th district) and  (27th district) both said they were withholding judgment for now.\n\nConservative commentators were less supportive, with former radio host  declaring that Ralston should face ethics charges, and  radio host  said Republicans \"[enabled] this and [let] it happen.\"\n\nThe  released a statement declaring that \"Speaker Ralston has abused his power as a public servant to delay and deny justice for crime victims,\" while former gubernatorial candidate  was more restrained, saying that she would \"leave it to Speaker Ralston to determine if he's meeting his obligations both as an attorney and as a legislator.\"\n\n\nOn February 25, 2019, Ralston declared in an \"emotional\" speech to the Georgia house that he would establish a bipartisan panel to look into how the law should be changed; he also stated that as an attorney, he would not accept any new criminal cases for now. Ralston's speech received a standing ovation. Representative Scot Turner applauded the move to change the law, but said that Ralston still has \"a lack of recognition that his actions have caused people harm.\"\n\nThe panel returned a draft law which would allow attorneys and their clients to oppose similar requests for leave, leaving it to the judge to determine the best course of action. The draft was introduced as House Bill 502 and it became law on May 7, 2019. Speaking to the ''Augusta Chronicle'', Ralston said that \"to the extent there's a perception that's a problem, then I think we've dealt with it.\" However, the ''AJC'' reported skepticism of the new law due to the fact that \"judges have already had the ability to push back on the speaker, but rarely did\".\n\n\n\nDuring the 2020 U.S. coronavirus pandemic, Ralston strongly opposed expanding use of mail-in ballots, under the reasoning that it would increase turnout, the possibility of fraud, and hurt Republican candidates. According to Ralston, \"This will be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia. Every registered voter is going to get one of these. … This will certainly drive up turnout.\"\n\nRalston later clarified that his concerns were strictly about the likelihood of fraud: \"It’s really not a question about higher turnout... It’s just that the election needs to be secure and it must have integrity. If it doesn’t, I think our chances obviously are problematic.”\n\n\nRalston had two children and worked as an attorney in . He was married to Sheree Ralston, and was a member of the Fannin County  and the Blue Ridge Mountains Arts Association.\n\nOn November 4, 2022, Ralston announced he would not seek another term as house speaker, citing health concerns.

In 2014 Wolf was re-elected to his third term, defeating Republican Ron Beaty in the general election.\n\nIn October 2015,  first reported that Wolf was considering not running for re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016.

After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 to focus on a  began circulating, Senate President  suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.\n\n\nDespite being elected from a relatively  district, Wolf has emerged as a  and  member of the Senate.

Wolf, along with  in the , introduced the \"2013 Earned Paid Sick Time\" bill, which would allow employees to one hour of paid sick leave for every thirty worked. To generate support among other senators, Wolf went so far as to hold a protest with workers' rights activists at a  frequented by legislators. While advocating for the bill in a committee hearing, Wolf admitted \"it never occurred to me that there were that many businesses out there that didn't offer this as a benefit,\" and referred to the experience as \"an eye-opener.\" Although the proposal eventually expired without being passed, for reasons Wolf described as a compromise with the  having already passed an incremental  increase, he campaigned for a  in 2014 which would mandate universal employee sick time.\n\nAs the senator for , Wolf supports , a project to build an offshore  in .

In a statement to supporters, explaining that departing his company or canceling contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign from the Senate.\n\nThe Ethics Commission later granted his campaign a reprieve, allowing Wolf to make an appeal at their next scheduled meeting on September 19. At the meeting, the Commission ruled 4–1 to reverse its decision which disqualified him from public office, allowing him to remain in office and renew his candidacy Governor. On October 21, Wolf announced he was ending his campaign for governor, due to the fact that even though the Ethics Commission voted to change its rules, the implementation would have likely taken several months.

Totaling $1.5 billion, this law included the largest increase in education funding in Massachusetts’ history. Signed into law in 2019, the Student Opportunity Act adjusted the formula used by the state to calculate the cost of educating students by updating costs related to health care, , , and programs for low-income students. The act also encourages schools districts to use additional funds on programs to support students’ \"social-emotional and physical health,\" in line with Spilka's longstanding support for social-emotional learning.\n\nAfter having been delayed due to the , the Student Opportunity Act will be phased in starting in 2022.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the , Spilka announced the creation of a racial justice advisory group led by Massachusetts Senators  and  to draft legislation in response to , which was subsequently passed and signed into law by Governor . This sweeping police reform law, ''An Act relative to justice, equity and accountability in law enforcement in the Commonwealth'', is notable for pioneering multiple novel approaches to police reform. The law created a first-in-the-nation  to standardize the certification and decertification of police officers, with the power to conduct independent investigations into police misconduct, and also created the first state-wide restriction on law enforcement's use of  in the United States. The bill furthermore banned the use of s and created a duty to intervene for police officers when witnessing another officer using force inappropriately. The law was hailed as 'robust' by commentators, including the  Director of Racial Justice, who noted that it created \"probably the strongest\" police oversight commission in the country.\n\nIn recognition of these and other actions to advance equity and  in Massachusetts, Spilka was awarded the  Advocacy Award by the New England Area Conference of the  in 2020.\n\n\nIn 2022, Spilka released a statement saying that the Massachusetts Senate did not \"see a path forward\" for efforts by Senate staffers to unionize. Staffers have been seeking recognition after announcing their intention to unionize earlier that year and denounced the response as anti-union.\n\n\n\n\n\n* at the Massachusetts Legislature\n* constituency site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Murphy had run for reelection unopposed in 2014 and 2016.\n\nLamb was selected as the Democratic nominee at a convention in November 2017. In the general election, he faced Republican State Representative . Despite the district's Republican bent, the special election was considered highly competitive and attracted national attention. National Republican sources spent more than $8 million on television advertising, twice as much as the Democrats. Several prominent Republicans, including President ,   and Trump's children  and , visited the district to campaign for Saccone.\n\nDuring the campaign, Republicans accused Lamb of having a \"weak record\" as a prosecutor.  examined the Republicans' claims, calling them \"flimsy and misleading\".\n\nOn the topic of guns, Lamb called for \"a stronger system of background checks but no new restrictions\".

On Wednesday afternoon, ''The New York Times'' followed suit after concluding that Lamb's lead, while narrow, appeared \"insurmountable\". However, most news outlets did not declare a result, noting the closeness of the vote (just 0.2% separated the candidates) and the likelihood of a recount. However, when it became apparent that Saccone would not pick up enough votes to overtake Lamb, he called Lamb to concede the race on March 21.\n\nLamb's lead came primarily on the strength of winning the Allegheny County portion of the district by almost 15,400 votes.

The district had lost much of its eastern portion, centered around , becoming a more compact district northwest of Pittsburgh. In the process, the district lost its connection to longtime congressman , who represented it from 1974 to 2010. While the old 12th was one of Trump's strongest districts in Pennsylvania in 2016, Trump would have only barely carried the new 17th. The new 17th also voted for Democrats in downballot races. This led to speculation that Lamb would run for a full term in the new 17th, regardless of the special election results.\n\nOn March 14,  Democratic Party chairman Stephen Dupree told  that Lamb submitted a written request for county Democrats to endorse his bid for the 17th in the November 2018 general election; Beaver County is entirely within the new 17th. On March 16, Lamb announced on his  account that he was in the process of gathering petitions for a run in the 17th. On March 20, he formally submitted petitions for a full term in the 17th. He was unopposed in the May 15 primary and defeated Rothfus in the general election.\n\n\n\nLamb won re-election, defeating Republican Sean Parnell, an Army veteran and Trump supporter.

Both parents came from fourth-generation South Boston families. He attended St. Augustine Elementary School and . During high school vacations he began working in construction alongside his father. After graduating from high school in 1973, Lynch became an apprentice . For the next six years he worked on high-altitude structural ironwork throughout the country for various companies, including  and .\n\nIn 1977 Lynch was arrested for smoking  at a  concert at the , leading to a $50  fine. In 1979 he was arrested for assault and battery of six ian students attending an anti-American protest in Boston, a charge that was later dropped. Around this time, he developed \"a problem with alcohol\", leading him to join . (He reportedly left AA after meeting his future wife several years later, but continued to attend occasional meetings through the 2000s.)\n\nHaving personal experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch developed aspirations beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in  to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at the . Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s, he was elected to the executive board of the  union. At age 30, he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the , from which he graduated '''' with a  in construction management in 1988.\n\nThat year Lynch led a three-week labor strike, refusing to sign a contract with the Associated General Contractors  despite pressure from within his union. The union international ultimately signed the contract without Lynch's approval, causing him to file suit against them. He later remarked, \"Nothing I ever do will be as volatile as being union president during those times.\" The incident forced him to miss the first three weeks of classes at , where he had enrolled.

Dumont, Jr., representing labor unions and unemployed workers.\n\nThroughout law school and the following years, he often worked ''pro bono'', representing housing project residents at  (BHA) hearings. In one high-profile 1994 case, Lynch provided free legal services to 14 teenagers, all white, who were accused of physically attacking a Hispanic teenager and harassing the family of his white girlfriend over a period of six months. Lynch claimed the youths had been \"overcharged\" and helped some of them avoid criminal charges and eviction by the BHA.\n\nLynch was a onetime tax delinquent. In the mid-1980s the city of Boston placed liens on four properties he owned due to several thousand dollars of unpaid property taxes. He owed Massachusetts $2,000 in overdue taxes from 1985 to 1988, and for several years owed the  $4,000.\n\n\n\nWith numerous cases under his belt, Lynch developed a reputation in his community, and friends encouraged him to run for office. In early 1994 he phoned , the Democratic  from the  district, to announce a run against him. While both candidates were labor advocates with similar backgrounds, Lynch called himself \"the conservative candidate\". He criticized Gannon for not supporting the Veterans Council, which had prevented a gay rights group from marching in the local St. Patrick's Day Parade. Lynch's base of supporters in the projects allowed him to win the Democratic primary by 600 votes before he went on win the general election.\n\nAs a state representative, Lynch was a vocal advocate for his neighborhood.

Bulger's son, attorney William M. Bulger, Jr., also ran for the seat, as did another lawyer, Patrick Loftus. The race grew from the grassroots of South Boston, with neighborhood issues such as development, crime, and education ruling the debate. The candidates declared their mutual respect. Lynch won the March 1996 primary, defeating Bulger Jr. and Loftus 56%–35%–9%. In April, he defeated Republican Richard William Czubinski 96%–4%, and he was inaugurated on May 1, 1996.

The remaining candidates included eight Democrats and two Republicans. All the remaining candidates had similar political positions and according to ''The Boston Globe'', the candidates \"struggled to find areas of conflict\" when debating.\n\nLynch's main opponents in the primary were State Senators ,  and . During the campaign, Lynch faced criticism as his past improprieties were uncovered, including two arrests, defaulting on student loans, and a history of tax delinquency.

She graduated from  in 1975.\n\nShe earned a  degree in  from the  in 1979 and worked in an education reform commission under Texas Governor  and as associate executive director for the Texas Association of School Boards. Before her appointment to George W. Bush's presidential administration, Spellings was the political director for Bush's first gubernatorial campaign in 1994, and later became a senior advisor to Bush during his Texas governorship from 1995 to 2000.\n\n\n\nFollowing 's departure as Secretary of Education, Spellings was nominated to that position by President George W. Bush on November 17, 2004, confirmed by the  on January 20, 2005, which also marked the beginning of Bush's second presidential term, and ceremonially sworn in on January 31 the same year. She was the  of Education.\n\n\n\nOn January 21, 2005, one day after being confirmed as Secretary of Education, Spellings wrote a letter to the  warning the network not to air an episode of the children's program ''''. In that episode, the animated bunny Buster visits Vermont to learn about  production and meets real-life children who have  parents.  The children tell Buster they have a \"mom and stepmom.\" A child explains that one of the women is her stepmother whom she loves. No other comment is made about the family.Lisa de Moraes.   (TV column), ''Washington Post'', January 27, 2005.\n\nSpellings's letter reminded , CEO of PBS, that ''Postcards from Buster'' was funded in part by the Department of Education and \"that many parents would not want their young children exposed to the life-styles portrayed in the episode.\" PBS decided not to distribute the episode, but , the public television station in , said it would air it and offered it to any station \"willing to defy the Education Department.\"\n\n, a writer for ''Arthur'' (from which that program was spun-off), later wrote a play titled ''Dusty and the Big Bad World'', based on the controversy.\n\nIn a 2022 statement about the show's 25th and final season, Spellings told  that \"the world is very different today\" and that the government \"now reflects a greater openness to the multi-faceted, diverse stories that Americans can tell about themselves, their lives, and the country we share.\"\n\n\n is seated at the right]]\n\nIn April 2005, on PBS's '''', she called  resistance to the  the \"soft bigotry of low expectations\". According to the program's transcript, she said:\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2007, Spellings testified before the  responding to criticism from New York Attorney General  that the Education Department had been \"asleep at the switch\" in overseeing student loan programs, allowing corruption and conflicts of interest to spread. Spellings has further gone on record to say that she is disregarding the suggestion by the Inspector General to hold the loan companies accountable for their graft.\n\nAltha Cravey and Robert Siegel wrote in the ''News & Observer'' that Spellings had been \"supporting for-profit colleges who prey on students – and then profiting off those same students when they default on their loans.\" Spellings served on the board of directors for the Apollo Group, the parent company of the for-profit , which paid her more than $300,000.\"\", by Valerie Strauss, ''Washington Post'', November 14, 2015. .\n\n\nIn September 2005, Spellings announced the formation of the Secretary of Education's , which has also been referred to as the Spellings Commission. The commission was charged with recommending a national strategy for reforming post-secondary education, with a particular focus on how well colleges and universities were preparing students for the 21st-century workplace. Controversial recommendations included a call for colleges and universities to focus on training students for the workforce and supporting research with commercial applications.\n\nIt had a secondary focus on how well high schools were preparing students for post-secondary education. Spellings described the work of the commission as a natural extension into higher education of the reforms carried out under No Child Left Behind, and is quoted as saying: \"It's time we turn this elephant around and upside down and take a look at it.\"\n\n\nAfter leaving her role as Secretary of Education, she founded Margaret Spellings & Company, an education consulting firm in  She was a senior advisor to the  and the . Spellings is currently co-chair of the Future of Tech Commission alongside  of , an organization that focuses on technology and privacy policy.\n\n\n\nOn October 23, 2015, Spellings was elected as the president of the  system by the board of governors, effective March 1, 2016. She succeeded , who was fired by the Board of Governors in a controversial move that some believed was motivated by politics. She is the second woman to serve as president of the University of North Carolina. In her role as president, she oversaw the seventeen constituent institutions that make up the UNC system, each having its own chancellor that serves as the chief executive on the local campus. Her base salary was $775,000.\n\n\nSpellings's election as president of the university was controversial because of the way the secretive search process was conducted. At the Board of Governors meeting at which she was selected, several faculty attempted to read a statement before being escorted out by campus police. Over 100 faculty protestors outside the room shouted loud enough to be heard through the closed doors. According to the protestors, Spellings represented \"everything that is troubling in the direction of public higher education in this country.\" \"Faculty leaders said they were ignored during the process.\" Outgoing President Ross described the environment Spellings was entering as \"hostile\". On her first day, March 1, 2016, students and faculty walked out of their classes on six campuses. In Chapel Hill, demonstrators gathered on the steps of .\n\nSeveral board of governors members called on Board Chairman John Fennebresque to resign for what they viewed as a mishandled and secretive search process. Chairman Fennebresque resigned the next business day following Spellings's election. System-wide faculty also offered up criticism of the process, declining to prejudge the new president, but saying that she would need to work hard to overcome the distrust built by the selection process. Controversy surrounding Spellings comes on the back of controversy surrounding the unexplained firing of her predecessor, which some have accused of being politically motivated, though this has been denied by Fennebresque.\n\n\nOn October 23, 2015, Spellings was heavily criticized for making a comment about members of the LGBT community, suggesting it was a \"lifestyle.\" In addition, many UNC campuses, in early 2016, were plastered with leaflets by discontented students, decrying Spellings as a \"corporate educator\", among other criticisms, such as her closeness to right-wing political figures.\n\nOn April 7, 2016, Spellings sent instructions to all elements of the University of North Carolina system to comply with the controversial new North Carolina law, the  (HB2), which requires transgender people to use the bathroom of their birth sex. Spellings said the next day that her instructions to comply did not imply her endorsement of the law. Students around the state protested the law.\n\nOn May 4, the U.S.  informed Spellings that the University of North Carolina system was in violation of  of the  because of her previous declaration that she would enforce HB2. On May 31, the  of Raleigh reported that Spellings reversed her position and said she would not enforce HB2 to avoid a possible loss in federal funding for North Carolina.\n\n\nOn August 20, 2018, anti-racist protesters toppled the  statue at . Ms. Spellings in a joint statement said that \"The actions last evening were unacceptable, dangerous, and incomprehensible.\" \"We are a nation of laws and mob rule and the intentional destruction of public property will not be tolerated.\"\n\n\nIn October 2018, Spellings announced that she was resigning, effective March 1, 2019.\n\n\nSpelling launched the Future of Tech Commission with  founder   and former   in April 2021. As co-chairs, this commission will compile solutions for a comprehensive tech policy agenda under President Biden and Congress on topics as privacy, antitrust, digital dequity, and content moderation/platform accountability.\n\n\nSpellings appeared on '''' (episode airing November 21, 2006).

Her maternal grandfather was a general in the . Her father, Han Wu, was admitted to the  for graduate studies; however, neither he nor his wife spoke much English. Raised with  as a ,  Wu often interpreted between English and Mandarin for her parents. Her parents later were divorced.\n\nOne of four children, Wu graduated from  in 2003 as the  of her class. Wu received perfect scores on the SAT and ACT and in 2003 was selected as a  from Illinois. Wu's parents hoped that she would pursue a career in medicine so that she would have financial stability.

When her mother began to suffer from , Wu resigned, moving back to Chicago to care for her mother and two youngest siblings. To support her family financially, Wu started a  business in the  neighborhood of Chicago. In 2009, she returned to Massachusetts with her mother and youngest siblings to earn her  from , from which she graduated in 2012.\n\nIn 2010, Wu worked in  for Mayor  in the Office of Administration and Finance and later as a Fellow at the  under Menino's chief of staff, Mitch Weiss. In this position, she both designed a streamlined process for restaurants to receive licenses and established a  program. Also in 2010, Wu graduated from Emerge Massachusetts, a training program for women who aspire to elected office. The following year, she worked at the -based Medical Legal Partnership, where she provided legal services to low-income patients.\n\n while working on Warren's  Senate campaign]]\nIn her first semester at Harvard Law School, one of her professors was . After Wu explained her family's situation, a long friendship developed between the two women. Warren stated, \"Michelle was doing something in law school that, in 25 years of teaching, I never knew another student to be doing.\"\n\nIn 2012, Wu worked as the constituency director for Warren's  against . In this position, Wu coordinated outreach to all constituency groups, including communities , the  community, veterans, and women. Wu is considered a protégé of Warren.Multiple sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\nWu, a , became a member of the  in January 2014. Wu was the first  woman to serve on the council, and only the second Asian American member to serve on the council. In late 2014, Wu became the first city councilor in Boston history to give birth while serving on the Boston City Council. From January 2016 to January 2018, she served as president of the council, the first woman of color and first Asian American to hold the role. When she took office as city council president, Wu was only the third female president in the then-106 year history of the Boston City Council. Wu was regarded as a  on the City Council.\n\nWu was first elected to a Boston City Council at-large seat in . She finished in second place to incumbent , with the top four finishers being elected to the council. She was re-elected in , , and , placing second behind Pressley in 2015 and placing first in both 2017 and 2019. In 2021 election, Wu decided not to seek a fifth term on the City Council and to run for mayor instead.\n\n\nIn April 2015, the Boston City Council passed a  ordinance that was authored by Wu. The ordinance provided city employees with six weeks of paid parental leave after , , or . Mayor  supported Wu's ordinance prior to its adoption and signed it into law in May. Wu had conceived this legislation after her own first pregnancy when she learned firsthand (after giving birth in December 2014) that municipal employees were not being offered paid child leave. In 2021, Wu proposed the idea of expanding this paid child leave policy to also provide leave for the broader category of pregnancy loss, rather than strictly for stillbirths. In September, by , the Boston City Council passed an ordinance written by Councilor  and co-sponsored by Wu and Annissa Essaibi George that changed the wording of her earlier ordinance from \"stillbirth\" to \"pregnancy loss\", and also extended paid family leave to those welcoming a new family member or acting as a . The ordinance was soon after signed into law by Acting Mayor .\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2017, the Boston City Council voted to unanimously approve a resolution by Wu and fellow councilor , having the city adopt . In November 2017, the Boston City Council unanimously passed an ordinance written by Wu and fellow councilor Matt O'Malley, which implemented a . In December, Mayor Walsh signed it into law, despite his administration having previously opposed such a ban when it was previously debated by the Council in 2016.\n\nIn December 2019, the Boston City Council passed an ordinance that Wu had introduced with Matt O'Malley that protects local  and promotes adaption to climate change. Mayor Walsh signed it into law later that month. For years, Wu spearheaded efforts to have the city  its financial resources from .\n\n\n\nIn August 2020, Wu released plans for \"Boston Green New Deal & Just Recovery\" program. The proposal aims to achieve  (net-zero carbon footprint) for the municipal government buildings by 2024, running the city on 100%  by 2030, and achieving citywide carbon neutrality by 2040. The proposal calls for creating \"just and resilient development\" through the establishment of affordable green overlay districts and standard s; priority planning zones informed by  maps, in order to expand the urban tree canopy; and a \"local blue new deal\" for coasts and oceans, using coastal and ocean resources for clean energy generation, sustainable s, carbon capture, and jobs.\n\n\nWu was the leading force in efforts to regulate s of housing units. Wu pushed for increased restrictions, including the elimination of investor units, and faced targeted criticism from short-term rental platform  for this. Boston adopted an ordinance, supported by Wu, that restricted short-term rentals to  housing units, required hosts to register with the city, and required the city to collect and publish data on short-term rentals.\n\nWu, since at least 2019, supported the idea of reviving  in Boston, which would first require a change to state law. She argued that it will assist in preventing  from being pushed out of Boston. While Wu and some other Boston City Council members came out in support of the idea of rent stabilization in 2019, it was a contentious issue in the city government, with other council members and Mayor Walsh voicing opposition to it.\n\n\nIn June 2020, Wu, alongside fellow city councilors Lydia Edwards and , introduced an ordinance that would establish an unarmed community safety crisis response system, moving the response to nonviolent  calls away from the , and instead transferring the response to non-law enforcement agencies and trained health professionals. In 2020, Wu was one of eight city councilors to sign a letter urging Mayor Walsh to decrease the 's annual budget by 10%. Activists had been calling for such a cut, in order to instead allot that money to  relief, housing and food access, and other programs that would benefit communities of color. In June 2020, Wu was one of five members of the Boston City Council to vote against Mayor Walsh's 2021 operating budget for the city. While the budget made $12 million in cuts to the overtime budget of the police department, Wu argued that the city was still contractually obligated to pay for every hour of overtime work, meaning that it was inconsequential what the line item in the city budget proposed.\n\nWu voiced her desire to \"\" the city's police department. Wu led an effort to take account of the Boston Police Department's military equipment. Wu also advocated for closing loopholes in the policy of the Boston Police Department regarding s.\n\n\n\n\n\nWu proposed . Wu argued that the MBTA should explore the possibility of eliminating fares in a January 31, 2019   published in ''''. Later in 2019, she and fellow councilor Kim Janey proposed making the  bus fare-free. Janey would later fund a pilot program to make the bus route fare-free for three months while acting mayor in 2021. As mayor, Wu extended the pilot on the route 28 bus, adding two additional routes to serve other lower-income areas of the city free of charge for all riders beginning March 1, 2022, and extending for two years. The charges were picked up by the city using funds from $8 million in federal pandemic relief funds. Wu's advocacy is seen as popularizing the idea of fare-free public transportation in Boston. Crediting Wu as a leader on fare-free public transit, in January 2021, the  of ''The Boston Globe'' endorsed the idea of making the city's buses fare-free. Wu's promotion of fare-free public transit also inspired  mayor Daniel Rivera to implement it in his city.\n\n\nWu advocated for reforming the city's permitting system. Wu called for the abolition of the , which she characterized as being extremely politicized and \"opaque\". In 2019, her office published a 72-page report on the matter. Wu came into conflict with Mayor Walsh over his appointees to the city's Zoning Board of Appeals.\n\nIn March 2019, the City Council unanimously passed the Good Food Purchasing Program ordinance authored by Wu. The ordinance set new requirements for public food purchasers, such as .\n\nIn June 2014, the Boston City Council unanimously passed an ordinance Wu coauthored with fellow councilwoman Ayanna Pressley, which prohibits Boston's city government, \"from contracting with any health insurer that denies coverage or discriminates in the amount of premium, policy fees, or rates charged...because of gender identity or expression\". This ordinance guaranteed healthcare (including , , and  services) to  city employees and dependents. Wu called the ordinance, \"a matter of equity and of fairness\". The ordinance had the support of Mayor Walsh prior to its passage.\n\nWu partnered with fellow councilor Kim Janey to probe the city's process for awarding municipal contracts. Their findings were the impetus for a subsequent move by the city to start looking at ways to diversify the recipients of city contracts.\n\n\n; Suffolk County Sheriff ; and  Mayor Dan Rivera at an event for Warren's 2020 presidential campaign]]\n\nDuring the , Wu endorsed  of . Wu was among the earliest supporters of Ayanna Pressley's successful 2018 Democratic  challenge to  U.S. congressman . In the 2018 election cycle, Wu also endorsed 's unsuccessful campaign in . Wu endorsed Elizabeth Warren's  in a speech at Warren's official campaign launch in February 2019. Wu was a campaign surrogate for Warren, campaigning on her behalf in  and  ahead of those states'  and , respectively.\n\n\nAt the end of 2013, the readers of '''' magazine voted Wu to be named the magazine's 2013 \"Rookie of the Year\", one three political awards given by the magazine that year. In 2016,  of '''' named Wu as one of the United States', \"14 Young Democrats to Watch\". In 2017, the  awarded Wu its Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Award, which it considers its highest honor. In March 2018, Wu was among six finalists to be honored as a \"Rising Star\" by , a national group that supports female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights. The next month, Wu was listed as one of the \"100 Most Influential People in Boston\" by ''Boston'' magazine, being listed 31st on the list. In 2019, Rachel Allen of '''' wrote that Wu had emerged as one of Boston's \"most effective politicians\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWu had long been viewed a future mayoral prospect, fielding questions about whether she'd consider one day running as far back as 2016. Since at least 2019, Wu was viewed as a potential challenger to incumbent mayor Marty Walsh, if Walsh sought reelection in 2021. She announced her candidacy on September 15, 2020. She was regarded to be challenging Walsh from the .\n\nWalsh was designated by   to be his nominee for  on January 7, 2021, leaving the mayor's race an . Senator Elizabeth Warren endorsed Wu for mayor two days later. By September 2021, Wu was widely considered to be the front-runner in the , with a significant polling lead. Wu ultimately placed first in the nonpartisan primary and advanced to the general election, where she faced fellow city council member . Other candidates in the primary election had been acting mayor Kim Janey, city councilor , and former city economic chief .\n\nOn September 25, Acting Mayor Kim Janey, who placed fourth in the nonpartisan primary, endorsed Wu for the general election. Wu was viewed as the front-runner in the general election campaign, with advantages in endorsements, including from cultural groups, Congresswoman , both of Massachusetts' U.S. Senators ( and Elizabeth Warren), and the editorial board of ''The Boston Globe''.  of '''' characterized Wu as having benefited as a candidate from her years of engagement with the city's residents as a city councilor. She opined that Wu's work while on the City Council had introduced her to many of the city's voters and that Wu was, \"difficult to caricature as a radical.\" In both the primary and general elections, Wu ran on a progressive-oriented agenda.\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Wu won the election with over 64% of the vote, becoming the first woman and first person of color to become mayor of Boston. Wu won sizable margins among various demographic groups, leading her victory to be characterized as one with a multiethnic coalition. Wu was sworn in on November 16, 2021. At 36 years of age, Wu was the youngest person elected mayor of Boston in almost a century.\n\n\n\n\n\nWu had a shorter transition into office than most mayors of Boston due to the fact that there was no permanent incumbent mayor at the time of the election. Under Boston's city charter, in such circumstances, new mayors are sworn in as soon as is conveniently possible after the results of the election are certified. Before the election, on September 24, candidates Wu and Essaibi George had met with Acting Mayor Janey at the  and mutually agreed on November 16 date as a tentative date for a transition of power for the mayoralty. Wu would ultimately take office as mayor on that planned date. This meant that she had only a two-week period between her election and assumption of office.\n\n\n (center) and City Council President  (right)]]\n\nIn March 2023, Emma Platoff of the ''Boston Globe'' credited Wu's ability to frequently prevail on matters that she and the City Council had not been aligned on to Wu's own \"political savvy\", the strong legal power afforded to mayors of Boston, divisions on the City Council that gave the body a weaker negotiating position, and the inexperience of new council members.\n\n\n\nWu serves on the steering committee on .\nShe has supported  authored by Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman  to recognize a duty of the federal government to create a Green New Deal.\n\nWithin the City, Wu signed an ordinance on November 22, 2021, to divest city investments from companies that derive more than 15 percent of their , , or . This is seen as being part of her pursuit of a municipal Green New Deal for Boston. The process entails the divestment of $65 million in city assets. The new rules do not apply to Boston's employee pension fund, which is governed by state law. While a member of the city council, she had fought for the adoption of such a policy. On May 16, 2022, Wu pledged that the city would carry out a \"Green New Deal\" for Boston Public Schools (BPS) school buildings, which will see renovation of existing facilities and the construction new ones. This plan expands the funding the city is to invest in school construction from the $1 billion outlined in Marty Walsh's 2015 BuildBPS plan to $2 billion. She then unveiled a proposed  petition in August 2022 that would see the city request entrance to the state's pilot program for municipalities to ban fossil fuels from most new buildings, with the exception of labs and hospitals. The following month, the Boston City Council approved the home rule petition 9–3. The next step is for the state legislature to rule on whether to grant the petition. As part of a $20 million housing program funded through COVID recovery funds, Wu's mayoral administration is planning to launch the \"Large Building Green Energy Retrofits Program\" providing building owners of buildings with fifteen or more units up to $10,000 to support efforts to reduce their buildings' energy use through \"deep energy retrofits\". The program is targeted at retrofitting the city's existing housing stock. In July 2023, Wu signed an executive order halting the use of fossil fuels in new municipal buildings and major renovations.\n\nWu has called attention to the health risks that many residents, and disproportionately people of color, face due to  from s, especially in . In April 2022, on , as part of the city's Climate Ready Boston efforts, Wu unveiled the Heat Resilience for Boston plan. This plan centers on combatting the impacts of rising heat extremes, focusing on the \" communities\" of , , , , and . Wu also announced the creation of the Boston Extreme Temperatures Response Task Force to coordinate efforts across the city related to handling heat extremes.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, Wu announced a city . Under the mandate, people ages 12 and older, in order to enter indoor public venues (bars, restaurants, gyms, theaters, and sports venues) in Boston, would be required to show proof of at least their first  dose by January 15, 2022, and of full vaccination by February 15, 2022. The mandate promoted opposition, and in an interview with Boston Public Radio, Wu stated that she received racist messages in response to vaccine requirements. Some opponents circulated false rumors about Wu being hospitalized for panic attacks while in office. On February 19, 2022, Wu announced that the city would end its proof-of-vaccine mandate for public places with immediate effect.\n\nThe Wu administration also required city employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (with exceptions for employees with medical reasons and religious objectors), and about 94% of city employees were in compliance with that requirement by late January 2022.Staff Reports,  , NBC News (January 24, 2022). Wu extended the deadline for city employees to comply. Some public employee unions fought the mandate in court, arguing that the mandate rules should be subject to . A  judge sided with the unions, blocking the city worker mandate. Wu faced persistent demonstrations outside of her house protesting her COVID measures.\n\n\n at the December 2021 groundbreaking of an affordable housing development]]\n\nWu has given far fewer appointments for one-on-one meetings with private developers than her predecessors did, giving them fewer opportunities to directly lobby her on policies. In December 2021, Wu signed into law an ordinance amending the city's zoning code by eliminating off-street parking minimums for new affordable developments where 60% of the units are income-restricted at 100% the area median income in order to remove a barrier for the construction of new units of affordable housing. In October 2022, Wu signed an executive order that changed the approval process in the city for new income-restricted affordable housing developments. The order sought to halve the time that the approval process takes. Impacting nine city agencies (including the BPDA), the order established a separate review and approval process for affordable housing developments and requested the BPDA give priority to such developments.\n\nIn her early months as mayor, Wu moved hundreds of unhoused individuals that had been living in the  area to . In January 2022, Wu designated $50 million to fund improvements to the Mildred C. Hailey Apartments complex in the  neighborhood. In January 2022, Wu also signed an executive order to adopt a municipal  policy. This made Boston the largest city in the United States to adopt such a policy. Wu's 2020 Municipal Green New Deal proposal calls for \"decommodifying housing\" through the expansion of , s, and community ownerships. It also calls for the establishment of a renters' right to counsel, guaranteeing legal representation to tenants in  proceedings.\n\nSince as early as 2019, Wu has supported reviving  in Boston, which would first require a change to state law. In March 2022, Wu announced the creation of a Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee, which will report to the city's Office of Housing on Strategies with advice on means to stabilize rents in the city and to combat the displacement of tenants, with the aim of creating a proposal to present to the City Council. On March 8, 2023, in a 11–2 vote the Boston City Council consented to two home rule petitions proposed by Wu: one asking the state government to permit the city to implement a form of rent control, and the other asking the state to permit Boston to implement Wu's plan to restructure the Boston Planning & Development Agency. The two petitions will need to be approved by the state government in order for Boston to be granted these permissions.\n\n\n\nBoston's public transportation operator, the MBTA, is a division of the  (MassDOT), limiting the power that the mayor of Boston has over transportation in the city. Nevertheless, Wu has taken actions and voiced positions related to the city's transportation.\n\n, Wu, City Council President Ed Flynn, and Governor Charlie Baker in June 2022]]\n\nIn December 2021 Wu extended the fare-free pilot program for the MBTA Route 28 bus that was started under the acting mayoralty of Kim Janey by two months. She did this with while engaging in talks with the MBTA to further extend the pilot program. The City had, in November 2021, announced that its data showed that during the pilot program ridership had increased to an excess of 70,000 in weekly ridership. Pre COVID-pandemic weekly ridership on the route had been 47,000, making the COVID-era pilot program ridership significantly greater despite the general impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transportation rider. The city concluded that, in comparison to ridership trends on comparable routes of the MBTA, the increase in ridership was directly attributable to the pilot program. A later more in-depth 2022 analysis found an overall 38% increase in weekday ridership from 7,500 before the pandemic (with fares) to 10,200 during the September and October periods during the pilot program.\n\nIn mid-November 2021, Wu sent an appropriations order to the Boston City Council to ask for approval to appropriate $8 million of federal funds to fund two years of fare-free service on the MBTA Route 23, 28, and 29 buses. These buses serve the Dorchester, Mattapan, and Roxbury communities. At the start of December, the City Council approved the appropriations order 12–1. On February 9, 2022, Wu and MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak announced that the two-year program for the three routes to be fare-free was officially agreed to and would be launched on March 1, 2022.\n\n\nIn July 2022, following a seven-month search, Wu named  as the new commissioner of the .\n\nIn June 2023, Wu vetoed a $5 million cut in Boston Police and Veterans Services departments proposed by the City Council calling their attempt \"illusory, as the city is obligated to cover salary and overtime expenses incurred by the department,\" and that the city's budget should be \"built on a foundation of effective delivery of city services that are central to our residents' quality of life.\"\n\nIn December 2023, Wu reached a contract agreement with the . In the terms of the contract, the union agreed that officers would lose the option to use  to appeal firings or other disciplinary measures if they are convicted of certain crimes. The contract also saw the union agree to allow pay details of the department to be made public, and for there to be more strict outlines on when officers are permitted to take .  Yawu Miller of the '''' described it as being, \"the first [contract] in which [Boston] city officials have managed to secure significant reforms from the Patrolmen’s union.\" It was approved unanimously by the Boston City Council on December 13, 2024. In March 2024, a similar contract was reached with the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society.\n\n\nWu has expressed a belief that her  should reflect the city's population, arguing that that is consequential towards making the city's government more responsive to its different communities. People of color hold a majority in her cabinet. As of August 2022, Wu's cabinet had thirteen  members, thirteen  members, six  members, and two Asian American members. In December 2023, Wu organized an \"Electeds of Color\" holiday party, excluding White members of the City Council from attendance. While anti-racism advocates and Council members called the event \"divisive\" and \"inflammatory,\" Wu refused to apologize.\n\nIn January 2022, Wu signed an executive order to adopt a municipal Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing policy. This made Boston the largest city in the United States to adopt such a policy.\n\nIn May 2022, Boston awarded a $17 million contract to City Fresh Foods, a local Black-owned business, to be a vendor for Boston City Schools.  This was the largest non-construction contract that the city had awarded to a certified Black-owned business in its history. This has been credited as being indicative of Wu's impact on how the city government views matters of diversity. The contract has also been credited as helping to achieve the goals of the Good Food Purchasing Program that was created by an ordinance that had been authored by Wu as a city councilwoman.\n\n\n (center) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (left)]]\n\nIn May 2022, Wu unveiled plans for a \"Green New Deal\" for Boston Public School buildings, which doubles the capital spending that the city will devote to the construction of new and renovated school buildings to $2 billion compared to the $1 million that had been outlined in former mayor Marty Walsh's 2015 BuildBPS plan. Wu has pledged for the city to have a more equitable and transparent process for school construction and capital improvements than in the past and that the process will involve input from students, educators, and parents. In September 2022, Wu announced the creation of the Cabinet for Worker Empowerment. One of the tasks of this new department is providing oversight to this \"Green New Deal\" for the city's schools. Another of the department's tasks is to establish a trust fund for childcare.\n\nIn July 2022, Wu signed an executive order outlining the formula for what funds developers building in the city's downtown must contribute to fund child care services. This executive order builds upon a policy implemented in 1989 under the mayoralty of , which requires that new commercial developments in the city's downtown provide childcare services on-site or otherwise fund resources for off-site childcare spaces. However, the policy had, previous to Wu's executive order, been difficult to enforce due to the fact that the policy did not previous provide a clear definition of the amounts that developers needed to pay.\n\nWu opposed proposals by the state to place Boston Public Schools into state , which arose from negative assessments of the city's schools in studies that were taken in 2020, before her mayoralty. In June 2022, Wu and Massachusetts state education officials settled on an agreement to improve Boston Public Schools, averting receivership. In February 2023, Wu ed a city council ordinance to advance a home rule petition that requested that the state make the city's public school board an elected body. Wu wrote that she, \"deeply respect[s]\" the advocates' of the ordinance, but, \"cannot support legislative changes that would compromise our ability to stabilize and support the Boston Public Schools during this critical period.\" Previously, when she had run for mayor in 2021 Wu's education plan had called for a restructuring of the Boston School Committee that would have seen the committee have a majority of its seats be elected. Wu backed away from this support of a transition to a partially elected board after becoming mayor, arguing that it was an inopportune time for such a change to take place.\n\n\n in November 2022]]\n\nIt has been observed that Wu's approach to dealing with the city's business elite has differed from her predecessors. In May 2023, Brian McGrory of ''The Boston Globe'' observed that Wu has given greater precedence toward attending to other municipal concerns than she does to giving an audience to the city's business elites. Describing Wu as \"a different kind of mayor, with a different view of her city\" from her predecessors, McGrory wrote, \"when Wu sets her priorities...[and] when she imagines her legacy, she’s not gazing at the city’s skyline or at the people who are building it. Rather, she's obsessed with the seemingly intractable problems that fester in the shadows of those gleaming towers.\" Also in May 2023,  (also of ''The Boston Globe'') similarly observed that, \"previous mayors have welcomed tête-à-têtes with real estate developers and other captains of industry to discuss projects or other matters. Often, those were one-on-one meetings. [...] Instead, she prefers to assemble groups of leaders to help shape specific policies and forge public-private partnerships...the noticeable change in approach continues to ruffle the feathers of those who are used to having the ear of the mayor, all of which is perpetuating a narrative that Wu is indifferent to business interests.\" It has been also been observed by ''The Boston Globe'' that Wu grants substantially fewer meetings to real estate developers than her processors had, giving them less opportunities to directly lobby her.\n\nAs a city councilor, Wu had called for reforming the procurement process for city contracts in order to ensure that businesses owned by people of color, women, and city residents are given a \"fair shot\" at winning contracts. She also called for the city to provide assistance for entrepreneurs of color as well as support for small neighborhood businesses. She also called for greater government transparency regarding corporate tax breaks, and introduced an ordinance in 2019 that was aimed at accomplishing that. In December 2017, after the Boston City Council passed the \"Ordinance on Equity in Opportunity for City Contracting\", Wu and fellow city councilor Ayanna Pressley authored an op-ed published in the ''Dorchester Reporter'' which hailed the ordinance and argued that the city needed to \"continue to create pipelines for local residents and businesses owned by women and people of color.\"\n\nIn August 2022, Boston received a $23 million American Rescue Plan  from the  to establish a Regional Workforce Training System aimed at training and placing individuals for 4,618 quality jobs in targeted industries over three years starting in October 2022. The Mayor's Office of Workforce Development had been the lead applicant, working with other there parties and organizations in their grant application. On  2022, Wu announced the creation of the Cabinet for Worker Empowerment. One of the tasks this new department was assigned is overseeing the creation of more job training centers in the city.\n\n\nIn 2022, Wu was honored by  (which honors those of Asian Pacific descent). The organization honored her and fellow mayors  and  as having made the \"most impact\" in the field of advocacy and policy. The  Class of 2022 selected Wu to be their Class Day speaker. Wu had been the first alumnus of Harvard College to be elected mayor of Boston since  was elected in . In 2022,  recognized Wu in its Time100 Next list of emerging leaders. The article accompanying her entry was authored by Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. In 2022, Wu received the \"Catalyst for Justice Award\" from Massachusetts Public Health Association. The  gave Wu the \"Voice of Change\" award at its 2023 Beacon Awards for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. \n\nIn 2022, ''Boston'' magazine ranked Wu at the top of its list of \"100 Most Influential Bostonians\". In 2023, she was ranked ninth on the same list. In 2024, the magazine ranked Wu as second on the list behind only Governor , describing the two as  being the city's \"power duo\".\n\nWu has also received recognition honoring her for supporting the arts. In 2023 Mayor Wu received the  annual \" Champion Award\" for her dedication to the arts and education in Massachusetts. That same year, Wu and former acting mayor Janey received the  Foundation's \"Champion Award\".\n\n\nBoth during her tenure as mayor and as a member of the Boston City Council, Wu has been described as being a progressive. Wu has also been described as a . Early into her council career, Wu identified herself as a \" progressive\". In a September 2022 article,  of ''The New York Times'' described Wu as a \"progressive but not aggressively ideological\" mayor. In a November 2021 article, Ellen Barry of ''The New York Times'' opined that while Wu is a strong progressive, she is also \"difficult to caricature as a radical.\" E. Tammy Kim of '''' has described the political philosophy that Wu promotes as, \"progressive pragmatism\" Wu has been widely described as a protégée of Elizabeth Warren. WGBH columnist Adam Reilly has described Wu as a mentee of past Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. Wu had worked in Menino's mayoral administration.\n\n\nIn February 2014, the Boston City Council unanimously passed a resolution authored by Wu which voiced the City Council's support for the Massachusetts Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights that was pending before the .\n\nAs City Councilor, Wu voiced support for a \"fair work week\", , paid family and medical leave, protections for s.\n\nIn October 2018, Wu proposed a \"fair work week\" ordinance, which would have required all city contractors to give employees at least two weeks of notice prior to changing their schedules, and would require employers to compensate workers for late schedule changes.\n\nWu’s 2020 proposal for a \"food justice\" agenda for Boston called for an increase to the minimum wage paid to food-sector workers and for providing guaranteed paid sick leave to them. It also took a stance in favor of gradually phasing out  for restaurant and bar workers.\n\nAs a city councilor, Wu authored an adopted ordinance which provided paid parental leave to municipal employees. Before the passage of the ordinance by the City Council, Wu and Mayor Mary Walsh co-authored an  in ''The Boston Globe'' that called paid parental leave, \"a must for working families\".\n\n\nWu advocated for late night public transit in her original platform when running for City Council in 2012. In this vein, in 2015, she voiced her support for having the MBTA extend its pilot \"late-night T\" program, which kept transit service open late on the weekends.\n\nWu is a supporter of fare-free public transit. Wu argued in a January 31, 2019 op-ed published in ''The Boston Globe'' that the MBTA should explore the elimination of transit fares, writing \n\n (second from right), Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (far right), and others at a press conference for the Freedom to Move Act that would provide federal funding for fare-free public transport]]\n\nShe further argued that Boston should set an example for the rest of the county in free access to transit, likening it to past municipal innovations the city introduced. Wu's 2020 proposal for a municipal Green New Deal incorporated her proposal for fare-free public transit.\n\nWu has supported federal legislation on the matter of fare-free public transit, including helping Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley in 2020 to promote their proposed \"Freedom to Move Act\".  The act would provide  to communities that eliminate transit fares.\n\nWu's advocacy is regarded to have popularized the idea of fare-free public transportation in Boston. Crediting Wu as a leader on fare-free public transit, in January 2021, ''The Boston Globe'''s  board endorsed the idea of making the city's buses fare-free. Wu's promotion of fare-free public transit also inspired  mayor Daniel Rivera to implement it in his city.\n\nBoth Kim Janey, as acting mayor, and Wu, as mayor, took steps that introduced fare-free transit on several bus routes in the city.\n\n\nIn 2016, Wu supported  to legalize the recreational use of cannabis in Massachusetts. This put her at odds with Mayor Marty Walsh, who was a prominent opponent of legalization.\n\nWu supports protecting access to . In 2019, Wu partnered with attorney general Maura Healey, congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, and fellow city councilor Lydia Edwards in a digital campaign urging the state government to adopt the Roe Act. This was a proposed state statue intended to codify the protections of abortion care provided in the '''' U.S. Supreme Court decision (a decision which was still  at the time).\n\nAs a city councilor, Wu voiced support for .\n\n\n\n\nWhen Wu was in her early twenties, having recently graduated from Harvard University, and living in Boston and working for Boston Consulting Group, her mother developed severe mental illness and was diagnosed with . Wu returned to the family home in the Chicago suburbs to care for the mother and raise her two youngest siblings.\n\nWu secured medical care for her mother, and she also opened a teahouse, hoping her mother might recover enough to run it. Eventually, she entered  and relocated with her mother and youngest sibling to Boston. She became the  of her youngest sibling, and became actively involved in the sibling's education at the Eliot School of Boston (a private K–8 school). Wu has said that she regards the experience of assuming the care of her mother and younger siblings to have been the most important turning point of her life.\n\n\nWhile attending Harvard College, Wu began a  with Conor Pewarski, having been introduced by mutual friends at a  party that she hosted. Pewarski had been a Yale student. When Wu moved back to Chicago in order to help her mother and sisters following the onset of her mother's mental illness, Pewarski abandoned a fledging career in Hollywood film production and moved with her. When Wu attended Harvard Law School, he continued to live with her. Pewarski  to Wu on December 7, 2011 on ; they married on September 8, 2012. The couple now live in Boston's  neighborhood with their two sons and her mother. Pewarski worked as a community lender at  until resigning his position shortly after Wu took office as mayor, opting to become a  after Wu became mayor.\n\n\n\nIn December 2014, Wu gave birth to her oldest child, a boy, thereby becoming the first member in the history of the Boston City Council to give birth while in office. Her experience of learning that employees of Boston's government lacked the option of  inspired her successful ordinance to create such a policy. Wu's second son was born in 2017. Wu opted to forgo maternity leave. When she returned to work after each pregnancy, Wu brought her newborn sons with her to City Council meetings. As of 2024, Wu enrolls both of her sons in .\n\nIn late-July 2024, Wu announced that she is pregnant with a daughter and is  in January 2025. She disclosed that she does not plan on taking a maternity leave. At this time, she also publicly disclosed that in the years since the birth of her second son, she had had two other pregnancies that had each ended in . When speaking to delegates from New Hampshire during an event at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Wu divulged further details on her experiences with pregnancy. Wu drew connections between her experiences and matters in contention amid a post-'''' legal landscape, including access to fertilization methods such as  and access to medications such as  (which can be used for , and had been banned in many states post-''Dobbs''). Wu divulged that her current pregnancy has been conceived with the aid of “assisted reproductive technology”. She also shared that one of her two miscarriages had been a so-called “missed miscarriage” that had occurred at an early stage of pregnancy. The remains of the fetus she was carrying was discovered during an ultrasound Wu had undergone to confirm whether she was pregnant. She further shared that following the discovery that she had had this miscarriage, she took Mifepristone and  to aid her body in removing the fetal remains.\n\n\n\nWu plays the piano, having started taking lessons when she was 4; and on her first day as mayor, had one put in her office at city hall.

At the age of 2, his family moved to Germany where his father, a member of the United States Army, was stationed. In 1984, Frye moved to Georgia after his father accepted a job to be the head pastor at a Presbyterian church in Griffin, GA.\n\nToday, Frye lives in Athens, GA where he has resided since 1989. His wife, Gretchen, is an emergency room nurse at Athens Regional Hospital. The couple has been married since 2000 and has two children, Spencer and Ruby, both of whom attend public school in the district that Frye represents.

He first lived in the island country at the age of 13 and had the opportunity to learn construction skills while building a Baptist church in Pechaud. As a young adult, Frye taught English as a second language at L'Ecole Saint Espris Vocational School. After a year, he returned to the University of Georgia but left again due to financial hardship.\n\nThough Frye had every intention of returning to school quickly, he did not re-enroll until almost twenty-five years later. In the fall 2013, he signed up to take the first of his two remaining classes, wanting to set a good example for his children about the importance of attaining an education and finishing what you start. Frye has also said he hopes his experience will encourage others to return to school or attain job skills that will help them build a future.\n\nAfter taking classes for two fall semesters, Frye graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology on December 19, 2014. This experience was eye opening to Frye, who said he saw the many barriers students face when trying to finish a degree, such as the expenses of required electronics.\n\n\nSince 2006, Frye has worked as the Executive Director for Athens Area Habitat for Humanity. He first started at Habitat in 1999 as a construction manager, planning to only work with the non-profit for a year. After seeing the fulfilling work that Habitat does first hand, Frye knew that he wanted to continue helping families purchase their own homes and decided to stay.\n\nToday, as executive director, he carries out board and Habitat International policy, handles day-to-day operations, oversees all acquisitions, developments and constructions as the licensed contractor, and oversees operations at both Habitat for Humanity Restores in Athens.

In the July Democratic Primary, Frye faced 20 year Incumbent, Keith Heard, who he defeated with 55.33% of the vote, which he attributed to his strong involvement in the community. He then went on to win in a landslide with 70.42% of the vote in the General Election against Republican Carter Kessler.\n\nToday, Frye serves on the Budget and Fiscal Oversight Committee as the first Democrat to be appointed to committee leadership since 2004. He also serves as a member on the Game, Fish, and Parks; Ways and Means; Transportation; Health and Human Services; Human Relations and Aging Committees. In 2018, Frye was appointed to the Working Group on Creative Arts and  Entertainment and the Special Committee on Access to Quality Health Care. Previously, he also served on the Science and Technology Committee.\n\nIn 2016, Frye was appointed to the Joint Georgia House and Senate Music Economic Development Study Committee, which worked to encourage and promote the continued growth and success of the music industry in the state. Frye has said he was excited to be appointed because he was interested in tax incentives to benefit smaller music studios, and even the individual musicians, working in Georgia, as well as the larger music enterprises. In 2015, Frye was the only Democrat to serve on the House Study Committee on Short-Term Rental Providers, which worked to determine the best methods to ensure the safety of the public, prevent illegal practices, collect taxes on business activities, and otherwise properly regulate short-term rental providers.\n\nThroughout his time in the Georgia General Assembly, Frye has devoted his time to supporting legislation that strengthens all Georgia families, protects waterways, ensures the safety of our children, improves transportation, and promotes more access to housing and healthcare.\n\n\nIn 2011, when Frye first began campaigning for State Representative he recruited a group of university students from the Athens area to be a part of the 2012 campaign staff. He was inspired by their excitement, hard work, and desire to work on legislation, so after being elected he founded the Spencer Frye Fellowship Program.

No one else in the General Assembly had this pool of young pupils of various undergrad and graduate programs that were able to provide a commitment to constituents and detailed analyses of policy.\n\nToday, the Fellowship has grown to be a selective year-long program that accepts 25 fellows each fall who are given the opportunity to grow as young professionals, leaders, and active community members. The Fellowship is divided into Public Relations Fellows and Legislative Fellows.\n\nThe program’s mission is to cultivate a coalition of aware and active leaders that will use their knowledge to impact our future; not only on a state level, but also on a global scale by bringing local relevance to the national and global community.\n\n\nFrye is a member of the Homebuilder's Association Board, UGA Masters of Public Administration Advisory Board, UGA School of Social Work Board of Visitors, Athens Rotary Club, Compassionate Care Hospice Advisory Board, and the Athens Clarke County Democratic Committee.\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There George and Dorothea Breitman helped to organize the \"Friday Night Socialist Forum\" (later called the \"Militant Labor Forum\"), a weekly lecture series that attracted participants a broad range of activists from labor, radical, and black liberation groups. To pay the bills, Breitman worked as a printer and proofreader for the ''.'' As such, he was a member of the .\n\nBreitman returned from Detroit to New York in the late 1960s to take over management of  the SWP's publishing arm, . In that capacity, he served as editor of a 14-volume collection entitled '''', which was published from 1969 to 1979. During his time at the helm of Pathfinder, Breitman was instrumental in the publication of various collections of writings by SWP leading light  and a pioneering selection of writings by , entitled ''Malcolm X Speaks'' (1965).\n\nAlthough politically a child of the 1930s, Brietman was deeply influenced by the radical movements of the 1960s and 70s seeing them as a harbinger of a coming social revolution which he prophesied would have a \"combined character\" being both a socialist revolution of the working class against capitalism merged with the struggles and demands of \"specially oppressed\" people: Blacks, Latinos and other nationally oppressed people; women, gays and others, groups Brietman pointed that were, like the American population in general, overwhelmingly working class.  Brietman described the radical movements of that period as constituting a \"New Radicalization\"\nthat was deeper and broader than the ones he described as occurring before the Civil War among abolitionists and small farmers and later among industrial workers and socialists during the turn of the century in the era of the Bolshevik Revolution up through the 1930s.  He thus saw that it portended the prospect of a great social upheaval.  In a certain sense he adopted and translated into Old Left and orthodox Marxist terms, New Leftist ideas.  For this he was denounced as a  like revisionist by sectarian Marxists,  while others viewed his ideas as entirely correct, even visionary, which explored the issues Marcuse addressed on a deeper level, reconciling them with revolutionary Marxism, whose adherents, in the words of Lenin, must at all times be \"tribunes of the people\" responding to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression.\n\nIn the late 1970s Breitman opposed what he saw as a growing fixation of the SWP's top leadership on the  leadership of the , and  became involved in a factional opposition group in the SWP beginning in 1981. This disagreement over the direction ultimately led to Breitman's expulsion from the SWP in 1984.\n\nDespite ill health, Breitman played a leading role in the foundation of the , which sought to unify U.S. supporters of the Fourth International. Continuing his editorial activities, he was a contributing editor of the group's journal, ''.''Lubitz and Lubitz, \"George Breitman,\" p. 3.\n\nBreitman used several pseudonyms over the course of his life, including most famously \"Albert Parker,\" but also \"\"Philip Blake,\" \"Drake,\" \"Chester Hofla,\" \"Anthony Massini,\" \"John F. Petrone,\" and \"G. Sloane.\"\n\n\nBreitman died of a heart attack on April 19, 1986, in New York City.\n\nBreitman's papers are held by the  at .

When asked about cuts to PeachCare, Richardson said that \"Peachcare and health care is not a constitutional right.\" In addition, Richardson has proposed increasing the sales tax in Georgia from 4% to 5.75%.

At the time of his death, Langford was hospitalized on compassionate release from serving a 15-year federal prison sentence.\n\n\n\nLangford was born in Birmingham on March 18, 1946. He graduated from  before entering the . He graduated from the  in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree in social and .\n\n\nLangford was a  for WBRC-6, which at the time was the  affiliate in Birmingham, during the mid 1970s. He was the community's first African-American TV news reporter. He was later a  director for a Birmingham  distributor. Prior to entering politics, Langford was a well known local television personality.\n\n\nLangford, a , was elected to the county commission in 2002. His colleagues on the five-member commission elected Langford as commission president, the first African-American to hold the office.\n\nHe also served as mayor of , and served one term on the Birmingham City Council.\n\nLangford raised money and generated public interest and support for Visionland Theme Park (now known as ), located near . The park was built largely by  issues backed by a  of municipalities in the western part of the county, as well as the city of Birmingham and the county government. The park later declared bankruptcy, and was sold to  for just over $5&nbsp;million at auction.\n\nAs Fairfield mayor, Langford spoke publicly many times about his plans to run for higher office, particularly . After the bankruptcy of Visionland, Langford's political fortunes seemed to wane, and his talk of higher office diminished. After losing the county commission presidency, Langford announced on June 5, 2007, that he would run for mayor of Alabama's largest city.\n\nLangford stunned many when he emerged as a top contender in a field of 10 candidates that included incumbent mayor . Preliminary results credited him with 26,277 of 52,111 votes cast in the election, meaning that he avoided a runoff with challenger Patrick Cooper by 170 votes. Cooper then challenged the election in court, saying that Langford was still a resident of Fairfield and did not legally reside within Birmingham's city limits. Cooper later withdrew his case after a judge declared Langford's downtown loft a legal residence.\n\nWhile in office Langford was a member of the ,  an anti-gun group with a stated goal of \"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets and that at the time was co-chaired by Boston Mayor  and New York City Mayor .\n\nLangford was long a proponent of a d stadium for the city, intended to replace the aging  as a venue for  on the collegiate and professional levels. He previously promoted a tax hike to pay for the dome, which was soundly rejected by voters a decade earlier under then-Mayor , although later analysis of votes showed an overwhelming support for the dome inside city limits. After taking office as Birmingham mayor, Langford vowed that a domed stadium would be built in the city no matter what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n sack, speaks to a crowd at Boutwell Auditorium on April 22, 2008]]\nLangford, who converted to Catholicism in 1996, was both praised and criticized for the degree to which his Christian faith informed his political agenda. He held Bible studies for municipal workers at City Hall each week and was a frequent speaker at public prayer services and church events.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, Langford issued a proclamation on city letterhead proclaiming the following Friday to be \"It's Time to Pray\" in the City of Birmingham. He called upon \"all Bishops, Priests, Pastors, s and all of our citizens of various denominations and creeds\" to join him in donning  sacks and having their heads smeared with ashes during a prayer rally at .  Inspired by a custom described in the Bible of putting on “sackcloth with ashes” as a sign of mourning, the display was intended to show humility and restore God's favor to a city Langford described as wracked with violence. Anticipating complaints from defenders of the , Langford stated that \"the Constitution of the United States calls for a separation of church and state – it never said anything about a separation of church from state.\"\n\n\nLangford injured relations with the Birmingham  community in May 2008 when he refused to sign a proclamation for the annual Central Alabama , an event that had been held on the city's south side every year since 1989. He refused to allow banners on city property for the event. Langford further stated that it was inappropriate for the government to condone a lifestyle. He was quoted as saying: \"My policy is don't ask because it's not my business, and don't put me in the position to make it my business.\"\n\n\"I thought I had stated my position very clearly. If I were to sign the permit to put up banners on city right of ways I would be condoning that which I don't condone,\" he said. \"To give a proclamation is totally under the purview of the mayor.\"\n\n, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, and Birmingham civil rights attorney David Gespass filed suit on behalf of the Central Alabama Pride group against Larry Langford seeking an order from the courts to prohibit the mayor from discriminating against LGBTQ organizations in administering city services. The organization hoped to use a ruling in their favor to discourage further discriminatory practices in Birmingham and other cities where the legal precedent would apply. A settlement agreement was reached on September 1, 2009. The settlement, reached after a federal judge ruled against the city and mayor in their efforts to have the case dismissed, comes after Lambda Legal and local attorney David Gespass filed the lawsuit in August 2008 in the Northern District of Alabama on behalf of CAP based on Mayor Langford's actions in refusing to allow city workers to attach Pride banners on city light posts. Members of CAP were allowed, however, to hang the banners on their own after paying the expense of bucket trucks. CAP members alleged that they had been allowed in previous years to hang Gay Pride banners displayed in accordance with the city's practice of attaching banners for a variety of organizations that have held events in the city.

Blount's firm earned $7.1&nbsp;million in fees from the bond deals while LaPierre was paid $219,500 by Blount for his help the scheme. Jefferson County banks made approximately $120&nbsp;million by encouraging the county to refinance nearly all of its bonds using swaps.

The U.S. government sought $7.6&nbsp;million in forfeiture from the three men.\n\nAfter being convicted in a trial in federal court in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Langford was serving out a 15-year federal felony sentence until he was released resentenced to time served in light of life-threatening health issues.\n\nHe was inmate #27349-001 at , a Federal prison hospital near Lexington, Kentucky.

More specifically, the initiative includes the creation of the Neighborhood Safety Bike Team, increased patrol officers in downtown Long Beach, specialized drugs officers directed toward areas with high crime rates, and the establishment of enhanced Quality of life officers.\n\n\nThe West Side Promise was introduced by Richardson in his 2024 budget reveal, in which he proposed a 10-year investment plan to identify ways to improve West Long Beach's housing supply and economy, while maintaining climate resiliency. West Long Beach has experienced some significant hardships in recent years, including a lack of basic necessities like banks, full-service grocery stores, and pharmacies. West Long Beach is also very close to Interstate 710 and the Port of Long Beach, which causes its residents to experience many health issues. In order to remedy these issues, Richardson's West Side Promise's plans to drive economic and equitable investments, increase open spaces, and work to decrease pollution in West Long Beach.\n\n\nRichardson has made many efforts to reshape Long Beach, California’s economy through his budget proposals leading up to 2024. To support this approach, Richardson has drafted his proposal for Long Beach revolving around Elevate 28, a billion-dollar plan to improve the Long Beach area. The $3.2 billion proposal focuses on helping the homeless and preparing the community for the 2028 Olympic Games. The final budget for this fiscal year was established and planned to begin on October 1. After many revisions, this budget was focused on allocating funds toward the upcoming Olympics, infrastructure, and more. More key motivations of this program were to upgrade the population’s quality of life - aiming to extend life expectancy and decrease homeless rates around the city by finding safe and supportive residences for the homeless. This budget also incorporates strategies to inject money into smaller locally owned businesses to improve the local community around Long Beach, the hope is to support small businesses and spur more tourism.\n\nDuring the $3.2 billion budget proposal, Rex Richardson has advocated for a plan that is meant to supply more resources to the city. This 10-year plan is called the West Side Promise. This promise is meant to fight against the environmental racism that has plagued the city for years, and Richardson believes this will be a beneficial investment for the city. Some key attributes of this program include developing a new cultural center and new parks in the area. The hope for this program is to improve Long Beach's quality of life by providing them with basic necessities and resources. To make this program successful, the city would need funding from private and public industries to provide these resources for the city.\n\n\nRichardson and his wife, Nina, have two daughters.

A member of the , he first entered Congress in 2011, representing  until redistricting. Keating's district includes  and most of the . He raised his profile advocating for criminal justice issues in both houses of the  from 1977 to 1999 before becoming  of , where he served three terms before being elected to Congress.\n\nRaised in , Keating \"took a traditional route to politics\", attending  and . He was elected to the  in 1976 at age 24 and went on to serve in the  from 1985 to 1999. He authored numerous bills signed into law concerning taxation, drug crime, and sentencing reform. His attempted overthrow of Senate President  in 1994 was a failure but boosted his local name recognition, which contributed to his success in the 1998 election for DA.\n\nKeating followed the path of former Norfolk County District Attorney  to the U.S. House of Representatives, winning election in  to represent the 10th congressional district. In , after redistricting drew his home in  into the district of fellow incumbent , Keating chose to run in the redrawn 9th district, which combined the eastern portion of his old district with new territory on the  taken from the  long represented by . Keating has been reelected five times from this district. As of the  (2021–23), he sits on the House  and . Much of his work has focused on domestic issues central to his district, such as the fishing industry and nuclear safety.\n\n\n\n\nKeating was born in , in 1952 to Anna (née Welch) of , and William B. Keating of . After graduating from , Keating enrolled at , from which he received his  in 1974, and his  in 1982. In 1985, Keating earned his  from  and passed the . He later became a partner at the law firm of Keating & Fishman.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1977, Keating was elected to the  from the 19th  district, where he served for a year. He was then elected from the , serving from 1979 to 1984. He supported 's successful 1985 effort to overthrow  as Speaker of the House. By the end of his House tenure, Keating became vice chairman of the House Criminal Justice Committee.\n\n\n\nIn 1984, State Senator  resigned his Norfolk and  seat to pursue a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office. In the general election he faced  Marion Boch, who promoted a plan for dramatic cuts to legislators' pay and hours, invoking the energy of the  campaign.\n\nKeating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator. He was elected with about 64% of the vote.\n\nIn his first year, Keating was named Senate chairman of the joint Public Safety Committee, where he led the legislative action for a statewide  pushed by Governor . He authored a drug sentencing reform package signed into law in 1988, lowering thresholds for possession charges and establishing new minimum sentences, including a one-year minimum sentence for first-time possession of  or  \"with intent to distribute\". The latter provision was widely derided by criminal justice authorities as excessively strict and vaguely worded.\n\nRedistricting eventually placed Keating in the Norfolk and  seat (1989–1994). As a vice chairman of the joint Criminal Justice Committee, he was a lead author of a 1991 sentencing reform bill, signed into law by Governor , that made it easier to try juveniles as adults and pass harsher sentences in the case of major crimes, especially murder. \"What is occurring is a shift away from the rehabilitative stance to a focus on the seriousness of the crime committed by the juvenile\", Keating said. In 1992, as co-chairman of the Taxation Committee, he successfully pushed a proposal to phase out the Massachusetts .\n\nIn 1994, Keating led a group of politicians in a failed  to remove state Senate President  from his position. Keating sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base, with crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies. Keating's campaign failed, but he said during his 2010 election campaign: \"The thought that I took on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, is something that is resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent.\"\n\nFurther redistricting landed Keating in the Norfolk, Bristol, and  district from 1995 to 1998. During his Senate tenure, he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, chairman of the Committee on Taxation, chairman of the Committee on Public Safety, chairman of the Steering and Policy Committee, and vice chairman of the Committee on Criminal Justice.\n\n\nSpeculation emerged in early 1997 that Keating was planning a run for  (DA) of Norfolk County. He faced two former Norfolk assistant DAs, John J. Corrigan and William P. O'Donnell, in the Democratic primary. Keating, whose name recognition was boosted by the attempted Bulger coup, presented his work on public safety, criminal justice, and judiciary committees as a strength.\n\nAfter winning the Democratic nomination, Keating faced incumbent DA Jeffrey A. Locke in the November 1998 general election. A Republican, Locke had been appointed to the position by Governor Weld the previous year after  resigned. With years of experience as a prosecutor, Locke portrayed Keating as a career politician and echoed his primary opponents' criticism of his experience. Keating highlighted a range of endorsements from police organizations, and from Delahunt, as evidence of his criminal justice qualifications. Aided by a Democratic-leaning electorate, Keating won the election with around 55% of the vote.\n\nIn his first year, Keating founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and coordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a  under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, in an effort to reduce court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit. In 2000, he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in  and  counties, and it was fully established the next year. Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Keating's office was the first in Massachusetts to win a murder conviction in a case that lacked a victim's body.\n\nIn advance of the 2002 elections, he was seen as a likely contender to succeed the deceased  in the , but he opted to run for a second term as DA instead, and was unopposed for reelection. He won a third term, still unopposed, in 2006.\n\n\n, as well as much of the .]]\n\n\nWith incumbent U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt choosing to retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the . In order to run for Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (in the neighboring ) to a rental property in .\n\nOn September 14, Keating won the Democratic primary against State Senator . In the general election, he faced Republican State Representative . In the wake of the  and the election of Republican U.S. Senator , the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. Keating's campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. Keating won the November 2 election with 47% of the vote to Perry's 42%, with two independents receiving the remainder.\n\nDuring his first term in the House, Keating represented a district that served much of the , part of the South Coast, and all of Cape Cod. With the state poised to lose a congressional seat after the , lawmakers released a redistricting plan in November 2011 in which Keating's home in Quincy was drawn into the neighboring , represented by .

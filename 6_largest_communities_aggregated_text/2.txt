The district includes most of 's ,  and  in , , as well as . A member of the , Maloney ran for reelection in  but lost the primary to 10th district incumbent  after redistricting drew them both into the 12th district.\n\nMaloney was the first woman to represent New York City's 7th Council district (where she was the first woman to give birth while in office). Maloney was also the first woman to chair the . On October 17, 2019, she became the first woman to chair the  following the death of . On November 20, 2019, Maloney was formally chosen to succeed Cummings.\n\n\nCarolyn Jane Bosher was born in , on February 19, 1946. She attended . After graduating, she visited  in 1970, and decided to stay.\n\nFor several years, she worked as a teacher and an administrator for the . In 1977, she obtained a job working for the , and held senior staff positions in both the State Assembly and the State Senate. In 1976 she married , an .\n\n\nMaloney was elected to the  in 1982, defeating incumbent Robert Rodriguez in a heavily Spanish-speaking district based in  and parts of the . She served as a council member for 10 years. On the council, she served as the first chair of the Committee on Contracts, investigating contracts issued by New York City in sludge and other areas. She authored legislation creating the city's  program, which established computerized systems tracking information on city contracts and vendors doing business with the city. Maloney also introduced the first measure in New York to recognize s, including those of s. She was the first person to give birth while serving as a council member, and the first to offer a comprehensive package of legislation to make day care more available and affordable.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992, Maloney ran for Congress in what was then the 14th district. The district had previously been the 15th, represented by 15-year incumbent , a progressive . She won with 51% of the vote. The district, nicknamed the \"silk stocking district\", had been one of the few in the city in which Republicans usually did well; in fact, they held the seat for all but eight of the 56 years between 1937 and Maloney's victory. But it had been made significantly friendlier to Democrats by redistricting. The old 15th had been more or less coextensive with the , but the new 14th included Long Island City, portions of the Upper West Side, and a sliver of Brooklyn. Maloney also benefited from 's strong showing in the district.\n\nThe core of Maloney's district was the Upper East Side, an area with a history of electing moderate Republicans. Their dominance waned throughout the 1990s, and by the early 2000s Democrats dominated every level of government. This was exemplified in 1994 (the year of the ), when a serious challenger to Maloney, Republican City Councilman , lost badly. No Republican has gotten more than 30% of the vote in the district since.\n\nIn 2004, Maloney faced a potential Democratic primary challenge from Robert Jereski, a former  political candidate and unsuccessful candidate for delegate to the  on the slate of . Jereski opposed the  while Maloney had initially voted for the resolution to authorize force; she later renounced the war, including at a town hall meeting in her district with antiwar Congressman , where her comments made headlines. Jereski failed to qualify for the ballot because his petition was found to have invalid signatures, leaving him four short of the 1,250 required.\n\nIn December 2008, Maloney hired a public-relations firm to help bolster her efforts to be named by Governor  as 's successor in the U.S. Senate. She toured parts of the state, but was overshadowed by 's promotional tour for the same seat. Maloney interviewed with Paterson for 55 minutes. Public opinion polls placed Maloney's support for the Senate seat in the single digits, trailing the front-runner, then-State Attorney General , although her bid was endorsed by the  Political Action Committee, the  Political Action Committee, '''' columnist , and other columnists and editorial boards.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Paterson chose Representative . Since Gillibrand is from upstate, many in NYC's political circles urged Maloney to primary Gillibrand in 2010. Despite leading Gillibrand in the polls, she instead ran to retain her congressional seat. A decade later, Maloney was the sole member of Congress to endorse .\n \nIn the Democratic primary for Congress on September 14, 2010, Maloney defeated a well-funded opponent, , a 34-year-old   lawyer, by 62 percentage points. That night, Saujani said, \"I'm definitely running again\", but three months later announced publicly that she would not challenge Maloney again.\n\nIn 2012 Maloney's Republican challenger was Christopher Wright, who took a leave of absence from J. P. Morgan to campaign. Maloney won with 80.9% of the vote, a margin of over 120,000 votes.\n\nIn 2014, Maloney defeated Republican nominee Nicholas Di Iorio, a financial contractor with Pfizer, with 80% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic primary, Maloney defeated Pete Lindner with 90.1% of the vote. She defeated Republican  in the general election with 83.2% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2018 Democratic primary, Maloney defeated progressive candidate  with 59.6% of the vote. In the general election she defeated Republican nominee Eliot Rabin with 86.4% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2020 Democratic primary, Patel challenged Maloney again, as did progressive Democrat Lauren Ashcraft and housing activist Peter Harrison. Erica Vladimer, a co-founder of New York State's Sexual Harassment Working Group, withdrew from the race before the primary. By July 29, 2020, it was revealed that Maloney led Patel by about 4% and 3,700 votes. On August 4, 2020, local election officials declared Maloney the winner of the primary.\n\nThe redistricting process of 2022 consolidated parts of the 12th and  Congressional districts.  Maloney chose to face fellow incumbent  in the Democratic primary race for the newly combined seat, and in August of that year lost the primary to Nadler by thirty points.\n\n\n , , and  in 1999]]\n in 2001]]\nIn 2009, the ''National Journal'''s annual ranking placed Maloney as the 114th-most liberal (or 314th-most conservative) member of Congress, with more liberal scores on foreign policy than on economic and social policy. Her score of 75.5 ranked her as modestly more liberal than the New York Congressional delegation as a whole.\n\nIn 2011, a ''Daily News'' survey found that Maloney ranked first among New York's 28 representatives for activity with 36 proposed bills, resolutions, and amendments. In the 2013 legislative session, Govtrack.us scored her third among House Democrats for \"Leadership,\" third among all representatives for \"Powerful Co-sponsors,\" third-highest in the New York delegation for \"Working with the Senate,\" and fifth-highest among all representatives for \"Bills Sponsored.\" During the 2014 election cycle, the ''New York Daily News'' ran a story that said, \"Maloney has proposed more legislation than any other House member, according to records\", and called her \"James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, giving compensation to  workers who have fallen ill, as big a bill for the New York area as any in the last decade.\"\n\nFor the 2015 legislative session,  scored Maloney first for \"Leadership\" among House Democrats, based on sponsoring the most bills. It scored her second among all representatives for having the most co-sponsors, second for \"Working with the Senate\" and fourth among House Democrats for having powerful cosponsors. She was ranked in the top 10% of all representatives for bills introduced (\"Maloney introduced 26 bills and resolutions in 2015\").\n\nAs a U.S. Representative, Maloney was a superdelegate at presidential conventions. In the 2016 election cycle she was an early supporter of former Secretary of State and Senator . According to her 2018 GovTrack Report card Maloney ranked in the 80th percentile among House members for getting bicameral support for the bills she has introduced; she ranked sixth among House Democrats.\n\nIn 2019, Govtrack.us ranked Maloney as the top legislative leader in the House. This analysis ranked her second among all representatives for the most co-sponsors on her bills, in the top 5% for the number of bills introduced, and in the top 10% for getting her bills out of committee.\n\nFor her tenure as chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee in the 116th Congress, Maloney earned an \"A\" grade from the nonpartisan Lugar Center's Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.\n\nIn 2021 the Center for Effective Lawmaking ranked Maloney the third-most effective lawmaker in the House.\n\n\n\nFollowing the , Maloney advocated for federal help for New York's recovery and security efforts. Her efforts prompted  of the '''' to write that Maloney was \"like a tiger in the House on every dollar due New York.\"\n\nOn February 25, 2019, she introduced her Never Forget the Heroes Act, HR1327 in the 116th Congressa bill to establish Permanent Authorization of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund Act. The $10.2 billion authorization was signed into law, establishing that both the World Trade Center Health Program and September 11 Victim Compensation are effectively permanent, with the WTCHP authorized to operate until 2090 and the VCF until 2092.\n\n\nAfter the  published its findings, Maloney co-founded the bipartisan House 9/11 Commission Caucus and helped write and secure the enactment into law of many of its recommendations to reform the nation's intelligence agencies ''Congressional Quarterly'' wrote in its annual guide, 2006 Politics in America: \"In the 108th Congress, Maloney reached out beyond her usual roles as a liberal gadfly and persistent Bush administration critic, helping win enactment of a sweeping bill to reorganize U.S. intelligence operations.\"\n\nFollowing the , Maloney helped secure the passage and enactment of her bill to reform the system for vetting foreign investments in the United States. She has supported Scientology's \"\".\n and Nobel Peace Prize laureate  in September 2016]]\nOn October 1, 2020, Maloney co-signed a letter to Secretary of State  that condemned ’s offensive operations against the -populated enclave of , denounced ’s role in the , and criticized \"false equivalence between Armenia and Azerbaijan, even as the latter threatens war and refuses to agree to monitoring along the line of contact.\"\n\nMaloney, who chairs the , called on FBI Director  to open a probe into social media platform , writing, \"The company was founded by John Matze shortly after he traveled in Russia with his wife, who is  and whose family reportedly has ties to the Russian government.\"\n\n\nIn response to a number of high-profile incidents of gun violence, Maloney sponsored two bills to address the issue. The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2013 would make gun trafficking a federal crime for the first time and substantially stiffen the penalties for \"straw buyers\" who knowingly help convicted felons, domestic abusers, the violently mentally ill and others, obtain guns.\n\nIn 2014, she joined Senator  in sending President  a letter asking him to insert $10 million into the budget for the  to resume research on gun violence and \"conduct scientific research on the causes and prevention of gun violence.\"\n\nIn 2022, as chair of the , Maloney held a hearing that examined leading gun manufacturers' marketing and sales practices.\n\n\nMaloney introduced a bill in October 2003 intended to enforce transparency in relation to military contracting in  and subject the  to . In 2008, after reports of corruption among military contractors in both Iraq and , she secured House passage of a further bill to create a database to better monitor all federal contracts, the key provisions of which were adopted into law as part of the defense budget.\n\nIn 2010, the , a government watchdog group, presented Maloney with its Good Government Award for her contributions to government transparency and oversight, including her investigations into corruption and mismanagement in the  and her support of a Federal Contractor Misconduct Database similar to POGO's.\n\nIn 2019, Maloney introduced a bill that would require corporate entities to disclose the identities of beneficial owners to , making it harder for them to hide assets and avoid taxes through a series of limited liability companies.\n\n\nMaloney has taken several actions on health care issues. Her measure to provide  coverage for annual s was included in the Fiscal Year 1998 federal budget. She advocated for providing federal support for medical monitoring and health care for rescue and recovery workers who were exposed to toxic smoke and dust at the  site after the 9/11 attacks. Maloney authored the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act and led the fight for years to push for its passage. In 2010 Obama signed the bill into law. It provides $4.3 billion in federal funds to provide 9/11 responders and survivors with treatment and compensation for their injuries. In June 2012, it was announced that the program would be expanded to cover care for a variety of cancers of the lung, trachea, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, bladder, kidney, thyroid and breast.\n\nIn 2015 when roughly 33,000 responders and survivors were battling an assortment of ailments, Maloney led the effort to extend the bill permanently. After a prolonged and very public push, a total of $8.5 billion in funding was included in the Omnibus Spending bill that passed in 2015 and extended the life of the monitoring and health insurance coverage for 75 years. In the 111th Congress, Maloney introduced The Breastfeeding Promotion Act to protect  in the workplace under  law and make it illegal for women to lose their jobs or otherwise be discriminated against for expressing milk during lunchtime or on breaks. She has advocated for international women's health and family planning programs supported by the .\n\nA co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Working Group on , Maloney serves on the board of the Michael Stern Parkinson's Research Foundation and previously served as an honorary board member of the .\n\nMaloney has promoted scientifically discredited claims of a . On several occasions, she has introduced legislation that would direct the federal government to conduct studies into the alleged links between  and vaccines. In a 2012 congressional hearing, Maloney equated concerns over a link between autism and vaccines to concerns over a link between smoking and cancer. She said that it was \"common sense that [smoking] was bad for your health... The same thing seems to be here with the vaccinations.\"\n\nMaloney's views on vaccines changed, and she led efforts to bring COVID-19 vaccine sites to North Brooklyn and western Queens. She partnered with The Floating Hospital and the New York City Housing Authority to establish a modular site to provide COVID-19 testing and vaccination services at Astoria Houses in northwest Queens.\n\n\nMaloney serves on the  and the , and is the Ranking Democratic member of the Joint Economic Committee.

A 2014 Social Science Research Network study estimated that since its passage, the CARD Act has saved consumers $11.9 billion per year. Credit card companies fiercely opposed the measure, but it drew praise from editorial boards and consumer advocates. The bill was passed as the  by both houses of the 111th Congress, prompting  to dub Maloney the ''\"''best friend a credit card user ever had.''\"'' Obama signed the Credit Card Bill of Rights into law in a  ceremony Maloney attended on May 22, 2009.\n\nDays after voting against cancellation of a $1 billion, 10-year subsidy plan for U.S. sugar farmers within the , Maloney hosted a  event that netted $9,500 in contributions from sugar growers and refiners, according to  records.

And in 2008, Maloney introduced the Minerals Management Service Improvement Act (HR 7211) as a House companion to Integrity in Offshore Energy Resources Act (S. 3543). The legislation would impose dramatically tougher ethics rules for the Minerals Management Service, which was at the center of a major corruption scandal stemming from its employees' relationships with oil company representatives.\n\n\n, and  speak out on the need to keep birth control safe and legal in 2005]]\n  at the proclamation signing for Women's History Month in 2008]]\n\nMaloney has been active on many other issues involving women, children and families since the beginning of her career. A former co-chair of the House Caucus on Women's Issues, she authored and helped secure the enactment into law of a measure to provide federal funding to clear the backlog of  for which evidence had been collected, but never entered into law enforcement DNA databases. The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network called it \"the most important anti-rape legislation ever considered by Congress\". Maloney's bill, included in the Justice for All Act of 2005, was named the  in honor of Debbie Smith, a rape survivor.

Maloney also co-authored and helped secure passage of bipartisan legislation to curb the demand for sex trafficking.\n\nMaloney introduced the Child Care Affordability Act of 2007 to increase access to child care by providing tax credits.

After years of effort, her bill passed and was signed into law in 2020.\n\nAfter Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA, Maloney and  introduced a resolution to recognize that the ERA had met all legal requirements to be considered the 28th amendment to the . In March 2022, Maloney sent U.S. archivist David Ferriero a letter urging him to fulfill his statutory duty and publish the ERA.\n\n\nMaloney has helped secure funding for major  projects, resulting in the commitment of billions of federal dollars for New York State. She has been hailed as a champion of the .\n\nMaloney co-sponsored the 2009 reintroduction of the  (, originally introduced as  in 2008) and the  () introduced in 2011. Both bills aim to reverse the 's Public Access Policy, which   to -funded research. Some scientists criticized the -backed Research Works Act. In a ''New York Times'' op-ed, Michael Eisen said the bill would force the public to pay $15–$30 per paper to read the results of research they had already paid for as taxpayers. (Such results must now be published in  (PMC) after an embargo period of up to 12 months; this embargo period was imposed to minimize financial harm to publishers who were concerned that their readership would diminish if the results appeared concurrently in PMC, though authors of the paper are required to submit their papers to PMC as soon as their paper gets accepted for publication by a peer-review journal.) Some have suggested that Maloney supports the measure because she is the recipient of campaign contributions from , the largest scholarly publishing company. On February 27, 2012, following a , Maloney wrote to her constituents, \"it is important to be mindful of the impact of various industries on job creation and retention. New York State is home to more than 300 publishers that employ more than 12,000 New Yorkers, many of whom live in or around New York City in my district. New York City scientific publishers represent a significant subset of the total, and more than 20 are located in Manhattan, publishing thousands of scientific journals and employing thousands of New Yorkers.\" Elsevier withdrew its support for the legislation.\n\nIn 2021, Maloney protested the expansion of the , a nonprofit biomedical research facility, from a three-story-headquarters to a 16-story tower on Manhattan's Upper East Side.\n\n\n*\n**\n**\n* (chair)\n** As chair of the full committee, Maloney may serve as an ''ex officio'' member of all subcommittees.\n*\n* (Vice Chair)\n\n\n*House 9/11 Commission Caucus\n*House Caucus on Women's Issues\n*\n*\n*Americans Abroad Caucus (founder and co-chair)\n*\n*\n*Co-chair, Congressional Hellenic Caucus\n*\n*\n* \n*\n* House Pro-Choice Caucus\n* Congressional Skin Cancer Caucus (founder and co-chair)\n\n\nMaloney's ratings from various interest groups include the following:\n\n* The  (AAUW) gives her a 100.\n* NARAL Pro-Choice America gives her a 100.\n* Drug Policy Action gives her an A for 2015/2016.\n*  gives her a 100.\n* The Human Rights Campaign gives her a 100.\n* The Alliance for Retired Americans gives her a 100.\n* The League of Conservation Voters gives her a 96 for 2013 and 95 lifetime.\n* The  gives her a 90 for 2011.\n* The  gives her an A.\n* The  gives her a 100.\n* The  (AFSCME) gives her a 100.\n* The  gave her a 2019 core of 90%, and a lifetime score of 97%.\n* The  gave her a 100+ rating in 2013, and a 100 in 2020.\n* The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gives her a 100.\n* The NRA gives her an F.\n* The  gave her an F in 2010.\n\n\n\n\nOn October 16, 2001, Maloney wore an   while giving a  in the  in support of Afghan women's rights and  against the .

He served from 1973 until 1976 in the 67th Precinct, whereupon he was laid off due to the . He was rehired in 1978. In 1978, Golden faced an Internal Affairs Investigation and a disciplinary proceeding for losing his service weapon, which he claimed was a result of his mother discarding the firearm along with an old train set while he was away \"on a vacation cruise\". According to Golden, he suffered a career-ending injury in 1981; while witnessing a suspected drug deal, he chased the suspect, was struck by a car, and suffered a broken arm and ligament damage to his legs. Golden has said that he retired the following year and received a three-quarters disability pension.\n\n\nFrom 1998 through 2002, Golden represented the  of the . Golden was first elected to represent Brooklyn's  in 2002. The 22nd State Senate district includes the neighborhoods of , , , , , , , and parts of ,  and .\n\nIn 2011, Golden voted against legalizing same-sex marriage in New York, stating that he considered it a \"destruction of the sacrament of marriage.\"\n\nGolden voted in favor of the gun control law known as the  in January 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Golden was a vocal opponent of traffic enforcement cameras. In 2017, he described plans to expand the number of speed cameras near public schools in New York City as \"non-starters\". While in May 2018, he stated support for legislation that would double the number of speed cameras in New York City, this concession came only after Republican members of the State Senate worked to reduce the number of speed cameras from the proposed 750 to just 290. In June 2018, Golden co-sponsored legislation to eliminate all speed cameras after six months.\n\nIn February 2015, the ''New York Post'' reported that Golden had \"proposed legislation requiring the state Health Department to inspect abortion clinics at least once every two years.\"\n\nFollowing the murder of NYPD Officer Randolph Holder in 2015, Golden proposed legislation that would prevent anyone with two or more felony convictions from entering a drug treatment program as an alternative to imprisonment. Tyrone Howard, the killer of Officer Holder, had a long history of arrests but was still allowed into a diversion program in early 2015. The bill passed the Senate in 2017.\n\nIn June 2017, approximately 150 protesters rallied outside Golden's office in support of the New York Health Act, an act to establish a single-payer healthcare system in New York.\nGolden and his staff reportedly declined the protesters' request for him to hold a healthcare townhall.\n\n\nGolden has been a vocal opponent of a proposed hotel that would sit directly across from a P.S. 104 in . Golden stated, \"We don't want to put a hotel where we so desperately need classrooms\". Since March 2018, Golden has attended three protests at the vacant lot. Golden started a petition online to help garner more support for the protest of the proposed hotel.\n\nIn September 2018, ''The New York Times'' described Golden as a \"popular figure\" in his district who has \"consistently won support from both Republicans and Democrats, who know him for his omnipresence at scholarship dinners and senior citizens' birthday parties\". He ran unopposed in four of his elections, even though Democrats hold a two-to-one voter registration advantage in the district.\n\nIn his 2018 re-election bid, Golden was defeated by Democratic challenger  by 1,100 votes.\n\n\nOn August 6, 2005, Golden struck a 74-year-old woman with his SUV when she attempted to cross the street against the light. Golden provided help to the woman, and witnesses said he \"was visibly shaken by the accident.\" Later that night, he \"went to the hospital to check on her condition.\" The NYPD determined Golden was not at fault and no charges were filed. The woman died six months later, and Golden paid her family $750,000 to settle a lawsuit.\n\nIn 2011, the '''' reported that Golden spent just under $40,000 in campaign funds at the Bay Ridge Manor, a catering hall in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn owned by Golden's brother. Golden sold the business to his brother in 2002. As of August 2011, Golden still owned the building that housed the Bay Ridge Manor and still received rent from his brother for the Manor. An investigation revealed that since Golden became Senator in 2002, he had paid $355,000 in campaign money to the Bay Ridge Manor. Golden denied nepotism, but was criticized by Michael Murphy, Susan Lerner, and other politicians. In 2014, Golden's campaign finances were the subject of an investigation by then-U.S. Attorney . In December 2017, the Albany  reported that Golden had spent more than $797,000 in campaign funds at the Bay Ridge Manor.\n\nIn 2012, Golden advertised an etiquette class for women to help them be successful in the workplace that included strategies such as \"walking up and down stairs elegantly\" and \"sitting, standing, and walking like a model\". This event, which was taxpayer-funded, was heavily criticized, and Golden eventually cancelled it.\n\nIn July 2015, Senator Golden made a controversial joke on his Facebook page regarding marijuana and same-sex marriage, stating \"It all makes sense now. Gay marriage and marijuana being legalized on the same day. Leviticus 20:13 – 'if a man lays with another man he should be stoned.' We've just been interpreting it wrong all these years,\" Golden has since deleted this comment.\n\nIn February 2017, Goldenspeaking in defense of President Donald Trump's inaccurately claimed that a number of the terrorists involved in the 9-11 attacks lived in Bay Ridge. Golden's spokesman, John Quaglione, later claimed that Golden had confused the 9-11 attacks with the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center; one of the 1993 attackers had, in fact, lived in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.\n\nIn June 2017, while endorsing his staffer, John Quaglione, in a local City Council race, Golden was overheard referring derisively to one of Quaglione's Democratic challengers as \"Fat Boy\" in front of reporters, warning a reporter present who had taken note of the gaffe not to print it or \"[she] would never have a sit-down with [him] again.\"\n\nIn December 2017, Brian Howald, a bicyclist and member of 's transportation committee, alleged that Golden, while a passenger in a vehicle that was driving illegally in the bicycle lane, impersonated a police officer and threatened to arrest him if he did not yield to Golden's vehicle. The '''' reported that Golden's car's plate number was associated with \"more than 30 traffic violations over the last four years.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting at  in  in 2018, Golden fired a staffer named Anthony Testaverde who had shared Twitter posts comparing  to Hitler and .\n\n\n\n\n\n* Official website.\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

One incident involved Guardian Angels member Frank Melvin, who was fatally shot by a  police officer in December 1981 after an officer claimed they mistook his unzipping of his jacket – to display his Guardian Angels emblem – as a threat.

Some of his endorsements included the Bronx GOP, Brooklyn GOP, Manhattan GOP, Queens GOP, and Staten Island GOP, as well as the ''New York Daily News'', which, on February 20, 2019, wrote \"Ulrich stands apart on a key issue of the day: He welcomed Amazon coming to Long Island City as the rest of the field was tripping over itself to denounce the deal.\"\n\nIn February 2019, ''New York Post'' contributor John Podhoretz wrote a column entitled \"A Republican with a real chance to win an NYC-wide office,\" which was featured in the ''New York Post''. Podhoretz's column cited private polling that showed Ulrich leading the field with 22 percent of the vote, giving him “a real shot at winning” the special election. However, Ulrich finished second in the special election with 19% of the vote;  won the race with 33%.\n\n\nOn January 5, 2022 Ulrich was named as Senior Advisor to the Mayor by New York City Mayor .

It's my responsibility. Nobody else's. I have also learned what monsters the press can be.\"\n\n\n\n\nPaladino was defeated by Cuomo in the general election, 63%–33%. Paladino won all eight counties in the  but only a few counties outside of that region, all of which were rural upstate counties. Paladino did help the Conservative Party gain third place on the ballot for the first time since losing the line in 1998. The Taxpayers line failed to achieve 50,000 votes, in part due to poor ballot location (the line was last on the ballot and on most ballots was placed in a second column).\n\nPaladino's strong showing in the west propelled Erie County into first place in the New York Republican Party's vote weighting; following the election, its votes would count 11.53% in state party votes, up from the previous 6.98%. After the election, Paladino said this was the last time he would run as a candidate for governor.\n\n\nIn February 2013, Paladino announced his candidacy for the  seat on the school board of . A longtime vocal critic of the school board, Paladino chose to run in opposition to teachers union head Phil Rumore and superintendent Pamela Brown, whose hiring (as well as every other non-interim superintendent hire in the past two decades) Paladino has speculated was at least partially motivated by race. In the May 2013 election, Paladino defeated Adrian Harris by a 4 to 1 margin, and was sworn in on July 1.\n\nIn May 2016, Paladino won re-election to the School Board; he defeated 18-year-old Austin Harig of South Buffalo, a  senior. Paladino won by 132 votes.Jay Rey, , ''The Buffalo News'' (May 11, 2016). Although Paladino won reelection, several of his allies on the board lost re-election, and Paladino went from being part of a 5–4 majority to being part of a 6–3 minority. Harig won the support of the Buffalo Teachers Federation and , while Paladino received the endorsement of ''The Buffalo News'' editorial board, which wrote: \"Despite all his defects – his offensive comments, his bullying, his sometime inability to function effectively on the board – it is because of his influence that the board is even interested in turning around an underperforming district.\"\n\n\nOn December 23, 2016, Paladino took part in an interview with alternative weekly newspaper ''''. When asked what he would like to see happen in 2017, Paladino replied it was  dying of , stating: \"Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a . He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to [senior White House advisor] ], who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a   cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her.\" After then being asked \"what he would most like to see go in 2017\", he replied: \". I'd like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.\"\n\nThe statements sparked immediate backlash and outrage. New York Governor  released a statement calling Paladino's remarks \"racist, ugly, reprehensible remarks,\" while Buffalo School Board president Barbara Nevergold called for Paladino to be ousted from his position, arguing that if a student had made Paladino's comments on social media, they would have been suspended.   Mark Poloncarz called for Paladino to resign and Trump's transition team called his comments \"absolutely reprehensible\".\n\nOn December 23, Paladino was contacted by '''', who inquired whether he really made the comments. Paladino replied \"of course I did\" and told the editors to \"go fuck themselves\" for making the inquiry. Paladino later posted a \"defiant\" apology on Facebook.\n\nOn December 28, the school board demanded Paladino's ouster in a resolution signed by six members of the nine-member board. The resolution stated: \"These unambiguously racist, morally repugnant, flagrantly disrespectful, inflammatory and inexcusable comments by Mr. Paladino have garnered both local, national, and international attention that reflects negatively on the Buffalo Board of Education, the City of Buffalo and its leadership and its citizens.\" The resolution called upon State Education Commissioner  to remove Paladino if he refused to resign. Under state law, the Education Commissioner may remove a board member from office for a violation of the law or willful neglect of duty; the board argues that Paladino's statement violates the , \"which requires school districts to provide students with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and bullying.\"\n\nSubsequently, four groups filed separate petitions to Elia to remove Paladino from office: (1) the school board; (2) the teachers' union (the Buffalo Teachers Federation and the ); the (3) Buffalo Parent-Teacher Organization and Buffalo  chapter; and (4) the District Parent Coordinating Council. Two petitions also sought, as an interim measure, the immediate suspension of Paladino's functions as a board member.Jay Rey & Jay Tokasz, , ''Buffalo News'' (February 3, 2017). Several of the petitions argue for Paladino's removal on the basis of his public sharing of information discussed in  related to negotiations for a new contract with Buffalo teachers.Jay Rey, , ''Buffalo News'' (April 4, 2017).\n\nIn February 2017, Elia declined to immediately suspend Paladino from the board, as the State Education Department continued to review the petitions seeking Paladino's permanent removal. In April 2017, Paladino filed papers with the commissioner seeking a delay in the administrative hearings against him while he pursues a lawsuit claiming a conspiracy to remove him from the school board. Demonstrators continued to advocate for Paladino's removal.\n\nAfter the public hearing, Elia announced Paladino's removal from the board on August 17, 2017, effective immediately, citing the violation of executive session rules.\n\n\nPaladino lives in , and said he was considering a run in ; instead, he later endorsed eventual Republican nominee , who lost to .\n\nIn October 2011, Paladino filed a lawsuit against  and  (the primary electric and telephone utilities in Western New York, respectively) for what he alleged were exorbitant fees which the two companies charged for services. He alleged that the  failed to prevent \"collusion, overbilling, mis-billing and fraud.\"\n\nPaladino filed a lawsuit against  in July 2012, citing abuse of  and lack of transparency in the process of awarding a contract to the district's new superintendent. The lawsuit was thrown out of court within a week of its filing; Paladino said he would appeal the decision.\n\nPaladino endorsed  in the  and campaigned for him in New Hampshire. He also campaigned for Gingrich in New York; Paladino's impact was noted in Niagara, Cattaraugus and Wyoming Counties, counties that Paladino had carried in 2010; Gingrich, despite no longer being a serious contender for the nomination, polled strongly enough to prevent Romney (who was already the presumptive nominee at the time) from gaining a majority in those counties.\n\nPaladino made endorsements in the , selecting three primary opponents against incumbent Republicans: Kevin Stocker against , Neil DeCarlo against , and Johnny Destino against . All three candidates lost.\n\nPaladino endorsed  in the  and was the New York co-chair of Trump's campaign.Mark Weiner, , '''' (Syracuse) (August 5, 2016). Paladino aggressively pushed and threatened Republicans in New York's delegation to Congress and the State Legislature to support Trump, writing in an open letter: \"This is our last request that you join 'Trump for President' and try to preserve what's left of your pathetic careers in government.\" Paladino did not donate any money to Trump's campaign by late August 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Paladino stated intentions on Twitter to run for Congress to represent , after the incumbent representative  stated he would withdraw from the ballot that year in response to Federal charges of corruption. When Collins reversed his decision a few weeks later and remained in the race, Paladino did not proceed and instead endorsed Collins.\n\nPaladino endorsed incumbent Democrat  in the . After Brown was defeated by socialist challenger  in the Democratic primary, Paladino expressed support for Brown to continue his campaign as a ; if Brown declined to do so, Paladino stated he was willing to launch such a write-in campaign for himself (neither the Republican nor Conservative Parties, by that point the only parties with ballot access, put forth a candidate). Paladino rescinded his endorsement in August, instead advising voters to .\n\n\nAfter keeping a relatively low profile since being removed from the Buffalo School Board, Paladino ran in the 2022 primary for the US House seat from New York's 23rd district, after incumbent Chris Jacobs announced his retirement. Paladino was considered the frontrunner, but outside spending on negative advertisements and multiple controversial comments led to his lead's evaporation. Paladino's campaign used his trademark \"Carl Country\" signs. Paladino lost the primary to former ally , despite support from . Paladino has expressed interest in a 2024 rematch.\n\n\nFor the 2022 campaign, the ''New York Post'' reported that Paladino employed a known, convicted pedophile that was sentenced for possessing and promoting child pornography as the assistant treasurer of his campaign. The individual is reportedly listed on the NY State Sex Offender registry.  Paladino confirmed to the ''Post'' that he employed the convicted individual, who he called a \"good man,\" for decades and gave him a \"second chance\" after his conviction.  Following the report and Paladino's personal confirmation of his employment, the campaign spokesman then claimed without evidence that the convicted pedophile was not employed by the campaign.\n\n\n\n\nPaladino is  and favors adoption over abortion including in cases of rape or . Abortion would not be a legislative priority if he were to be elected, but he would continue to personally advocate against abortion. He opposes allowing minors to abort a pregnancy without the permission or notification of the minor's parents; he has also castigated lawmakers who have voted in favor of allowing late-term abortions past 24 weeks.\n\n\nHe opposes most  efforts related to the , believing they have destroyed small businesses and were an overreaction to a virus he recognizes as serious.

He has proposed increasing the frequency of constitutional convention referendums, currently set for every 20 years, down to 10 years. He has also expressed distaste for public service labor unions, which he has compared to , and is an outspoken critic of state laws such as the , which sets  requirements, and the , which gives unions significant negotiating advantages in exchange for prohibiting them from striking.

He also desires to see their positions declared \"part time\" and as such ineligible for a state pension or lifetime medical coverage; in addition, he opposes automatic  increases and seeks to force legislators to take an up or down vote on their own pay raises.

He also proposed supermajority approval of any tax increase. At the local government level, he would consolidate the operations of most s at the , with a single appointed superintendent, and also consolidate other local town and village operations at that level. He considered a solution for districts that span multiple counties. He did not support a reduction in operational aid for school districts and believed the budget can be balanced without reducing that aid. In response to criticisms regarding Paladino's existing leases to the state, he has stated a willingness to renegotiate the prices charged once the leases expired.

Liu and Avella had previously served together in the City Council, representing neighboring districts, and the two had a strained relationship.\n\nLiu criticized Avella for joining the , a group of senate Democrats that allied themselves with the Senate Republican Conference, creating a coalition that controlled the Senate. At the time, Democrats held a numerical majority in the Senate, but the IDC-Republican coalition prevented Democrats from holding power, while allowing Avella and other IDC members to gain committee chairpersonships.

As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%.

Cuomo did not discourage it, which many saw as implicit endorsement of the campaign. Cuomo went on to receive 6,577 votes in the primary, 3.92% of the total cast and subsequently asked the draft committee to close down, saying, \"I am flattered by their support and impressed by their commitment, but I am also convinced that in fairness to themselves they ought now to end their effort.\" The group closed down, but Cuomo refused to rule out joining the primaries later in the year, stating, \"I have said more than once that the nomination should go to someone willing and able to campaign for it. I am willing, but because New York's budget has not been settled I am not able to campaign for it.\" Ultimately, Cuomo did not enter the race and  went on to win the Democratic nomination and the general election. Because of Cuomo's refusal to run for national office, despite his popularity, he was referred to as the \"Hamlet on the Hudson\".\n\nAfter Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination for president in 1992, Cuomo was a candidate for vice president but he refused to be considered and did not make Clinton's final shortlist. He was also spoken of as a candidate for nomination to the , but when President Clinton was considering nominees during his first term to replace the retiring , Cuomo stated he was not interested in the office.  wrote in 1999 that Clinton came within 15 minutes of nominating Cuomo before the latter pre-emptively rejected the post.\n\nIn , Cuomo ran for a fourth term. In this election, Republicans attacked him for the weak economic recovery within the state since the early 1990s recession and the resulting high unemployment as well as his opposition to the death penalty by highlighting the case of , a multiple murderer convicted of manslaughter who was paroled by the state in 1987 and while on release became a serial killer.

His philosophy in leading the State was one of \"progressive pragmatism\". Cuomo and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives (Democrats had over a 3:2 margin in House) was successful in stopping U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration from eliminating \"federal income tax deductibility of state, local and property taxes\".\n\nDuring his second term as governor, Cuomo successfully pushed for the enactment of sweeping fiscal reforms for the State. Comprehensive reform measures were also enacted in governmental ethics for New York State under Cuomo's leadership. Cuomo extended New York State's economic reach in business globally, contributing to both strengthening and developing it., Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP (January 2, 2015).\n\nCuomo is also known for beginning the \"Decade of the Child\" initiative, an effort that included multiple health care and educational strategies to better the lives of children in New York State.  Further, in 1988, the \"Rebuild NY\" Transportation Bond Act was an initiative under Cuomo that was a continuance of efforts to rebuild bridges and roads throughout the State.  Cuomo increased assistance to local law enforcement agencies in order to help reduce or eliminate crime; and prison expansion in the State was continued which he is said to have regretted.

He was the first governor to support an ecological approach to families which was represented by  and community development as the goal of deinstitutionalization.\n\nHealthcare was also an area that Cuomo improved as governor, implementing initiatives that succeeded in reducing costs of prescription medications.  This endeavor assisted senior citizens in making the medications more affordable.  Under Cuomo's leadership, a public health plan that tackled the AIDS epidemic was the most intense in the nation.\n\nOverseeing programs for environmental preservation and conservation, Cuomo implemented aggressive initiatives in these areas.

The plan was for about a dozen gunmen armed with  and explosives to ambush Cuomo. Avola's , Aldo Ercolano, considered that Cuomo would be an \"excellent target\". Avola stated, \"The aim was to target politicians or members of institutions in order to send out a clear message... Killing a prominent American was a warning to law enforcement agencies that had allowed several prominent mafia informants to live in the US under assumed identities.\" This was several months after the mafia had already assassinated  judges  and . The attack was to be carried out in the main square of , Sicily during the day. However, after Cuomo arrived in  on November 19 with security consisting of many bodyguards and a bulletproof car, the attack was called off.\n\nCuomo's son Chris later denied the occurrence of said assassination attempt while guest starring on an episode of ''''.\n\n\nCuomo was notable for his  political views, particularly his steadfast opposition to the death penalty, an opinion that was unpopular in New York during the high-crime era of the 1980s and early 1990s. While governor, he vetoed several bills that would have re-established capital punishment in New York State. The death penalty was reinstated by Pataki the year after he defeated Cuomo in the 1994 election, although it was never put into effect and the statute was declared unconstitutional by the  in 2004.\n\nCuomo, a , was personally opposed to abortion, but he was  on the issue, believing that the State does not have the right to ban the procedure. In a speech at the  on September 13, 1984, he used the statements of the American Catholic hierarchy to make an argument: \"What is ideally desirable isn't always feasible,&nbsp;... there can be different political approaches to abortion besides unyielding adherence to an absolute prohibition.\" For this position, Cardinal  considered .\n\nCuomo was also outspoken on what he perceived to be the unfair stereotyping of Italian Americans as s by the media, including denying the existence of the , and urging the media to stop using the word \"mafia\". , an  agent widely known for his  as , wrote disparagingly of Cuomo in his book, ''Unfinished Business''.\n\nCuomo opposed the move of the 's  and  to the  in , New Jersey, choosing instead to attend the home games of the  while serving as governor, referring to the Bills as \"New York State's only team\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1995 until his death, Cuomo worked as counsel at the New York law firm, .

For that prosecution, Kaminsky was awarded the True American Hero Award from the Federal Drug Agents Foundation.\n\nAs a community advocate, Kaminsky raised funds and held free legal clinics following .

Kaminsky also introduced a bill passed by the Legislature that would require quarterly reporting on unpaid claims and unresolved Sandy-related cases. Another bill Kaminsky introduced, which would provide tax relief for victims of Hurricane Sandy who withdrew from retirement accounts to cover emergency payments, passed the Assembly.\n\nUpon hearing that National Grid was going to reinstate fees for disconnecting and reconnecting gas lines – fees that had been eliminated after Sandy to provide some relief to homeowners affected – Kaminsky wrote a letter to National Grid on August 21 urging them to reverse the decision. On September 10, after weeks of talks, National Grid announced that it would continue its post-Sandy policy of not charging those fees, in a major victory for Sandy victims.\n\n\nDamage from Hurricane Sandy was so extensive that the  had to be permanently closed. Kaminsky lead the push to call on South Nassau Community Hospital, the new owner, to reopen a full-service hospital in the former hospital's place. In early August, Kaminsky announced that New York State had given approval for a 24/7 freestanding  to open. The emergency department opened on August 10, 2015.\n\n\nTodd and his wife Ellen, married since 2010, live in Long Beach with their children, Rafe and Rory.\n\nKaminsky is the great-nephew of entertainer .

The  (the highest state court in New York) later found the law to be unconstitutional because it gave jurors deadlocked between life without parole and execution no choice but to give eligibility for parole after 25 years; the Court of Appeals feared that jurors faced with this choice would unfairly lean toward a death sentence.  In the 10 years after the law was passed, New York's crime rate plummeted without ever seeing an execution, perhaps weakening public support for the death penalty.  Silver let the law die in 2005 without much debate.\n\nDuring the budget process in 1995, Bruno (who was new to the Majority Leader role at the time) made a comment about Blacks and Hispanics who \"got their hands out\" pressuring the legislature to avoid cuts to social services.  According to the '''', \"Bruno said he was referring to the Black and  Caucus, which is a major force in the Democratic majority in the Assembly.\"  Bruno's defense was that he was referring to political caucuses, not all blacks and Hispanics; he offered a blanket apology for offending some people, but refused to take his words back.\n\nAccording to an editorial in '''', Bruno pushed a bill through the Senate on June 27, 1995, that would have required girls under 16 years of age to obtain consent from both parents for an abortion. The bill never passed the New York State Assembly.\n\nAfter , a  bill, languished in the state Senate for many years as a result of Bruno's opposition, Bruno and his caucus were put on the spot for their support of a socially conservative agenda.  people and groups pushed very hard for SONDA, and in late 2002, Bruno finally gave in; the bill passed the Senate and was signed into law by Governor Pataki.\n\nIn 2005, Bruno proposed research into  in New York State as part of a plan to boost Upstate New York's economy.\n\nIn December 2006, Bruno disclosed that the  had been looking into business associates  of Bruno's who had received state grants.  The FBI investigation appeared to lead Bruno to end one of his long-time consulting jobs in 2007.\n\nInitially,   supported Bruno's agenda as Senate Majority Leader. In later years, they expressed concern over Bruno's willingness to cooperate with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver on budgets deemed to be excessive, over endorsements Bruno received from state employee s (including  union ), and over Bruno's recruitment of former Democrats to run as Republicans for swing Senate districts in  and .\n\nAs of 2009, all 16 municipalities (two cities and 14 towns) in  had at least one building named for Bruno.

The electoral reverses and the ongoing FBI investigation led some Republicans to suggest Bruno might step down as Majority Leader. There were also rumors some Republican senators might cross the aisle to throw control of the Senate to the Democrats.\n\nIn April 2007, Bruno also appeared to hold  over two other Spitzer initiatives:  and .  Bruno challenged New York State Governor  to restore the state's  law.  Bruno also criticized the Governor's plan to issue driver licenses to , claiming it was aimed at stuffing the ballot box with Democratic voters.\n\nBruno's position became more tenuous in February 2008 after the special election loss of the heavily Republican 48th District in , which had formerly been held by Sen. . This loss diminished the Republican Senate majority to a single seat, and press speculation centered on whether the remaining GOP senate caucus would cause Bruno to step down.\n\n\n\nOn July 23, 2007,   admonished Governor Eliot Spitzer's administration for ordering the  to track Bruno's travel records, particularly his use of a state helicopter.

The ''Times Union's'' requests sought documents on use of state aircraft by seven officials, including Spitzer, Bruno and Lieutenant Governor , yet Spitzer's office released only Bruno's itinerary. The Spitzer administration and the State Police provided far more details about Bruno than about other officials to the ''Times Union''. No other officials were subject to the same scrutiny as Bruno.

Klein also served as Deputy Democratic Conference Leader.\n\nKlein served in the  from 1994 until 2004, when he was elected to the New York State Senate. From January 2011 to April 2018, Klein led the  (IDC), a group of Democratic state senators who formed a separate conference and allied themselves with Senate Republicans. Klein and his IDC colleagues rejoined the Senate Democratic Conference in April 2018.\n\nIn the September 2018 Democratic primary election, Klein was defeated by lawyer and first-time candidate  in what amounted to a major upset for Klein and his former IDC colleagues. Klein remained on the general election ballot on a minor party line and was defeated by Biaggi again.\n\n\nA lifelong resident of the northeast , son of Howard and Marilyn Klein, he was educated in Bronx public schools. Klein received his undergraduate degree from , an  from 's School of International and Public Affairs, and a  from the , where he was a member of the .\n\n\nA former chief of staff to Congressman , Klein served as a  State Committeeman and District Leader before being elected to the  in 1994. During his ten years representing the 80th Assembly District in the state legislature, Klein served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime and the Elderly, the Committee on State-Federal Relations, and the Committee on Oversight, Analysis and Investigations.\n\n\nIn 2004, after former State Senator  was convicted on corruption charges, Klein declined to seek reelection to the Assembly in order to run for Velella's seat in the New York Senate. In the Democratic Senate primary, Klein defeated then-Assemblyman . Prior to running for the Senate, Klein was reported to be considering a race for  in 2006, but did not do so because  and  were competing for that position. After two years in the Senate, he abandoned plans to run for the Majority Leader position, instead opting for the Deputy Minority Leader spot.\n\nAfter considering a race for New York Attorney General, Klein opted to run for re-election. In 2010, he was easily re-elected, defeating Republican Frank Vernuccio, a community activist in the Bronx.\n\n\n\nIn January 2011, Klein announced that he would lead the newly formed  (IDC), a group of breakaway New York State Senate Democrats.\n\nFollowing the 2010 census, New York redistricted the Senate, expanding it from 62 to 63 seats as of January 2013. The 34th district of  where Klein was elected was  to combine a majority white district in the Bronx with Jewish neighborhoods in  and in the . When all election night results were tabulated on November 6, 2012, it appeared that Democrats would hold 33 seats for a three-seat majority, their third Senate majority since World War II. Yet not long after the Senate Democrats' momentous victory, on December 4, 2012, Klein and the Republican Leadership announced a power-sharing agreement between the IDC and the G.O.P. in order to govern the Senate in a bipartisan coalition. Under their power-sharing arrangement, the IDC and the Senate Republicans jointly controlled the Senate legislative calendar (determining what bills would reach the Senate floor), made assignments to Senate committees, decided appointments to government boards, and negotiated the state budget. Sens. Klein and Skelos also agreed that the title of Senate President would shift back and forth between the two of them every two weeks.\n\nKlein was a prime sponsor of the 2013 New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act (), which enacted new comprehensive  measures statewide in the wake of the  in , and in response to .\n\nKlein was the primary sponsor of proposed \"At Rest\" legislation, which would require liquor sold in New York State to be stored in warehouses located in New York State. Wine retailers, New York wine producers, and smaller wine wholesalers argue that the legislation would drive up the cost of wine and spirits in New York State and significantly benefit large New York State liquor wholesalers such as Empire Merchants, which donated over $53,000 to Klein's campaign between 2009 and 2014.\n\nPrior to the 2013 state budget negotiations, Klein publicly demanded that New York increase its minimum wage as part of a final agreement. Klein's support was seen as critical to the measure's success, which will increase New York's minimum wage to $9 per hour by the end of 2015.\n\nLiberal activists working with the Democratic Party and the  targeted Klein in 2014, with  challenging Klein in a Democratic primary. Due to pressure from   and , Klein indicated in June 2014 that the IDC would rejoin the Democratic caucus after the . Klein defeated Koppell.\n\nIn the 2014 general election, Republicans won back the Senate majority. The election results meant that Klein lost his position as Senate co-leader. Though Klein had previously stated that the IDC would rejoin the Senate Democrats, the IDC decided to remain allied with the Republicans in the 2015 legislative session despite their conference's diminished role.\n\nKlein was a partner in the  Klein, Calderoni & Santucci, LLP, but divested from the law practice in 2015 and continued to call for lawmakers to give up their outside income.\n\nKlein and his IDC colleagues rejoined the Senate Democratic Conference in April 2018 at the request of Gov. . At that time, Klein was appointed to his former role as Deputy Democratic Conference Leader.\n\n\nIn January 2018, Klein was accused by a female former staffer of forcibly kissing her in 2015. Klein denied the accusation. Despite the allegations, Klein took part in high-level negotiations regarding sexual harassment legislation in 2018. The New York Joint Commission on Public Ethics (JCOPE) opened an investigation into the allegation, though by the time it went to an administrative hearing, Klein was no longer in the  State Senate, having lost his campaign for reelection.Anna Gronewold, , ''Politico'' (December 5, 2019).\n\nKlein later petitioned to shut down the investigation, pointing to findings by the assigned hearing officer that encouraged the commission to drop the investigation in June 2020. The findings concluded that the Public Officers Law under which Klein was charged did not apply because the alleged incident appeared to be isolated and did not affect government decision-making. In August 2020, the JCOPE voted 9–2 to proceed with the investigative hearing.\nKlein's lawyers attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed in January 2021. In March 2023, Klein failed to have the  (or probe) into the allegations closed by investigators. The Appellate Division Third Department in Albany ruled against dimissal on March 9, 2023. Klein did not appeal the ruling. He originally requested the investigation into the accusations against himself while he was still a New York State Senator.\n\n\nLawyer and first-time candidate , 32 years old, challenged Klein, who had held the seat for 14 years, in the 2018 Democratic Primary election. Klein outspent Biaggi by a rate of 9-to-1, spending $2 million to her $200,000. Biaggi defeated Klein in the primary in a major upset, 54%-46%. His upset loss was attributed by some to anger with the former members of the Independent Democratic Conference.\n\nAs New York's  laws allow candidates to appear on multiple ballot lines in an election, Klein still appeared in the November 6, 2018, general election on the third-party  ballot line. Biaggi defeated Klein again in the general election.\n\n\nAfter leaving the state Senate, Klein became a lobbyist for Mercury Public Affairs, based in New York City.\n\n\nAs of February 2018, Klein was romantically involved with , a fellow Democratic State Senator. Klein and Savino had been dating since 2008. Like Klein, Savino is a former member of the IDC.\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

McCall was the first  to be elected New York State Comptroller. He is an ordained minister in the , and is on the board of directors of several corporations. From October 17, 2011, until his retirement on June 30, 2019, McCall was chairman of the  Board of Trustees.\n\n\nMcCall was born in the  section of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the oldest of six children of Herman McCall and Caroleasa Ray. Herman McCall moved to Boston from Georgia and worked as a railroad porter; he abandoned the family when Carl was 11 years of age. Thereafter, the family was supported primarily by welfare and by relatives due to Carl's mother's infirmity. McCall graduated from  in Boston, where he was president of his class. He attended  on private and  scholarships, graduating in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in government. McCall was also educated at the  and received a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) Degree from .\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, McCall worked as a high school teacher and a bank manager. He taught for six months at  on  in Boston, and then joined the Army. He opened a church in the  neighborhood. By the late 1960s, McCall had moved to New York City. He was appointed by New York Mayor  to head the Commission Against Poverty.\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, McCall, as a member of the , backed by the Harlem political power of , was elected to three terms as a State Senator representing Harlem and the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was a member of the  from 1975 to 1980, sitting in the ,  and s. He left the Senate to accept an appointment from President  as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations with the rank of .\n\nIn 1982, McCall was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for . Governor  then appointed McCall to serve as the state's Commissioner of Human Rights (1983–84). While in the private sector as a vice president for governmental relations with  (1985–93), McCall accepted an appointment to the New York City Board of Education, where he was President of the Board from 1991 to 1993.\n\n\nIn 1993, McCall was selected by the  to fill the unexpired term of   as . As comptroller, McCall was responsible for serving as the state's chief fiscal officer, conducting audits of state and local entities, serving as the state's bookkeeper, investing the state's funds, overseeing the state's debt issuances, and serving as the sole trustee of the state pension fund.\n\nMcCall was elected to a full term as comptroller in  (defeating Conservative ) and was re-elected in  (defeating Republican ). In 1998, he announced that he would not seek election to the , helping to pave the way for the successful candidacy of .\n\n was quoted as saying that \"if  has a cold in the black community, Carl McCall has \", and it has been said that McCall was a \"stiff, bourgeois figure\" who generally did not excite the black electorate.\n\n\nIn 2002, McCall officially announced his campaign against  incumbent . After his primary opponent, former US Housing Secretary , withdrew from the race, McCall entered the general election as the uncontested Democratic candidate, but lost to Pataki. McCall remains New York state's highest-ranking black elected official and first black major party gubernatorial candidate.\n\nMcCall was the favorite of the Democratic establishment, but he faced a tough challenge from Cuomo which almost split the party. Cuomo proved to be a better fundraiser, and McCall's own campaign war chest was heavily depleted in the primary battle. Although McCall himself did not make any negative attacks, his close supporter, US Congressman , stated that the McCall camp would not necessarily endorse Cuomo in the general election should the latter win. This backfired as some Italian-Americans interpreted that as racism, and many of Cuomo's supporters refused to unite behind McCall after McCall won the nomination. McCall was endorsed by Senator . While Senator  did not officially take sides during the primary, she loaned a staffer and a fundraiser to McCall's campaign and she marched by McCall's side at the West Indian American Day parade in New York City, as the Clinton wanted to retain strong African-American support in case she made a president run in the future. Cuomo withdrew from the primary race after McCall moved to a double-digit lead in polls.\n\nMoney would prove to be a handicap in the general election, as  Chairman  stated that he would not channel large sums of money to McCall's campaign unless the gap could be closed with Pataki, which McCall never managed to do. In an unusual show of support, conservative radio host  urged his listeners to donate to McCall's campaign. Limbaugh said the refusal to give the McCall campaign money was a show of racism on the part of the DNC.\n\nCharles Rangel suggested that 's gubernatorial run in 2010 would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising 2002 gubernatorial primary contest against Carl McCall. Rangel said \"it would be immoral for the white attorney general to challenge New York's first black governor in a primary\" with the \"inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. Since we have most African-Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion\". , the incumbent and first African-American governor of New York, whom Rangel staunchly supported, fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election.\n\n\nIn October 2002, McCall released 61 letters he had written on state letterhead to heads of companies in which the state pension fund owned large blocks of stock, asking them to review enclosed resumes of his relatives and other job-seekers.\n\nSome of the letters referred to the size of the state's ownership interest in the corporation targeted, which critics claimed amounted to a veiled threat to punish companies that didn't hire his relatives. A Quinnipiac poll released October 16 showed that two-thirds of likely voters were aware of the letters and of those more than a fifth were less likely to vote for McCall as a result.\n\nMcCall defended the letters. Although he did issue a statement regretting the \"appearance\" and \"impression\" of the letters he wrote on government stationery, he maintained that he \"never sought to leverage my public position nor mix my government role with my personal and professional relationship\" in the letters. McCall's daughter, Marci, was hired by Verizon, which received such a letter, but was subsequently fired for using her company credit card to pay for substantial personal expenditures. Charges of larceny against her were dropped after some reimbursement to Verizon, and she was then hired as a marketer by McCall's running mate, Dennis Mehiel.\n\n\nMcCall was defeated in the election for governor by the Republican incumbent, . McCall received 33% of the vote, a low percentage for a Democratic nominee for statewide office in a state where the Democratic Party is by far the dominant party based on voter registrations. Some observers felt that this seemingly poor showing was in part due to the revelation of the above-referenced letters; others insinuated that McCall's showing was related to racism, especially in upstate New York. However, others point out that Pataki was able to make crucial inroads into traditional areas of Democratic support, such as unions and even African-American congregations. The three-way vote-split efforts of , who primarily ran against Pataki on , also diverted much of the anti-Pataki vote away from McCall.\n\nOther political commentators attribute McCall's defeat to the growing popularity of the  after the  of September 11, 2001, along with Governor Pataki's successful administration of the state.\n\n\nMcCall was a recent member of the Board of the  (1999–2003), as well as the Apollo Theater Foundation, Inc. Currently, he is a member of the Fiscal Control Board for  as well as the SUNY Board of Trustees. He also is on the Boards of Directors for TYCO International, New Plan Realty, TAG Entertainment Corporation, Ariel Mutual Fund, and as Chair of the New York State Public Higher Education Conference Board. He spoke at his alma mater 's annual  celebration in 2006 about modern civil rights and the legacy of Dr. King. He operates his own financial services fund called Convent Capital, LLC.\n\nIn January 2007, McCall was appointed to a panel, along with former New York State Comptroller  and former New York City Comptroller , to interview and recommend up to five candidates to the State Legislature to replace , who resigned as state comptroller due to scandal.\n\nIn May 2009, Convent Capital, the financial services firm run by McCall, was subpoenaed, along with other unregistered placement agents, by state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office as part of an inquiry into possible corruption involved in deals brokered between investment firms and the state pension fund.\n\nMcCall joined the  Board of Trustees on October 22, 2007. He was appointed to the Board by Governor . McCall was appointed chairman on October 17, 2011, by Governor . He announced his retirement in April 2019, effective at the end of June. He was succeeded as chair by vice chair .\n\n\nMcCall's first marriageto Cecilia McCall, the mother of his daughter Marcella (Marci)--ended in divorce.

This was in addition to his earning $120,000 a year as a state senator. That month, a coalition of 34 progressive groups hosted a protest outside Benjamin's home and sent a letter to   calling for his removal as chair of the Senate Budget and Revenue committee. They argued that his stock holdings and position on the board of NextPoint were unethical  that should disqualify him from presiding over bills dealing with taxation.\n\nBenjamin was the Senate's senior assistant majority leader.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Benjamin ran for the Democratic nomination for .

In the indictment, prosecutors also allege that Benjamin falsified campaign-contribution paperwork and provided false information on forms during an August 2021 background check, before his selection as lieutenant governor. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. \n\nPretrial motions focused on whether the facts alleged by the prosecution were legally sufficient to allow a jury to find a \"corrupt \" in accordance with  decisions that narrowly interpreted federal anti-bribery law. On December 6, 2022, U.S. District Judge  dismissed the federal wire fraud and bribery charges against Benjamin, although he denied the defense's motion to dismiss the two counts of falsification of records. In March 2024, a three-judge panel of the  unanimously reinstated the charges, saying that the charges had \"sufficiently alleged an explicit quid pro quo\"; the case has not yet come to trial.

Most recently, at Goldfeder's request,  Department of Urban Studies initiated a study in November 2013 to poll the opinions of local residents on the best use of the abandoned rail line. When the survey was completed, it showed residents' preference for expanded transportation over a proposed plan to convert the elevated train trestle into a park similar to the . It also showed that the proposed transportation link would serve up to 500,000 trips per day.\n\nOne of Goldfeder's principal reasons for supporting the project is its economic impact. According to Goldfeder, reactivation of the  would create jobs, decrease commute times to typically higher paying jobs in , and bring new discretionary spending from other boroughs into  businesses. The route would also fill a gap in the city's transportation system, providing the only direct rail link between northern and southern . Goldfeder has frequently referenced a  study on the relationship between mass transit and economic opportunity which revealed that neighborhoods with limited public transit options such as Belle Harbor, Howard Beach, and South Ozone Park, also limit their residents' access to jobs with social mobility. The proposal garnered strong union support;  100 Local President John Samuelson said, \"Reactivating the Rockaway Beach Line is the ideal place to start. It is the most sensible and practical solution to transportation inequality in southern Queens. It will not only improve inter-modal connectivity throughout the borough, but it will also multiply benefits for the city in quality union jobs, regional economic development, and fare revenues.\"\n\n\nThe extensive damage to  tracks during  left residents of  and Rockaway without subway service to Manhattan. As a temporary substitute, Mayor  put in place a ferry service from Rockaway to Manhattan. In July 2013,  extended service of the Rockaway ferry through Labor Day. While Goldfeder commended the extension, he maintained the position that his work is not done until the ferry service is made permanent.  As A train service resumed and city officials prepared to end the Rockaway ferry, the Assemblyman started a petition to make ferry service to Manhattan a permanent fixture within the Rockaway community. The petition gained support from thousands who signed online and was delivered to City Hall by Goldfeder himself.  As a result, ferry service was extended to January 2014. In 2014, Mayor  granted two extensions in January and June, with service slated to end by October. \nOn August 21, 2014, Assemblyman Goldfeder, Queens Borough President , community leaders, and dozens of Rockaway residents gathered outside city hall to call for another extension to the ferry line. Goldfeder said, \"removing the ferry would be just another blow to so many people who are still struggling to recover; it would be detrimental not just to one community, but to every Queens neighborhood who relies on the ferry for transportation.\" Despite 11th hour appeals made by Assemblyman Goldfeder and other elected Rockaway officials during an emergency meeting with Mayor , ferry service ended on October 31, 2014. Goldfeder said, \"We will continue to do everything we can with City Hall to get the ferry back.\" In his 2015 State of the City address, Mayor  announced a plan for a 5 borough ferry service in 2017, that would include a Rockaway ferry, priced the same as the normal metro fare. While he was pleased with the announcement of impending ferry service, Goldfeder said,\n\"It should not take two years to bring it back. Our struggling families deserve equal access to transit just like every other resident in this city and I will not stop fighting until this is a reality.\"\n\n\nIn the wake of Superstorm Sandy, many of Goldfeder's constituents experienced issues in dealing with their flood insurance providers. In an effort to assist families, Goldfeder sponsored Sandy insurance legislation in the Assembly to reform the process of providing insurance coverage, strengthen homeowners' rights and hold insurance companies to a higher standard of accountability.  In response to concerns from families still waiting on their Sandy Insurance payments, Goldfeder called on the five major banks handling insurance payouts to speed up the disbursement of insurance checks to residents in areas afflicted by Sandy. During this time, Goldfeder worked with colleagues in Washington to secure passage of  to delay dramatic increases in flood insurance planned under the .\n\n\n at a March 2014 Press Conference to urge passage of the ]] \nIn 2015, Goldfeder was appointed to the 's Insurance Committee where he promised to use his new role, \"to hold insurance companies accountable and make sure our families are treated fairly and with compassion in their time of greatest need.\" Following his appointment, Goldfeder introduced a bill to establish the New York Flood Insurance Association (NYFIA). The association would be composed of state-approved insurers required to share in premium profits and losses, and operating costs. It would be overseen by the Superintendent of the state  and a board of thirteen directors. In a 2014 op-ed, Goldfeder explained that his plan was inspired by the New York Property Insurance Underwriting Association, which was created in the late 1960s as a way to provide fire insurance to inner-city property owners unable to purchase coverage because of risks stemming from civil unrest and urban decay. The Assemblyman's legislation was motivated by issues homeowners in his district faced after Sandy, which included protracted fights with policy providers over coverage and recent reports of alleged fraudulent practices by flood insurance companies and the  administered by  According to Goldfeder, the proposal would help protect homeowners from being overcharged for premiums or dropped from their policies after major storms like Sandy.\n\n\n\nOn June 2, 2016, Goldfeder announced that he would not be seeking a fourth term in the November 2016 elections. Goldfeder subsequently announced his resignation effective Election Day 2016 to take a position at . In 2017, Goldfeder joined –based , where he served as  for Global Public Affairs until 2023.\n\n\nGoldfeder lives in Far Rockaway with his wife, Esther, and their three children.\n\nGoldfeder is an avid runner. He regularly competes in local charity races in his district and in 2014 ran the 15K .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Hevesi claimed that in 2003, the State Ethics Commission decided that he should pay back the entire cost of having a state employee chauffeur his wife unless such services were necessary for safety purposes.

He then won re-election in 2011 to complete the term, and again for his own full term in 2013. Wills renamed a street in his district in honor of White, thanks to the help of his surviving family.\n\nAs a council member, Wills mobilized his community behind several initiatives including removing sex offenders from a new homeless shelter near an elementary school, opposing the establishment of a homeless drop-in center near a high school, organizing a town hall to discuss body cameras on police officers, and stopping a juvenile prison from being constructed in South Ozone Park\n\nIn 2013, Wills went homeless to raise awareness of the plight of homeless individuals in his community. He pumped gas for tips and slept in parks, relying on soup kitchens to stay fed. The week long experiment was cut short after Wills reportedly developed pneumonia and was temporarily hospitalized when the experience became hazardous to his health. Wills later cited this experience as his motivation to push Mayor  to expand rental subsidies stripped from the city budget in 2011.\n\nIn August 2013, Councilman Wills secured 4.4 million from 15.5 billion of  and spent every dollar toward Education initiatives, making him the largest benefactor of schools in the borough.\n\nIn 2016, Councilman Wills also started a, first of its kind,  fund (13 million) that purchased distressed mortgages from local communities and renegotiated favorable  loan terms which allowed foreclosed residents to stay in their homes in efforts to prevent homelessness.

The charge was for operating an unlicensed construction business, also a misdemeanor.\n\nOn May 7, 2014, Wills was arrested as part of a corruption investigation. The charges included multiple counts of fraud and grand larceny in connection with more than $30,000 in public funds that went missing from a charity he ran. On February 2, 2015, he was arrested again and charged with five felony counts of failing to disclose financial dealings on five separate disclosure reports filed with the city's Conflicts of Interest Board between 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe resolution of the cases from 2014 and 2015 was delayed because Wills' lawyer was removed from the latter case due to a potential conflict of interest, and because of Wills' ongoing medical problems. After his indictment in May 2014, Wills also missed nearly half of his City Council meetings and hearings.\n\nWills argued that the vast majority of his charges stemmed from the office of  , who is an opponent of the Southeast Queens Democratic community and largely endorsed his primary opponent, future-Congresswoman , in the 2010 Democratic primary for New York State Attorney General.

But Weprin was criticized for telling the '''' editorial board in an interview that the  was $4 trillion (rather than $14 trillion), for unexpectedly bowing out of a scheduled debate at the last minute blaming the already-passed , and for his image as a product of the Queens Democratic machine.

Her request was denied.\n\n\nUnder New York City law, the City Council Speaker has authority over the yearly City Council funds, worth almost $400 million (in 2012), to distribute among 51 members. This discretionary funding system, sometimes called the \"slush fund\", has been criticized, with some councilmembers alleging Quinn to have cut funding to their districts as a form of political retaliation. She repeatedly denied these allegations.\n\nIn April 2008 the '''' reported that Quinn's office had appropriated millions of dollars to organizations that did not exist, and that the money was then secretly routed to organizations favored by individual councilmembers. In a news conference that followed Quinn said, \"I had no knowledge of it; I did not know this was the practice\". She said she had found out about it only a few months earlier, alerted authorities, and ordered staffers to stop the practice, but that they did not listen. Quinn hired a criminal defense lawyer to represent her in the federal and city investigations. Records showed that nearly 25% of those \"secret slush\" funds went to organizations in Quinn's district and that two of the biggest recipients had contributed to Quinn's 2009 mayoral run. In September 2011 one of the city council's lawyers reported that the federal \"investigation has been closed without taking up any action,\" but only after two councilmen were indicted at the cost of $100,000 to the city.\n\n\nUnder Quinn's leadership, the  Council led efforts to make Greenmarkets accept food stamps. She also opposed requiring applicants for food stamps to be electronically fingerprinted.  stopped fingerprinting food-stamp recipients in 2007, but the practice continued in New York City under the Bloomberg administration.\n\n\nOn December 26, 2012, Quinn wrote a letter to President Obama formally requesting that he commute 's lifetime sentence for providing classified information to Israel. She wrote, \"I know I share similar views with many past and current American elected officials,\" and asked Obama to \"use [his] constitutional power to treat Mr. Pollard the way others have been treated by our nation's justice system.\"\n\n\nQuinn was a vigorous LGBT advocate during her tenure on the City Council. In 2006 she boycotted the annual  Parade in New York due to the policy of the parade's sponsor, the , against gays marching openly. The same year she tried unsuccessfully to broker a deal with the organizers to allow her to wear a  pin. Subsequently, she was named 2008 Irish-American of the Year by the New York-based '''' and has boycotted the parade every year since, marching instead in St. Patrick's Day parades in other cities around the world.\n\nIn November 2009 Quinn urged the New York Senate to pass same-sex marriage legislation, saying that \"she and her partner, lawyer Kim Catullo, [would] not get married until they [could do so] in New York. Near tears, she added: 'This is literally a moment when people can stand up and say that everybody's family matters, that everybody's home is a blessed place and that everybody has the same rights.'\"\n\nOn July 28, 2012, Quinn sent a letter demanding that the president of  end its relationship with , because of the stance of the company's CEO, Dan Cathy, against same-sex marriage.\n\n\nAccording to '''', \"[for] years, Quinn opposed term limits, a position that helped her get elected speaker by fellow Council members in 2005. Once in the job, though, she commissioned a poll, and it showed that the public opposed tinkering with them. In December 2007, Quinn declared that repealing term limits would be 'anti-democratic,' a position she called 'firm and final.'\" But in 2008 Quinn backed Mayor 's effort to overturn the two-term limit for New York City elected officials, saying she had changed her position due to concern about the impact a change in leadership could have on the city's economic recovery. In 2008 the Council voted to extend term limits to allow the mayor, City Council members, and borough presidents to run for third terms, reversing the results of the two previous public referenda. Bloomberg was subsequently elected to a third term as mayor, and Quinn to a third term on the City Council.\n\nPublic Advocate , among others, denounced this move. In June 2009 the City Council approved a 40% cut in the budget of the Public Advocate's Office. Gotbaum declared herself a victim of \"political payback\" because of her opposition to the changes in the term limits law, a notion Quinn claimed was \"ridiculous\". All five candidates for Public Advocate showed up at City Hall in June to protest the move, and in 2010 New Yorkers again voted overwhelmingly to limit politicians to two consecutive terms.\n\n\n\nOn March 10, 2013, after much speculation, Quinn announced that she was running for . (, the incumbent, was term-limited and could not run again.)\n\nWidely viewed as Bloomberg's heir apparent, Quinn was considered the early frontrunner in the nine-candidate race for the Democratic nomination. During her mayoral campaign, multiple media outlets reported on Quinn's temper; ''''  reported that her staff had her City Council office soundproofed due to her outbursts. Quinn's rivals attacked her for reversing her position on mayoral term limits and supporting Bloomberg's bid for a third term in 2009. In August 2013 '''' opined that Quinn's primary chances were damaged by Bloomberg's \"tacit endorsement\" of her campaign, and in September '''' asserted that her change in position on term limits had also harmed her chances. Quinn's campaign faded as time went on, and she finished third in the primary. She received 15.5% of the vote, while winner  received 40.3% and  26.2%.\n\n\nIn 2013 Quinn's memoir, ''With Patience and Fortitude A Memoir'', was published by . It sold poorly, with ''The New York Times'' reporting only 100 copies sold its first week.\n\nIn October 2014 Quinn stumped for the Women's Equality Party established by New York Governor  in July 2014. When asked about the 's criticism of the creation of a competing progressive party, she said, \"Change is hard.\" In January 2015 Cuomo hired Quinn as a special advisor.\n\nIn 2015, Quinn became president and CEO of Women in Need (WIN), a nonprofit organization that is one of New York City's largest providers of services to homeless women and children. Her annual salary is $350,000. Since Quinn's first job was as a housing organizer for poor and homeless people, she noted that she had come full circle with her new job. Quinn said she was hoping to continue the good work of WIN's previous longtime leader, Bonnie Stone, and use a holistic approach to help women facing domestic violence, eviction, and other issues. Before accepting the position at WIN, Quinn fought against a homeless shelter planned for her own neighborhood of Chelsea.\n\nQuinn made headlines in 2018 for her comments about 's campaign for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Referring to her own 2013 mayoral candidacy, Quinn said, \"Cynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City\", and added, \"Now she wants to be an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York. [Being] an actress and celebrity doesn’t make you qualified for public office\".\n\nIn 2019, Quinn and WIN drew criticism from the press (including a masthead editorial in ''The New York Daily News'') for two contracts to operate homeless shelters in South Park Slope, Brooklyn. The allegations, verified by multiple journalists, included that the contracts contained up to $89 million of unexplained and apparently inflated costs. WIN and Quinn repeatedly declined to comment when asked for an explanation of the cost. One of the shelters opened in 2020.\n\nThough Quinn was designated an  in the , Manhattan Borough President  served as her alternate.\n\n\nQuinn resides in , with her wife, Kim Catullo, a lawyer. They married on May 19, 2012, and spend their summer weekends at a home they bought in 2004 in . Her former partner, Laura Morrison, was chief of staff to former State Senator .\n\nQuinn joined the board of , an organization fighting  in sports, in February 2014.

Subsequently, he earned a  degree from  .\n\n\n\n\nGaughran was elected to the  Town Board in 1983, at the age of 26. He became the youngest member of the Town Board in the history of the town.\n\nDuring his tenure, Gaughran was the lone Democrat on the Town Board. He authored bills creating municipal solid waste districts and enacting environmental protections.\n\n\nIn 1987, Gaughran was elected to the  from the 17th legislative district.\n\nGaughran authored a charter amendment which reduced the Legislature's authority to increase spending by adding \"pet projects\" to the budget; the amendment was approved by voters in a referendum. He also cosponsored a water protection bill preserving numerous critical areas in the county, a \"\" law targeting drug dealers, as well as reforms to the .\n\n\nGaughran was confirmed by the  to the Suffolk County Water Authority (SCWA) for a five-year term in March 2008. He was reappointed by the Legislature in March 2013 and March 2018.\n\nFollowing the retirement of SCWA chair (and former interim )  in May 2010, Gaughran was appointed as the new SCWA chair. As chair, he implemented reforms emphasizing accountability and transparency. He also reduced the payroll of the SCWA by 6% over four years.\n\nAfter his election to the  in 2018, Gaughran resigned as SCWA chair. He was succeeded by fellow SCWA board member (and former Suffolk County Executive) .\n\n\nGaughran ran for comptroller of Suffolk County in 2014, losing the general election to county legislator  by 6 percentage points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaughran first ran for the  from  in 1992; his opponent in the general election was the long-time  incumbent, .\n\nThe 5th district \"straddles the - border\", and includes the town of  and the northern part of the town of .

Although he had been perceived as a frontrunner for the , Cuomo declined to run for president, saying that he was \"willing\" but not \"able\" to campaign due to the unresolved state budget crisis.\n\nThe 1992 campaign was extremely bitter, with Marino accusing Gaughran of improperly conspiring with a fiscally conservative group called Pack-Up (an acronym for \"Political Action Committee to Kick out Unproductive Politicians\"), and Gaughran accusing Marino of using state funds to finance the distribution of his campaign mailings. The campaign was the most expensive state senate campaign up to that point, eclipsing the previous record of $910,000 set in 1990, and took place concurrently with a similarly rancorous  between the  incumbent,  , and the  challenger,  .\n\nIn the campaign, Gaughran drew a surprising contrast between himself and Marino: he charged that Marino symbolized \"clubhouse politics\" and big government in Albany, and that Marino \"voted for every state tax increase and every mandate on localities passed by the Legislature\", while Gaughran himself signed a pledge to vote against any tax increase. Gaughran also chose environmental protection as a signature issue of his campaign, highlighting Marino's opposition to a state environmental trust fund and saying that Marino was \"selling Long Island out on the environment\".\n\nUltimately, Marino defeated Gaughran with a larger-than-expected margin of over 20 percentage points.\n\n\nGaughran ran against Marino's successor, , in 2016.\n\nMarino had resigned from the state senate in February 1995 following his defeat in a senate caucus vote for another term as senate majority leader by , an ally of Marino's intraparty rival  . Marcellino had won the special election on March 14, 1995, to replace Marino, and had been reelected to ten full two-year terms, remaining in office since then.\n\nGaughran was unopposed in the Democratic primary. The general election was closer than expected, but Marcellino defeated Gaughran by 1,761 votes out of almost 160,000 votes, or about one percentage point.\n\n\n\n\nGaughran announced in February 2018 that he would seek a re-match with Marcellino, who was seeking his 12th full two-year term. Gaughran was again unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\nAn analysis conducted by '''' found that, before 2018, the last Democratic candidate to win a state senate election on  in a midterm year was  in 1982; Berman defeated  to win a third term before losing to Skelos in a rematch in 1984.\n\nGaughran was endorsed by '''', '''', and numerous local labor unions and activist groups. Campaign spending on behalf of both Gaughran and Marcellino was unusually prolific, reaching at least $2.8 million. Outside spending on behalf of Gaughran included $494,000 from the , $136,000 from the , and $15,000 from the New York State Nurses Association. An advisory from the political blog '''' to left-leaning small donors included Gaughran among eight state legislature candidates in key races across the country; according to Gaughran's campaign, this \"shout-out\" attracted more than $47,000 in individual contributions from about 4,000 donors.\n\nGaughran won the 2018 election, defeating Marcellino by almost 10,000 votes out of about 118,000 votes, or about 8.5 percentage points. Gaughran's victory formed part of the successful campaign by the  to retake the majority in the  for the first time in a decade, and just the fourth time in 80 years.\n\n\n\n\nGaughran ran for a second term in 2020. The Republican nominee was Huntington town board member Edmund Smyth.\n\nA  law passed in 2019 became a major campaign issue for Gaughran and other Long Island Democrats facing a difficult reelection. Smyth was endorsed by 23  angered by the bail reform law, as well as by police reforms enacted in response to the  in May 2020; the reforms included the repeal of a state statute that had allowed departments to conceal records of police misconduct. The police unions, alongside separate  groups including Safe Together New York (which received $1.7 million from businessman ) and the Long Island Law Enforcement Foundation, spent millions of dollars in advertisements targeting Democratic state senators including Gaughran.\n\nBy October, attack ads against Gaughran claimed that he \"voted to release violent criminals\" and that \"New York's crime wave is no accident &mdash; state senator Jim Gaughran voted for it\". Even as some observers noted that the claim that the bail reform law caused the increase in crime in 2020 contradicted official crime data, an internal Democratic poll showed that the ads were successful in damaging Gaughran's standing among voters. Gaughran responded with ads featuring him speaking directly to the camera: \"If the attacks they are throwing at me seem crazy, well, that's because they are\". According to Gaughran, the massive spending against him ultimately backfired: \"To be honest with you, it was very effective in generating volunteers [for Gaughran]\".\n\nAfter endorsing Gaughran in both his 2016 and 2018 campaigns, '''' endorsed Smyth in 2020. Assessing Gaughran's performance in his first term, the editorial board praised his successful efforts on the  cap and the bail reform law, but criticized his proposed bill to resolve local tax negotiations with the  (LIPA), calling it \"unworkable\".\n\nVoting in  was impacted by the ; many more voters  than in previous elections, which delayed the reporting of results. In New York, in-person votes were tabulated before postal votes, so a phenomenon known as a \"\" occurred. On November 4, the results showed Gaughran trailing Smyth, 55,132 votes to 69,015, a margin of over 11 percentage points. Election analysts estimated that Gaughran would have to win about 70% of the absentee ballots in order to make up the difference, but acknowledged that this was possible because the Democratic Party had encouraged postal voting while the Republican Party generally discouraged it. Indeed, on November 18, Gaughran overtook Smyth in the vote count, and Smyth conceded the election.\n\nThe final results showed Gaughran defeating Smyth by 3,135 votes out of about 167,000, or about 2 percentage points. Gaughran's victory in a competitive district helped the Democratic Party win a two-thirds  in the state senate in 2020.\n\n\n*Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse (2019&ndash;2020)\n*Committee on Commerce, Economic Development, and Small Business (2019&ndash;2020)\n*Committee on Corporations, Authorities, and Commissions (2021&ndash;2022)\n*'Committee on Energy and Telecommunications (2021&ndash;2022)\n*Committee on Higher Education (2019&ndash;2022)\n*Committee on Investigations and Government Operations (2021&ndash;2022)\n*Committee on Local Government (''Chair'', 2019&ndash;2022)\n*Committee on Racing, Gaming, and Wagering (2019&ndash;2022)\n*Committee on Women's Issues (2019&ndash;2020)\n\n\nGaughran took office on January 1, 2019.

Gaughran said the following about his rationale for introducing the bill:\nToday I took the first step and introduced vital legislation to make the property tax cap permanent. No more temporary extensions....\nWe're beginning to feel the devastating effects of the federal limit on state and local tax deductions.... It is critical that New York State takes steps to providing real tax relief to Long Islanders, while the federal government continues its attack on New York taxpayers. The Democratic senate majority is going to provide local municipalities and school districts with mandate reform and increase state aid to our region to help lower local tax levies....\nGaughran's bill was passed by the senate almost unanimously on January 23, 2019;  and , both Democrats, were the only two votes against Gaughran's bill.\n\nIn March 2021, Gaughran joined the other four Democratic state senators from Long Island in calling for |Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign amid . After an investigation by  , Cuomo resigned in August 2021 facing a likely impeachment and removal by the state legislature.\n\nIn May 2021, Gaughran introduced  to establish a public water authority in  to replace New York American Water, the private supplier which charges residents the highest prices in the region. The bill was passed by the legislature in June 2021, and was signed by   on November 3, 2021.\n\n\n\nIn his 2018 endorsement by '''', which is the largest newspaper on  by circulation and , Gaughran is described as a \"moderate and suburbanite ... who would protect Long Island against a New York City-centric agenda\".\n\n\nGaughran supports \"simple remedies\" which would reduce corruption in , such as:\n*prohibiting outside income for legislators,\n*closing a loophole that allows large political donors to hide their identities and to legally exceed campaign finance limits via s,\n*requiring legislators to reveal conflicts of interest,\n*banning the personal use of campaign funds,\n*allowing for the recall of elected officials via public petition.\n\n\nGaughran touts his experience with environmental policy as the chair of the Suffolk County Water Authority. He supports a ban on , and a reduction in  usage by 40% by the year 2030. He also favors measures targeting , for its effects both on food-insecure households and on the environment.\n\n\nGaughran believes that the  should be expanded; he favors banning s and extending the background check waiting period from three to ten days.\n Following the successful passage of the legislation through the state senate, Gaughran praised the efforts of activist movements such as  and other  which raised awareness of , saying:\nToday I have the great honor of hosting Linda Beigel Schulman and Michael Schulman, parents of the late Scott Beigel, who was tragically gunned down in  last year while heroically saving the lives of his students. I thank them for their tremendous bravery and courage in turning their tragedy into advocacy. It shouldn't take a tragedy to spur action. Never again.\nThe legislation was passed by the state legislature on January 29, 2019, and was signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo shortly thereafter. -->\n\n\nIn 2018, Gaughran expressed his intention to vote for the , which will establish a . However, after he was elected, he reneged on his promise to support the bill. In 2019, the New York Health Act was cosponsored by 31 senators, which was one short of a majority, and Gaughran and  were identified as two senators who had previously expressed support for the bill but declined to cosponsor it. In 2020, Gaughran's campaign website did not mention the New York Health Act.\n\n\nGaughran supports classifying  and expression as \"protected classes\", meaning that existing state laws prohibiting discrimination would then apply (''viz.'' forbid discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression). Gaughran also supports a state-wide ban on .\n\nIn January 2019, each of the 39 members of the Democratic caucus in the state senate, including Gaughran, cosponsored the  , alongside . The bills were passed by the state legislature on January 15, 2019, and were signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on January 25, 2019.\n\n\"Years of dysfunction in Albany have blocked the passage of critical legislation like GENDA. This week we broke the logjam and passed historic protections to root out discrimination with the passage of GENDA and end cruel, barbaric practices like conversion therapy.

In response to his vote in favor of the Reproductive Health Act in 2019, which expanded late term abortion and codified abortion rights statewide, the Huntington chapter of  asked Gaughran to resign as a member and barred him from participating in the  parade.\n\n\nGaughran favors overhauling the , which New York has formally adopted, saying \"this time we need to listen to our teachers, our parents, and our children about what works\". He opposes funding private for-profit charter schools with the public education budget. He cosponsored a bill to repeal the 2015 law establishing \"Annual Professional Performance Reviews\" (APPRs), which measured the effectiveness of teachers via the performance of their students on standardized tests; the bill was passed by the legislature on January 23, 2019, and was signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on April 12, 2019.\n In a statement issued following the successful passage of the legislation, Gaughran said:\n\"Public school teachers are the cornerstone of New York's excellent public school system. Teachers and students deserve fully funded public schools, not over-testing or the arbitrary linkage of test scores to teacher performance. We don't need annual tests to know how our students are progressing, we need to maintain local control. Our teachers are already evaluating student achievements every day in their classrooms, and perpetually modifying their lesson plans to provide the best education possible. I am proud to cast my vote to repeal the ineffective APPR evaluation system and look forward to fighting for increased education aid to Long Island public schools.\"\nThe bill was passed by the state legislature on January 23, 2019, and was signed by Gov.

And my father once told me that if he had had good legal help this wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nPerales went on to earn a bachelor's degree from  in 1962 and graduated from  in 1965.\n\nUpon graduating from Fordham, Perales worked at the legal unit for a -funded program on the  of New York called Mobilization for Youth. In 1968, when the federal government began to open neighbourhood legal services programs as part of the , Perales was selected to establish the first  Legal Services Office. His experiences working in New York's Puerto Rican neighborhoods allowed him to also assume the role of legal advocate for New York's Latino community. In April 1969, he represented the students who took over his alma mater, the City College of New York to demand the admission of more minority students.\n\nIn January 1970, he represented the  when they took control of a church to provide community services to poor community in . Perales negotiated the early morning non-violent arrest of over 100 members the Young Lords who refused to leave the church. \"The Young Lords were seen as a radical young Puerto Rican group that, actually in that situation had taken over that church and were offering breakfast to the kids,\" Perales said. \"These young people had a right to have a lawyer. I was doing my job as a lawyer for a group that I thought was doing good things.\"\n\n\n\nPerales has spent more than four decades in public service, including serving as the regional director of the  (HEW) in New York and later as Assistant Secretary of HEW during the administration of President .\n\nPerales served as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services under Governor  and as  under Mayor .\n\n\n\nPerales is a co-founder of LatinoJustice PRLDEF and established the first Brooklyn Legal Services Office. In 1972, Perales, along with two other young Puerto Rican attorneysJorge Batista and raised enough seed money to open the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a legal organization modeled on the . Perales served as the first executive director and Marrero was chairman of the board. In its early days, the fund, known by the acronym PRLDEF (pronounced pearl-deaf), brought many important civil rights lawsuits on behalf of Latinos living in New York City and across the U.S.\n\nIn 1974, the consent decree issued in PRLDEF's suit '' v. '' became central to the United States’ establishment of  programs in schools across the country. And, in several lawsuits against the New York Civil Service Commission, New York Police Department and New York Sanitation Commission, PRLDEF was able to get the courts to strike down numerous civil service requirements that kept Latinos from public employment and eliminated barriers to government benefits for non-English speaking applicants.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, a number of PRLDEF lawsuits, beginning with ''Lopez v. Dinkins'' on the local level and culminating with ''Ortiz v. New York State Board of Elections'' on the statewide level, forced election officials in New York to provide bilingual assistance. The litigation had national impact in 1975 when Congress amended the  to include the right to bilingual voting procedures.\n\nIn 1981, Perales returned to PRLDEF after another stint in government. Within six months, PRLDEF was at the forefront of litigation to get the  to block the election of the  until district lines were redrawn in a nondiscriminatory manner. The subsequent court order halting the elections was perhaps the most dramatic application of the Voting Rights Act in the North.\n\nPerales left government in 1994 to assume the position of senior vice president at . During his tenure at the hospital, he developed a Community Health Care system that received national recognition.\n\nIn 2003, Perales returned to the organization he had founded. PRLDEF quickly gained new prominence as an advocate and defender of the rights of immigrants. The fund's attorneys won a major victory against the Town of Brookhaven, New York in 2005 when a judge ruled that the town had to halt its policy of selectively enforcing its housing code laws against Latino households and its practice of evicting tenants without prior notice.\n\nThe group's case against 's anti-immigrant ordinance in 2007 was the first of its kind to go to a full trial, and ended with a federal judge issuing the precedent-setting ruling that immigration legislation is a matter reserved to the federal government.\n\nUnder Perales's leadership, the group was also among the first to challenge violent early morning raids of private homes by federal  agents. The organization has also filed a unique petition with the , arguing that the United States' aggressive immigration enforcement policies create a climate that fosters bias crimes.\n\nIn 2008, PRLDEF's board of directors voted to change the name of the group to more accurately reflect changes in its mission, its client base, and the make-up of its board. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund changed its name to LatinoJustice PRLDEF. \"Latinos are beginning to see themselves as a group, as a community,\" said Perales. \"There is a coming together of identification in a common struggle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A native of 's , Silver served in the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 2015. In 1994, he was selected as the Speaker of the Assembly; he held that position for two decades. During this period, Silver was known as one of the most powerful politicians in the state.\n\nSilver was arrested on federal corruption charges in early 2015, and resigned as Speaker of the Assembly shortly afterward. At his trial that November, he was convicted of all charges; the felony convictions triggered his automatic expulsion from the Assembly. Silver's conviction was overturned on appeal, but in May 2018, following a , he was found guilty on the same charges. After another appeal, the Second Circuit Court dismissed the guilty verdicts for three of the charges, but upheld them for four others. Silver was resentenced in July 2020 to  years in prison and a $1&nbsp;million fine. He was incarcerated in the federal prison at , New York. Silver was released on May 4, 2021, under a provision of the , which allows prison bureaus to release those deemed vulnerable to COVID-19, but was recalled to a medical-care specialized federal prison at , Massachusetts two days later on May 6. He died at a hospital in nearby , on January 24, 2022, while still serving his sentence.\n\n\nAn  whose parents were Russian immigrants, Silver was a native of 's . He graduated from the  on , where he was captain of the basketball team. Silver graduated from  with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965, and earned his  from  in 1968.\n\n\nSilver practiced law with the firm of Schecter and Schwartz from 1968 until 1971, and then served as law secretary for  Judge Francis N. Pecora from 1971 to 1976. In addition to Silver's duties in the  from 1977 to 2015, he was \"\" at , one of 's largest personal injury litigation firms.\n\nFor years, Weitz & Luxenberg insisted that Silver's ties with the firm were negligible. In 2007, the '''' charged that Silver's refusal to disclose the terms of his employment or the income he received raised suspicions of a . The income Silver received from Weitz & Luxenberg and the manner in which Silver obtained it ultimately led to his 2015 arrest on federal corruption charges.\n\n\n, and  announce federal funds for construction of the , December 2001]]\n, and  at the Israel Day Parade in New York, May 2004]]\n\n\nSilver was first elected to the Assembly in 1976. Silver advanced to the chairmanship of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee in 1991 and became speaker of the Assembly in 1994.\n\nDuring the election years of his speakership, 1994–2014, Silver's district typically re-elected him with 80 to 90 percent of the vote. In 2008, he had his first Democratic primary challenge in over two decades, winning 69 percent, or 7,037 votes, to defeat his challengers, Paul Newell, who earned 22 percent (2,401 votes), and Luke Henry with 9 percent (891). Silver was re-elected on November 4 with 27,632 votes. His Republican challenger, Danniel Maio, received 7,387 votes.\n\n\nOn February 11, 1994, after  died from a stroke, Silver became the . Silver served as Assembly Speaker until November 30, 2015.\n\n\nAs Speaker, Silver was instrumental in the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York State in 1995. New York's death penalty law was eventually ruled unconstitutional by the  in '''' (2004). The law provided that juries in capital cases would be instructed that if they deadlocked between sentencing a defendant to life imprisonment without parole and sentencing a defendant to death, the judge would sentence the defendant to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after 20 to 25 years. The Court found this provision unconstitutional, reasoning that this instruction would make execution seem preferable to juries because they would wish to avoid a defendant's potential future release on parole. Although no executions were carried out under the 1995 law, New York's crime rate dropped significantly in the decade since the law was passed. Silver let the law expire without much debate.\n\nIn December 2005, after two New York City police officers were killed in as many months, Governor  called for reinstatement of the death penalty. '''' quoted Silver's spokesman Charles Carrier as saying, \"He no longer supports it because Assembly hearings have shown it is not the most effective way to improve public safety.\"\n\n\nIn 1997 and throughout his Assembly career, Silver was a key advocate of state-administered  of New York apartments. This complex and highly politicized system made the Speaker a central figure, continually courted by major participants in the real-estate industry.\n\nIn 1967, New York City leveled the   Urban Renewal Area in Silver's neighborhood, and removed more than 1,800 low-income largely  families, with a promise that they could return to new low-income apartments when they were built. However, the site was kept undeveloped for decades afterward, as Silver and key allies, for example, the  strove to maintain the area's Jewish identity and opposed affordable housing, which would have brought more Hispanic and  residents. Finally in 2012, the site was approved for the  mixed-use development project. Construction is scheduled to be completed in 2024, some 57 years after the site was cleared.\n\n\nIn 1999, Silver was instrumental in the repeal of New York City's  on non-resident earners. The repeal was a benefit to those commuting to work in the city from surrounding areas, but came at a substantial cost to New York City residents. Silver was criticized by city leaders for removing the tax, and although he suggested he would support reinstating it after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he took no steps to do so.\n\n\nIn 2000, Silver faced an attempted \"coup\" in the Assembly as members, primarily from  and dissatisfied with his leadership style, tried to overthrow him as Speaker. , the leader of the backlash, lost his position as majority leader. An editorial in '''', written in response, criticized Silver for having too much power:\nThe problemwhich also exists in the State Senatecan be boiled down to a single overarching issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly with the other two leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.\n\n\nIn July 2007, Silver was skeptical about  's  program. When a meeting of the Democratic Assembly Conference indicated the proposal lacked sufficient support, Silver declined to schedule a vote on the measure, and it died. Although he stated that he \"probably would have voted for the bill,\" a majority of his conference opposed the proposed plan.\n\n\nSilver, in his role as Speaker, was widely blamed for the delay in passing legislation allowing professional  in New York State. New York became the last of the 50 states to allow the sport in early 2016, after Silver had been expelled from the Assembly.\n\n\nA former top aide to Silver, chief counsel J. Michael Boxley, was accused of raping two legislative aides while he was working for the Speaker, and Boxley eventually pleaded guilty to . Silver was sued for failing to investigate the accusations properly and for tolerating a culture of sexual harassment in the Assembly. In 2006, Silver and the Assembly leadership agreed to pay $500,000 to settle the lawsuit. Similar settlements in 2012 and 2015 resulted from multiple harassment charges against former Assemblyman , and Silver was accused of not acting forcefully to prevent Lopez's behavior. Silver apologized for not reporting cases to the Assembly's Ethics Committee as required, and said that since then he \"put in place new policies to ensure these incidents are dealt with swiftly and transparently.\"\n\n\n\nOn January 7, 2015, Silver was re-elected Speaker of the New York State Assembly for the 11th time, with almost unanimous support from the Democratic majority despite an ongoing federal probe into his outside income.\n\nTwo weeks later, on January 22, Silver was arrested on federal corruption charges resulting from that probe. He was charged with , , and . The federal inquiry, which followed the state's abrupt disbandment of its , focused on large payments that Silver received for years from Goldberg & Iryami, a law firm that specialized in seeking reductions of New York City real estate taxes for real estate developers. Silver was alleged to have persuaded developers who had business with the state to use the firm, which in turn generated $700,000 in referral fees to Silver. Investigators led by U.S. Attorney for the   charged that Silver did not properly disclose the payments from the firm on his annual financial disclosure filings with the state. Goldberg & Iryami's major client was the state's single-largest political donor. One of the firm's founding partners, Jay Goldberg, was Silver's former Assembly counsel.  Goldberg's partner at the firm, Dara Iryami, agreed to testify under immunity.\n\nSimilar charges were also filed involving millions of dollars in referral fees that Silver received from the law firm Weitz & Luxenberg. In this scheme, Silver was alleged to have directed about $500,000 in state grants to Dr. Robert Taub, a researcher in diseases caused by  and the director of the   Center. Taub then referred asbestos claimants to Weitz & Luxenberg, which paid Silver $1.4&nbsp;million in salary and another $3.9&nbsp;million in referral fees, although he did no work for them. After the charges were announced, Weitz & Luxenberg promptly placed Silver on leave. Both Taub and another of Silver's longtime associates, Brian Meara, provided key information to investigators in exchange for non-prosecution agreements.\n\nOn January 30, after a week of intense political pressure and dwindling support, Silver submitted his resignation as Speaker, effective February 2, while retaining his seat as a member of the Assembly and vowing to fight the charges against him. On February 3, the Assembly elected  as their new Speaker.\n\nOn April 25, 2015, Silver was indicted on additional charges of making illegal investments through private vehicles, netting a profit of $750,000. He pleaded not guilty to those charges three days later, on April 28.\n\n\nSilver's trial on seven corruption charges lasted for much of November 2015. On November 30, 2015, a unanimous jury found Silver guilty on all seven counts, triggering his automatic expulsion from the Assembly. The , which handles judicial and attorney misconduct, affirmed his automatic disbarment for the felony convictions.\n\nOn May 3, 2016, federal judge  of the , who presided over the trial, sentenced Silver to 12 years in prison, and ordered him to pay $5.3&nbsp;million in ill-gotten gains and $1.75&nbsp;million in additional fines. Silver received two prison terms: 12 years for six criminal counts against him and 10 years on the seventh, to run concurrently.\n\n\nAfter the conviction, Silver remained free on bail as a panel of judges considered his appeal based on the 's decision in '''' that reversed the corruption conviction of former  .\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in the McDonnell case narrowed the kinds of activities that could constitute corruption, and Silver's conviction was overturned by the  in Manhattan on July 13, 2017.\n\n\nAfter his conviction was overturned, Silver was retried on the same charges. On May 11, 2018, he was again found guilty on all counts.  On July 27, 2018, Judge Caproni sentenced him to seven years in prison, five years less than the sentence she gave him for his first conviction, citing his advancing age.\n\nSilver was due to report to prison on October 5, 2018, but this was stayed as he again appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While his case was under continued appeal, he remained free on $200,000 bail.\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the panel unanimously dismissed the three charges stemming from Silver's involvement in the asbestos exposure cases but upheld the four charges related to the kickbacks from Goldberg & Iryami and , sending the case back to Judge Caproni for resentencing. Silver was resentenced by Judge Caproni on July 20, this time to  years in prison and a fine of $1&nbsp;million. He reported to , on August 26, 2020. After being furloughed briefly, Silver was transferred to  in May 2021.\n\n\nA number of commentators reflected on Silver's political career in the aftermath of his criminal convictions. Sara Foss, writing for the ''Daily Gazette'', said that during his speakership, \"he wielded an enormous amount of power, while also using his office for personal gain.\" She attributed to Silver an \"opaque and autocratic style of governance\". Joseph Spector and Jon Campbell in the ''Observer Dispatch'' said that, \"for more than two decades\" Silver \"was one of the most powerful and feared politicians in New York\". In 2018, Daniel Leddy of the '''' wrote \"As speaker of the New York State Assembly, Sheldon Silver was corruption personified, an iron-fisted dictator who turned that legislative body into his own personal, profit-making enterprise. The full extent of Silver's sleaziness will never be known, nor will the identity of those irreparably harmed by it\".\n\n\nSilver and his wife Rosa, a former  schoolteacher, had four children. According to court papers unsealed during the sentencing phase of his first trial, Silver was alleged to have had two extramarital affairs, both of which were connected to his Albany position. Both Silver and the two women who were the subject of the allegations have denied the affairs.\n\nBy the time he became Speaker of the Assembly, he was known to play basketball with other high-ranking officials, including former Governor  and former New York State Comptroller .\n\nTwo weeks after Silver's first criminal conviction, his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch was sentenced to prison for a separate multimillion-dollar crime, also prosecuted by Bharara's office.\n\nAt the time of his death, Silver was imprisoned at the Devens Federal Medical Center in . He died at  in nearby , on January 24, 2022, less than a month before his 78th birthday.\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* Paterson, David (2020).

At Rochester, he was a member of the  fraternity.\n\n\nDuring his campaign for Congress, it emerged that Lee was fired from a sales job in Buffalo at  (now in ) when he was 25 years old. He had obtained his supervisor's password and accessed customer accounts to change their credit limits with the company; as a result, Lee and another employee were fired.\n\nLee moved to California, where he worked for  as director of sales before returning to New York in 1995 to work for Enidine, Inc., a company founded by his father and based in . He worked at Enidine in various roles including Pacific Rim sales manager, director of international sales and marketing, and then general manager. Under Lee's direction, the business was transformed \"from a small machine shop in western New York to a global enterprise,\" according to ''The New York Times''.\n\nIn 2003, Lee became automation group president of  (IMC) of , another company founded by his father. He oversaw the group's acquisition of the  firm Evolutionary Concepts Inc., and worked at IMC until it was sold to the  for nearly $400&nbsp;million in 2007.\n\nLee's father established the Patrick P.

The foundation promotes cancer and mental illness awareness, education, prevention, and research in .\n\n\n\nLee announced his candidacy for the  nomination for the  in  in April 2008. He was endorsed by the incumbent Rep. , who was retiring; ultimately, Lee was supported by all seven of the district's Republican county chairmen, who met in May 2008 to announce that he would obtain the party's official endorsement. His candidacy garnered the support of  Chairman  in an election year in which the Republican party was looking for self-financed candidates. Lee won reelection in 2010 with 76 percent of the vote in a district that consistently votes Republican, according to ''The Weekly Standard''.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Congress, Lee was a conservative who voted with the Republican party 93% of the time during his first term. He voted \"no\" on the repeal of , and \"no\" on the  and the health care reform bills.

He obtained earmarks for a small arms practice range for an Air Reserve station, high-speed rail, and local defense contractors. Lee was a member of the House Republican Economic Group, as well as the House Ways and Means Committee.

In , after 16 terms in office, Engel was defeated in the Democratic primary by middle school principal .\n\n\nEngel was born in , the son of Sylvia (née Bleend) and Philip Engel, an . His grandparents, of  background, were immigrants from the . He grew up in a city housing project, Eastchester Gardens, and attended  public schools.\n\nIn 1969, Engel graduated from the Bronx campus of  with a  in . He subsequently received a  in guidance and counseling in 1973 from the same institution, by now renamed  following the severance of its relationship with Hunter College. In February 1987, he earned a  from .\n\n\nHe began his political career in local Democratic clubs. He taught in the  and was a school counselor. He taught at Intermediate School 52 from 1969 to 1976, and then at Intermediate School 174.\n\n\nIn 1977, Engel entered the special election for a seat in the  after the incumbent Democrat  was forced to resign. He was the  nominee in the special election, and on March 1, 1977, he won by 103 votes, defeating Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel.\n\nEngel was a member of the  from 1977 to 1988, sitting in the , , , , , and s. He chaired the Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, and the Subcommittee on the .\n\n\n\nIn 1988, Engel ran for the  in . His state assembly district covered much of the congressional district's southeastern corner. He defeated ten-term incumbent Democrat  in the  with 48% of the vote, as Biaggi had resigned his seat and did not campaign for office, though his name remained on the ballot since election petitions were already filed. Biaggi had been charged by  with  in the , and was eventually jailed. Biaggi was unopposed for the Republican nomination (he had run on both the Republican and Democratic lines since 1972), which Engel won with 56% of the vote.\n\nEngel's district, which became the 17th in 1993 and has been the 16th since 2013, had historically been one of the more conservative districts in New York City. Republicans represented much of its territory at the state level as late as 2004. However, reflecting the increasing Democratic trend in the Bronx at the federal level, Engel would never face another general election contest nearly as close as his first one. He was re-elected 14 more times with at least 61 percent of the vote, and only dropped below 70 percent of the vote twice. As a measure of the district's growing Democratic trend, Biaggi is the last candidate running on the Republican line to clear the 40 percent mark.\n\nBy the 1990s, as in much of the rest of New York City, the Democratic primary had become the real contest in this district. From 1990 to 2018, Engel only faced two competitive primary contests (getting less than 70%). In 1994, he defeated musician  62%-38%. In 2000, Engel defeated State Senator , who had the support of Bronx County Democratic Party Chairman Roberto Ramirez, 50%-41%.\n\nIn , Engel was challenged in the primary by Yonkers school principal , who ran well to Engel's left. Engel initially received an endorsement from New York State Senator , Mario Biaggi's granddaughter. However, in early June, after a hot mic gaffe by Engel, where he insisted on speaking at a press conference and said, \"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care,\" Biaggi withdrew her support of Engel and instead endorsed Bowman.\n\nIn a mid-June poll, Engel trailed Bowman by ten percentage points and, after the election, with early and election day votes counted, Bowman led Engel by almost 12,000 votes, 61.8% to 34.9%. Absentee ballots were scheduled to be counted on June 30, 2020, though some sources called the race for Bowman before the counting of absentee ballots. After the absentee ballots were counted, Bowman's lead was 55.4%-40.6%, or 13,218 votes.

He expressed that, \"It's an honor to shake the hand of the president of the United States no matter who it is.\"\n\nThis tradition ended in 2017 when Engel decided not to shake then President 's hand.\n\n\n\n\nA strong supporter of , Engel supported quality access to , and referred to himself as  \"all the way\". Engel was a co-sponsor of the , which would implement a single-payer health care system in the United States. In 2010 he was a strong supporter of the landmark  once he secured provisions that  would not be penalized for providing more generous benefits than other states.\n\nIn 2008, Engel authored the  (P.L. 110–373), which established a national registry for the collection and storage of data on those suffering from ALS. He also authored the   (P.L. 110–361), which promoted research at Centers of Excellence for Muscular Dystrophy.\n\nIn 2010, Engel wrote the  to improve maternity care for mothers and newborns, and to do so in partnership with doctors, advocates, payers, and purchasers. In 2010 he also wrote the , which passed the House, but didn't come to a vote in the Senate. In 2018, he reintroduced the legislation in the  for consideration. It was not voted on. The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which, if untreated, could lead to  for both mother and child.\n\n\nEngel supported an improved re-authorization of the  (PEPFAR).

This measure would provide increased U.S. support for international  activities, and promotes research to develop new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.\n\n\nIn 2005, Engel, along with Congressman  (R-GA), introduced the Fuel Choices for American Security Act (H.R. 4409), later modified and re-introduced in 2007 as the DRIVE Act (H.R. 670) - the Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act - with more than 80 bi-partisan co-sponsors. It was designed to promote America's  and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean  and advanced vehicle technologies. It also called for increased tire efficiency - to increase a vehicle's gas miles.\n\nMany provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the , which was signed into law on December 19, 2007, and became Public Law No. 110-140. This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown s like , , and .\n\nEngel introduced the Open Fuel Standards Act, alongside Congressmen Kingston,  (D-NY) and  (R-SC). This bill would have required 50 percent of new cars sold in the  by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be s capable of running on any combination of , , or . Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version.\n\nEngel on the  and Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. He played a key role in negotiating the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454, which passed the House on June 26, 2009.

In 2011, after 400,000 defective s were recalled from the market, Engel introduced a bill intended to protect parents and children from faulty gun locks by instructing the  (CPSC) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms.\n\n\nOn December 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the . The legislation was introduced by  in the Senate, passed the House on December 15, and is virtually identical to Engel's bill. The new law cracks down on the use of , often used by criminals to trick their victims into giving out personal information. The legislation will help law enforcement combat .\n\nEngel originally introduced the Securing our Borders and Our Data Act in July 2008, HR 6702. That bill would ensure that when a traveler enters the United States, a border agent cannot search or seize the traveler's data or equipment without cause. The legislation was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as HR 239. The  altered their rules to prevent agents from searching and seizing without cause. This encompassed much of Engel's legislation.\n\nIn the 109th Congress, Engel introduced the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act, HR 3402. The bill was intended to stop some of the massive fraud in the prepaid calling card industry. The legislation passed the House unanimously, but the Senate did not act on it. In 2011, Engel introduced the , which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests.\n\nIn 2010, Engel urged the  to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on  sales. Some developers and investors had been  by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades.

The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Engel introduced , the Social Network Online Protection Act.

The bill did not pass the Senate.\n\n\n, in ,  in January 2015]]\nEngel was one of the leading congressional supporters of . Although he supported resolutions critical of both Israelis and Palestinians, his criticisms of Israeli policies were usually couched as warnings of their harm to Israel itself. In 2008, he was the lead Democrat on a resolution condemning  rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by  and other Palestinian militant organizations. Shortly after entering Congress, he sponsored a resolution declaring  the undivided capital of Israel. A very pro-Israel position, this was contrary to official American policy until President  adopted it in December 2019. He also wrote the , which was signed into law by President  on December 12, 2003. This law authorized restrictions on American relations with , and penalties for its occupation of , and for its relationship with terrorist groups.\n\nIn 2016 Engel was one of only 16 Democrats to join with 200 Republicans and defeat a measure that would have banned the sale of cluster bombs to  who is at war with .

From 1972 to 1973, he was president of the . In late 1973, he was poised to take office as New York City's first Black  in the administration of Mayor-elect ; however, the appointment was not effectuated amid \"difficulties that stemmed from [Dinkins'] failure to pay federal, state or city personal income taxes for four years.\" Instead, he served as city clerk (characterized by  as a \"patronage appointee who kept marriage licenses and municipal records\") from 1975 to 1985. He was elected   in 1985 on his third run for that office. , Dinkins was elected mayor of New York City, defeating three-term incumbent mayor  and two others in the Democratic primary and Republican nominee  in the general election. During his campaign, Dinkins sought the blessing and endorsement of Rabbi , the  Rebbe.\n\nDinkins was elected in the wake of a corruption scandal that stemmed from the decline of longtime Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman and preeminent New York City political leader 's -influenced patronage network, ultimately precipitating the suicide of Queens Borough President  and a series of criminal convictions among the city's Democratic leadership. In March 1989, the  (which served as the primary governing instrument of various patronage networks for decades, often superseding the mayoralty in influence) also was declared unconstitutional under the 's  by the ; this prompted the empanelment of the , which abolished the Board of Estimate and assigned most of its responsibilities to an enlarged  via a successful referendum in November. Koch, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was politically damaged by his administration's ties to the Esposito network and his handling of racial issues, exemplified by his fealty to affluent interests in predominantly white areas of Manhattan. This enabled Dinkins to attenuate public perceptions of his previous patronage appointments and emerge as a formidable, reform-minded challenger to Koch. Additionally, the fact that Dinkins was African American helped him to avoid criticism that he was ignoring the Black vote by campaigning to whites. While a large turnout of African American voters was important to his election, Dinkins campaigned throughout the city. Dinkins' campaign manager was political consultant , who became one of his first deputy mayors.\n\n\n\n, Secretary of Defense ; Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff , and General ]]\nDinkins entered office in January 1990 pledging racial healing, and famously referred to New York City's demographic diversity as \"not a melting pot, but a gorgeous mosaic\". The crime rate in New York City had risen alarmingly during the 1980s, and the rate of homicide in particular reached an all-time high of 2,245 cases during 1990, the first year of the Dinkins administration. The rates of most crimes, including all categories of violent crime, then declined during the remainder of his four-year term. That ended a 30-year upward spiral and initiated a trend of falling rates that continued and accelerated beyond his term. However, the high absolute levels, the peak early in his administration, and the only modest decline subsequently ( down 12% from 1990 to 1993) resulted in Dinkins' suffering politically from the perception that crime remained out of control on his watch. Dinkins in fact initiated a hiring program that expanded the police department nearly 25%. '''' reported, \"He obtained the State Legislature's permission to dedicate a tax to hire thousands of police officers, and he fought to preserve a portion of that anticrime money to keep schools open into the evening, an award-winning initiative that kept tens of thousands of teenagers off the street.\"\n\nDinkins' term was marked by a greater push toward accountability and oversight regarding police misconduct, which led to friction between Dinkins and the city's . In 1992, Dinkins proposed a bill to change the leadership of the  (CCRB), the oversight body that examined complaints of police misconduct, from half-cop–half-civilian to all civilian and make it independent of the New York Police Department. Following the , fueled by the beating of Jose \"Kiko\" Garcia, an undocumented  immigrant, by a police officer, Dinkins attempted to diffuse tensions by inviting Garcia's family to . This gesture outraged the city's PBA, who claimed Dinkins's actions showed favoritism toward Garcia and bias against the police. To condemn Dinkins' position on policing, the city PBA organized a , which quickly turned violent when nearly 4,000 off-duty police officers blocked traffic on the  and knocked over police barricades in an attempt to rush . The nearly 300 uniformed on-duty officers did little to control the riot. Despite the riot and objections from the PBA, the CCRB was reorganized and made independent from the police department in July 1993.\n\n\nDinkins was rebuffed in his attempt to end the .\n\nDuring his final days in office, Dinkins made last-minute negotiations with the sanitation workers, presumably to preserve the public status of garbage removal. Giuliani, who had defeated Dinkins in the 1993 mayoral race, blamed Dinkins for a \"cheap political trick\" when Dinkins planned the resignation of , Dinkins' appointee on the board of education, thus guaranteeing Gotbaum's replacement six months in office.

Nevertheless, Dinkins' mayoralty was marked by a number of significant achievements. New York City's crime rate, including the murder rate, declined in Dinkins' final years in office; Dinkins persuaded the state legislature to dedicate certain tax revenue for crime control (including an increase in the size of the  along with after-school programs for teenagers), and he hired  as police commissioner.  was cleaned up during Dinkins' term, and he persuaded  to rehabilitate the old  on .

Since 2012, city planners had been working to bring residents to forums to consult on the process. The plan was to \"invite developers to build up local streets in exchange for more units of affordable housing.\"\n\nIn January 2019, de Blasio and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development  reached an agreement to change the operations of the New York City Housing Authority.

If you're not sick, you should be going about your life.\"\n\nOn March 16, ''The New York Times'' reported that during the previous week, de Blasio's \"top aides were furiously trying to change the mayor's approach to the coronavirus outbreak. There had been arguments and shouting matches between the mayor and some of his advisers; some top health officials had even threatened to resign if he refused to accept the need to close schools and businesses.\" \nDe Blasio followed their advice.\n\nDe Blasio was criticized for singling out Jewish residents of the city, following tweets directed at \"the Jewish community\", who described de Blasio's actions as . In early June 2020, he was criticized for enforcing restrictions on religious gatherings to no more than 25% of capacity whereas all other groups were allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Catholic priests and Jewish synagogue worshipers then sued both De Blasio and Governor Cuomo for being more than twice as restrictive of worship than protest events. In late June, a federal judge overruled the religious worship restrictions and others that limited New York outdoor gatherings.\n\nWhen  asked De Blasio in a July 2020 radio interview about his approach to helping businesses recover from the pandemic, de Blasio said that his \"focus has not been on the business community and the elite\", and, quoting Karl Marx's , that \"the state is the executive committee of the bourgeoisie.\" He quoted , another communist figure, at a rally in Miami a year earlier, upsetting that city's Latino community.\n\n\nIn 2014, De Blasio's decision to deny public space to several New York City s provoked controversy among advocates of . The decision overturned a Bloomberg administration arrangement that allowed for \"co-locations\", where charter schools were housed in public school buildings. De Blasio also revoked $200 million of capital funding earmarked for charter schools. ''The New York Times'' emphasized that de Blasio approved 14 charter school co-locations and only denied three, suggesting that he was being unfairly cast as being opposed to charter schools. Two months after the initial decision, the mayor's office announced that it had found space for the three schools. The city would lease, renovate, and maintain three buildings, which were previously used for Catholic schools, from the . The three charter schools are run by .\n\n\nIn April 2019, De Blasio announced his support for the  and for legislation to ban the construction of glass and steel skyscrapers in New York City, citing environmental concerns and feeling they contribute to global warming. He also criticized the development at  in Manhattan.\n\n\nOn May 31, 2020, de Blasio issued a statement blaming protesters for being in the way of two police cruisers that pushed a barricade into them. On June 7, 2020, he announced: \"We will be moving funding from the NYPD to youth initiatives and social services.\" De Blasio blamed \"anarchist\" protesters for inciting and organizing violent riots.\n\nOn June 21, 2020, the  announced that it was asking city officials to remove the '''' with a Native American man and an African man standing next to the horse. De Blasio endorsed the decision.\n\n\n in June 2013]]\nOn February 14, 2019, while addressing a rally in New York City about combating , De Blasio said: \"Maybe some people don't realize it, but when they support the  movement, they are affronting the  and that is unacceptable.\" De Blasio condemned Representative 's remarks about Israel and  as \"absolutely unacceptable\" and \"illogical\".\n\n\nIn December 2018, De Blasio announced his support for  in New York City, calling it a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity to get a historic issue right for future New Yorkers.\" He worked with a marijuana task force to produce a report on licensing and regulation, which was released along with a letter of endorsement.\n\n\nIn 2015, de Blasio repealed a public health requirement that s inform parents of the risks of , an oral circumcision ritual that was linked to 17 cases of infant herpes, brain damage, and two deaths since 2000. In 2012, the rule was passed by the city's Board of Health, which required parents to sign a consent form. Some ultra- leaders called the requirement an infringement on religious freedom, sued the city in federal court, and pressed their followers not to comply. After de Blasio installed allies and donors on New York City's Board of Health, a new policy was instated that mohels could be banned for life if they tested positive for herpes and the DNA strain matched the infant's, but only after a child was infected. It was soon revealed that the city was not disclosing new infections as required by the new policy, and children continued to become infected after undergoing the ritual.\n\n\nDe Blasio put his wife, Chirlane McCray, in charge of major policy initiatives such as the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City and ThriveNYC (a $850 million mental health initiative). This caused criticism since McCray had never been elected to office and was chosen for these positions only because of her relationship with De Blasio. De Blasio accused critics of the arrangement of \"sexism\" and bemoaned the city's anti- laws that prevented McCray from receiving a substantial salary.\n\n\n in November 2014|279x279px]]\nDuring his mayoral tenure, de Blasio's relationship with the  was called \"strained\", \"combative\", and \"frosty\".\n\nEnding  was a centerpiece of De Blasio's campaign. The practice had been challenged by civil rights groups in federal court, where it was . The federal appeal of this decision filed by the Bloomberg administration was dropped by de Blasio upon taking office. He vowed to settle cases with claimants who had ongoing litigation against the police for stop and frisk arrests. The NYPD union appealed the decision without de Blasio's support, and was rejected.\n\nDe Blasio selected  for , a position he had held under Mayor . Bratton, who introduced  under Giuliani, promised it would be used \"legally, respectfully\" and less frequently. Some de Blasio supporters were disappointed by Bratton's appointment.\n\nIn February 2014, Pastor Bishop Orlando Findlayterthe founder of the New Hope Christian Fellowship Church, and a friend and supporter of de Blasiowas pulled over for failing to signal before making a left turn. Findlayter was then detained by police on outstanding warrants and driving with a suspended license. De Blasio is alleged to have called the police on Findlayter's behalf. Findlayter was released shortly thereafter. In a press conference, de Blasio told reporters that while he had called the police to make an inquiry regarding Findlayter's arrest he did not ask the police to release him. A spokesperson for the mayor said that de Blasio's call occurred after the police already had decided to release Findlayter. While both the police and City Hall denied that De Blasio requested preferential treatment for Findlayter, City Comptroller  said De Blasio's behavior was concerning because \"the mayor shouldn't be involved in any way about somebody's arrest.\"\n\nOn December 3, 2014, after a  decided not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the , de Blasio said in a speech that he and his  wife, , had had many conversations with their biracial son about taking \"special care in any encounters he has with the police officers who are there to protect him\". De Blasio also \"offered qualified support for protesters after the grand jury decision not to charge the officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City\".\n\nAfter New York City police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed in an ambush in December 2014, \"cops and union leaders publicly rebuked [de Blasio], arguing [that] his earlier remarks had stoked anti-police sentiment.\" When de Blasio eulogized the two fallen officers, hundreds of their fellow police officers turned their backs on him.\n\nAfter the murder of New York City police officer Miosotis Familia in July 2017, de Blasio received further criticism for not attending Familia's vigil. Many officers again turned their backs on him when he spoke at a service for Familia.\n\nIn November 2019, de Blasio criticized former mayor Michael Bloomberg's apology for the  policy, tweeting, \"This is LONG overdue and the timing is transparent and cynical. With all due respect to my predecessor, we've spent six years undoing the damage he created with this bankrupt policy. We ended stop and frisk AND drove down crime. Actions speak louder than words.\" Police Benevolent Association President  joined the Mayor in criticizing Bloomberg's apology as well.\n\n\nOn 10 January 2014, the mayor received light-hearted criticism after a photoshoot where he ate a pizza with a knife and fork at a  pizzeria. In defense, de Blasio claimed that it was traditional in Italy to eat pizza in such a manner. Marc Cosentino, the owner of the pizzeria, later auctioned off the notorious fork for $2,500 to raise money for the . The controversy was variously dubbed \"Forkgate\", \"Pizzagate\", and \"Pizzaghazi\".\n\n\nWhen de Blasio appointed Minerva Tantoco as the city's chief technology officer in fall 2014, he said her goal would be to \"develop and implement a coordinated strategy for technology and innovation, for how this city as a whole is going to approach the role of technology in our everyday lives, in our economy, in our schools, in our civic participation.\" Two years later, Tantoco's efforts were only partially successful.\n\nAlong with Governor Cuomo, de Blasio supported moving 's  to  in the  search, and worked with Cuomo to develop a benefits package from New York City and State funds totaling $2.988 billion. In November 2018, Long Island City in Queens was selected as one of two sites for HQ2, along with  in , outside of  Long Island City's selection as a site for Amazon's HQ2 was controversial before and after it happened, and was protested by local residents, community organizations, and politicians. After receiving pushback, Amazon withdrew its plans to open HQ2 in Long Island City on February 14, 2019. De Blasio criticized Amazon's decision.\n\n\nIn 2014, de Blasio released a report dedicated to \"better transit for New York City.\" Some of the ideas brought up in the report were to rebuild /, create more  routes, and a \"Vision Zero\" initiative to reduce traffic-related deaths in the city.\n\nThe \"Vision Zero\" initiative, inspired by a successful Swedish plan, saw a gradual decrease in pedestrian fatalities, from 299 in 2013 to 200 in 2018. But in 2019 there was an increase in cyclist deaths, and de Blasio discussed several proposals to combat cyclist deaths, including a $58.4 million plan and requiring cyclists to wear helmets and acquire licenses to operate a bicycle.\n\nWhile the de Blasio administration planned on increasing the rate at which bicycle racks were added in the city, the annual rate instead fell by 42% compared to the Bloomberg administration, reaching a new average of 1,633 new racks per year. Jon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said, \"Everybody's talking about s and scooters but it's the humble bike rack that needs more attention.\"\n\n\nAs mayor, de Blasio's signature initiative was the implementation of , i.e. publicly funded pre-kindergarten for all New York City residents. He sought to fund the program by increasing taxes on New York City residents earning $500,000 or more. De Blasio's initiative saw an increase in Universal Pre-K enrollment in New York City through 2015, with over 70% of pre-K expansions happening within the ZIP codes of the city's poorest quartile. In 2017, de Blasio proposed an expansion of the program to \"3-K\", to include three-year-olds. Preschool for three-year-olds would start in poorer neighborhoods, with the goal of covering the entire city, if the state or federal governments provided funding.\n\n\n \n|slogan = Working People First\n|chant =\n|homepage = (archived - August 2, 2019)\n}}\n\nOn May 16, 2019, de Blasio announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for president after releasing a  video in which he said, \"I'm Bill de Blasio, and I'm running for president because it's time we put working people first.\" He was the first incumbent mayor of New York City to run for president since , who ran for the Democratic nomination in .\n\nDuring his campaign, de Blasio expressed support for increasing the federal  to $15 an hour. On June 19, 2019, he said, \"We have to make sure there is a peace settlement in Afghanistan; it obviously has to involve the . Until that point, I don't think it's sensible to take out our troops.\" De Blasio advocated a  and proposed to make large corporations responsible for five years of income tax from jobs that are automated away.\n\nDespite his large margins of victory during his mayoral races, polls found de Blasio to be widely unpopular. ''The New York Times'' described his candidacy as a \"long shot\", citing his low national poll numbers and inconsistent approval ratings in New York City. An April 2019 poll found his approval rating at 42% in the city, with 44% of voters disapproving. A May 2019  of New York City voters found that 76% did not want de Blasio to run for president. Just before he suspended his campaign, his approval rating had dropped to 33%, with 58% disapproving.\n\nDe Blasio attempted to position himself as a progressive in contrast to the at-the-time front-runner, former  . He was hoping to challenge U.S. Senators  of  and  of , both of whom were seen as leaders of the progressive wing of the Democratic party.\n\nDe Blasio's campaign failed to gain traction. He was unable to qualify for  in September and October, which were seen as necessary events for his campaign to maintain viability. He regularly polled at 0% among Democratic primary voters, including in his home state. After failing to qualify for the third round of primary debates, de Blasio announced the suspension of his campaign on September 20, 2019. On February 14, 2020, de Blasio endorsed Sanders. \n\nIn May 2019, de Blasio consulted with New York City's Conflicts of Interest Board (COIB) to ask if he could bill the city for an NYPD security detail while campaigning. The COIB warned de Blasio at the time against billing taxpayers for travel expenses incurred by the security detail. De Blasio ultimately went on 31 out-of-state trips while campaigning, racking up $319,747 in travel costs which he billed to New York City. In October 2021, the New York City Department of Investigations published a report with findings that \"the City has not been reimbursed by the de Blasio Campaign for the travel expenses of the security detail during the Mayor's presidential campaign, totaling over $300,000.\" In June 2023, the COIB ordered de Blasio to repay the $319,747 in security travel costs and fined him an additional $155,000, the largest fine it had ever issued. \n\nIn May 2023, the Federal Election Commission issued a $53,000 fine against de Blasio's campaign for accepting improper contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Blasio and his wife, activist and poet , met while both were working for Mayor ' administration and married in 1994. The couple honeymooned in  in violation of a . They lived in  before they moved to , the traditional residence of New York City mayors. They have two children: Dante, a graduate of  who graduated from  in 2019, and Chiara, a student at  in California. Chiara addressed her  and  in late December 2013, in a four-minute video that de Blasio's mayoral transition team released. In July 2023, de Blasio and McCray announced their separation and that they will start dating other people, though the two would not be seeking a divorce and would continue to share their Park Slope residence.\n\nAt , de Blasio is the tallest mayor in New York City's history.\n\nDe Blasio, an , occasionally gives interviews, press conferences, and speeches in .\n\nDe Blasio is a passionate fan of the , having said he has a \"deep devotion\" to the ' archrivals.\n\n\nDe Blasio has described himself as \"\".

Since then, each new Council Member had been the Chief of Staff of his immediate predecessor. Carr was endorsed by the Staten Island Republican Party.\n\nAs one of five candidates in the primary, Carr made his campaign about public safety by calling for 6,000 new police officers to be hired over the ensuing five fiscal years and the restoration of qualified immunity to  officers. The contest became contentious as Carr accused an opponent, Marko Kepi, of illegal ballot harvesting including the registering of a dead person to vote and of forging signatures to get absentee ballots. This in turn led to recriminations of racism and vote manipulation. After losing a manual recount, Kepi took the matter to court where the presiding judge noted disturbing patterns in the signatures on the absentee envelopes.

He was the first  mayor in the city's history.\n\n\nJohnson is a native of . He earned a B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from  in 1965 and 1967, respectively. He then moved to , where he worked at  and the Flint Urban League. He married Sylvia Andrews McCoy Johnson, Esq., and in 1972 moved to .\n\n\nPrior to his election as mayor, Johnson served for 21 years as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Urban League of Rochester, responsible for developing and overseeing programs and project in education, youth development, family services, employment training, and affordable housing. Under his tenure, the league expanded its expenditures and number of community programs.\n\n\nJohnson first entered politics when he ran for Mayor of Rochester in 1993 as a . In the Democratic primary, he defeated County Legislator Kevin Murray and former City Councilmember Ruth Scott. He received over 72 percent of the vote in the November general election to succeed 20-year incumbent . Johnson was the city's first African-American mayor. In November 1997, Johnson was re-elected without opposition. In November 2001, he was  with over 78 percent of the vote. Johnson announced during that campaign that he would not seek a fourth term.\n\nJohnson faced several challenges as mayor, including a declining population, shrinking tax base, rising demand for social services, and a high violent crime rate. He became known for his willingness to take risks for city improvement. He introduced a number of innovative programs as mayor, including the Neighbors Building Neighborhoods Program to allow citizen involvement in community planning, and the creation of Neighborhood Empowerment Teams and a Community Oriented Policing program to allow citizen input on policing and encourage collaboration between the  and residents. In 1998, the city implemented the Rochester 2010 Plan, a long-term urban planning blueprint based on proposals from residents, and in 2002, the city's zoning code was overhauled. The  was first held in 2002 with Johnson's support. Rochester's fiscal health and credit rating remained strong under his tenure, despite the loss of tax revenue. \n\nOther projects Johnson supported were less successful. Johnson spearheaded the '''' fast ferry service between Rochester and . First approved in 2001, the fast ferry service began in 2004 but was plagued by numerous operational and financial issues, stopping service multiple times, and losing millions of dollars. The ferry's terminal building in , which still stands today, was named after Johnson in 2018, which was seen as an \"insult\" to his legacy by arch-conservative journalist Bob Lonsberry. Despite large amounts of public investment, the city also failed to attract new businesses during his tenure. \n\nIn 1999, Johnson was named the United States' Local Public Official of the Year by ''Governing Magazine''. In 2004, he was a finalist for the World Mayor Prize.\n\nJohnson retired as mayor in 2005 and became a professor at the . Johnson's successor  undid many of the changes he had introduced. The ferry was shut down in 2006, with the city selling the ''Spirit of Ontario'' in 2007. Programs for citizen engagement were shut down, and community policing was replaced with a zero-tolerance policing strategy.\n\n\nIn 2003, Johnson ran unsuccessfully for  Executive on a platform of fiscal responsibility and regional cooperation and innovation. In 2011, after a tumultuous period in which the City of Rochester had three different mayors in three weeks after having only three mayors in the previous thirty-seven years, Johnson ran again for Mayor in a special election to serve the remainder of the term of Robert Duffy, who resigned.

Her final act in office was to submit a proposal for a  pilot program for impoverished families in the city.\n\n\nWarren's  account was temporarily suspended on December 22, 2014, when pictures of a chat log were shared over the internet and social media.\n\n\nFollowing the , in which two of Warren's primary opponents filed separate complaints, the  found evidence that Warren's campaign violated finance and campaigning laws with her , and alleged that the mayor was directly involved. Warren's lawyer denied the allegations.\n\nIn October 2020, Warren was indicted on two felony charges of breaking campaign finance rules. She pled not guilty to both charges. Had the case gone to trial and resulted in a conviction, she faced up to a four-year prison sentence, having her law license revoked, and being removed from office as mayor.\n\nOn October 4, 2021, Warren accepted a plea deal prior to her trial that would downgrade her felony charges to misdemeanors, with two assistants also pleading guilty. As part of the deal, which also resolves charges from an unrelated case, she retained her law license but was forced to resign as mayor, effective on December 1.\n\n\nWarren faced significant backlash after the March 2020  at the hands of Rochester police and her failure to publicly comment on the investigation into it. On March 12, 2021, a probe by the city council determined that Mayor Warren and then-Rochester   concealed critical details about Prude's death from the public and lied about their knowledge of the case.\n\n\nOn May 19, 2021, the  served a warrant at her house in accordance with a seven-month long wiretap investigation related to a “significant” mid-level narcotics ring.  Timothy Granison, Warren’s husband, was arrested, alleged to be a part of the operation.  Seven other homes around the city were raided, and six others were charged.  The raids yielded more than two kilos of crack and powdered cocaine - with a value estimated around $60,000 - several firearms, and over $100,000 in cash.\n\nGranison was arraigned on charges of possession of 31 grams of cocaine with intent to sell, and illegal possession of a handgun. Police say the drugs were found in his car during a traffic stop, and the gun was found in the mayor’s house during the search.  A semi-automatic rifle was also found in the home, with an unknown legal status. Granison pled not guilty and was released on his own recognizance.\n\nMonroe County District Attorney Sandra Doorley said the narcotics investigation is separate from campaign finance fraud investigation of Warren, and that Warren is uninvolved.  Doorley denied any political motivation for the investigation, noting that Granison was not the original target of the wiretap, and that once she was aware of his involvement, “we followed the evidence, as simply as that”. Though Warren was not charged with drug possession, she was later indicted on July 16, 2021, along with Granison for criminal possession of a firearm, two counts of child endangerment, and two counts of failure to lock/secure firearms in a dwelling. Warren's charges in this case were resolved as part of the plea deal involving her campaign finance case.\n\nGranison was previously part of a 1997 armed robbery of a jewelry store, when he was 17.

And he knows that blue lives matter.\" Later in the campaign, Patton joined other campaign spokeswomen on the Trump-Pence Women's Empowerment Tour.\n\nShe was a director of .\n\n\n\nIn January 2017, Patton was appointed a  liaison and Director of Public Liaison for the . Since the Trump Organization co-owns some properties that receive federal rental subsidies from HUD, her position raised questions of conflict of interest.\n\nFrom July 5, 2017, to January 2021, Patton was head of HUD Region II, covering New York and New Jersey. She had no experience with . U.S. Representatives  and , both Democrats from New York, urged the administration to reconsider the appointment.\n\nIn January 2018, Patton apologized after calling , the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for , \"Miss Piggy\".\n\nIn September 2018, Patton commented positively with two emojis on an Instagram post by , the president's son, mocking the sexual assault allegation against  . That same month, Patton made misleading posts on social media suggesting that CNN \"is #FakeNews.\"\n\nPatton's tenure at HUD was marked by s. In November 2018, Patton claimed that she would be moving from her New York apartment in Trump Plaza to  (NYCHA) public housing, saying, \"It was not okay for me to preside over the largest housing crisis in the nation from the warmth and comfort of my own safe and sanitary apartment while NYCHA residents continue to suffer the most inhumane conditions.\" Patton blamed the housing authority for ineptitude and indifference to the conditions \"suffered by hard working residents.\" She began an announced month-long stay in NYCHA housing on February 11, 2019.\n\nPatton also made a \"surprise cameo\" at a hearing of , a former Trump attorney. At the February 2019  hearing, Republican congressman  presented Patton at the hearing, to rebut Cohen's assertion that Trump is a \"racist.\" This prompted a sharp exchange later between Meadows and Rep. , who asserted, \"The fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber in this committee is alone racist in itself.\" After being pressed by Committee Chairman  (D-MD) on what she meant, Tlaib clarified her remarks and apologized to Meadows. Patton also asked about the possibility of starring in a  program; and used the Trump family name in an unsuccessful attempt to have a HUD employee fired.\n\nIn August 2019, she responded to the suicide of accused underage sex trafficker  with an Instagram post that promoted unfounded ; Patton suggested that both men had been .\n\n\nFrom December 2017 and April 2018, Patton used her government Twitter account to \"like\" partisan tweets; in 2019, the  (OSC) determined that these actions violated the , which prohibits employees of the federal executive branch from engaging in certain political activities. In May 2019, when asked about potential Hatch Act violations, Patton said \"I honestly don't care.\" The OSC issued Patton a warning letter in September 2019 for two violations of the Hatch Act; the office issued her a reprimand, but decided not to pursue disciplinary action. The OSC cleared Patton of two other alleged violations.\n\nIn 2020, Patton tricked four New Yorkers into appearing in a video that was broadcast during the final night of the .Haag, Matthew (August 28, 2020). . ''The New York Times''.Haag, Matthew (April 6, 2021). . ''The New York Times''. Patton unexpectedly called the leader of a NYCHA tenants' association, telling them that she was interested in speaking with tenants about poor public housing conditions, and personally interviewed four tenants for four hours. The tenants' comments were edited down to a two-minute video clip that was played at the Republican convention; the video attacked New York City Mayor  and suggested that the tenants were Trump supporters. The tenants, who were never told the true purpose of the interviews, were angered; one of the tenants said she was not a Trump supporter and disapproved \"of his racist policies on immigration.\" Patton denied deceiving the residents. Several watchdog groups, including the  and , filed complaints with OSC over the video. In April 2021, Patton reached a settlement with OSC over violations of the Hatch Act in regard to the incident. She admitted to violating the Hatch Act, agreed to pay a $1,000 fine, and accepted a four-year (48-month) ban from federal employment. The OSC issued a statement saying, \"By using information and NYCHA connections available to her solely by virtue of her HUD position, Patton improperly harnessed the authority of her federal position to assist the Trump campaign in violation of the Hatch Act.\"\n\nAfter the complaint with Patton was filed, the  wrote a letter expressing concerns of bias, given that Patton, a Black woman, was the only Trump administration appointee against whom OSC filed a Hatch Act complaint.\n\n\nPatton is a senior advisor to the  Trump 2024 campaign.\n\n\nPatton says she has struggled with substance abuse and addiction, and publicly praised the Trump family for standing by her through tough times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was first elected in 2009 for a four-year term and was re-elected in 2013 for a second four-year term.\n\n\nMaragos received an  in finance in 1983 from  in . As an undergraduate, he studied  at  in , Canada, earning a  in electrical engineering in 1973.\n\n\nMaragos started his career at  where he was one of the youngest managers in the global technology organization. In 1978, he joined  in New York to work on  Defense Command and Control Systems, requiring security clearances from the . He later became an associate in charge of developing information technology solutions for major multi-national commercial clients.\n\nIn 1981, he joined , leading a team charged with building the organization's international data and money transfer network. He was later promoted to vice president. In 1986, he joined  as vice president and director of North American Treasury and Telecommunications Systems.\n\nIn 1989, Maragos founded his own business, SDS Financial Technologies, and was its president and CEO for over 20 years until his election as Nassau County Comptroller in 2009.\n\n\nMaragos was elected as Nassau County comptroller in November 2009, and was sworn in in January 2010. He was re-elected to a second term beginning in January 2014. The comptroller and his staff oversee the county's budget and financial operations; in 2017, the annual budget was $2.6 billion. The comptroller's office audits government agencies, reviews all county contracts and claims and reports on all matters that significantly affect Nassau County's financial health and operations. The office is also in charge of administering the county payroll and employee health benefits, and preparing Nassau County's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. In general, Maragos and his staff \"work with the administration and legislature to help Nassau County overcome its fiscal challenges\".\n\n\nMaragos released an audit of the Nassau County Police Department which revealed $96.28 million in higher-than-budgeted overtime costs and $382.27 million in savings from attrition from 2009 to 2014. These figures were compounded on $247.58 million in estimated future savings as a result of the new collective bargaining agreement. Maragos gave credit to the Nassau County Police for keeping crime low and protecting Nassau County residents but also proposed that the police department's management practices needed to be revised so that more resources could be directed to improve public safety.\n\n\nMaragos released a study in 2014 into the changing demographics of Nassau County. The study proposed a new economic vision for the county which, if implemented, it was claimed would revitalize the economy by drawing on the county's natural advantages to become the health and wellness center of the world. Maragos proposed that Nassau County should become a place where people would \"want to come to receive the best medical treatments and where the next generation of miracle medicines would be discovered\". He urged greater focused investments in innovation, research and development, transportation infrastructure and IT to achieve this economic vision.\n\n\nAt the request of the Nassau County Police Department, the Nassau County Comptroller's Office conducted an audit which revealed that Verizon underpaid the county over $466,919, an amount that may have increased as investigations continued. From 2001 to 2014, Verizon implemented an Enhanced 911 system throughout Nassau County. During this time, Verizon deducted 1-3% beyond the permitted administrative fee from residents' monthly phone bills. The comptroller's office recommended a collaboration with the offices of the Nassau County Police to obtain the total unpaid amount from Verizon while the police department reviewed the previous months that Verizon was working with Nassau County on the E911 system to determine whether or not there was even more withheld during that time.\n\n\nIn a letter dated December 4, 2014, the Hempstead Industrial Development Agency (\"IDA\") proposed a Payment In Lieu Of Taxes (\"PILOT\") which was described to assist with the purchase of 71.87 acres of land and improvements to the Green Acres Commons (formerly known as the Green Acres Mall). It was not until December 12, 2014, that a cost-benefit analysis for the project was released. The approval of the IDA's PILOT on December 17, 2014, directly contributed to a rise in school property taxes from 4.6% to 12.2% while reducing the taxes paid by the Green Acre Commons by $2.7 million. Maragos review of the documents concerned the PILOTs' unusually expedited process of approval, as well as the PILOT's four-page cost-benefit analysis which contained only calculation tables without any explanations. On October 24, 2016, the Nassau County Comptroller's Office commenced a formal audit of the Town of Hempstead IDA regarding the PILOT granted to the Green Acres Mall.\n\n\nMaragos conducted and released an audit of a county contract totaling $385,478 in order to monitor the removal of debris caused by . The contract was performed by Gibbons, Esposito and Boyce (GEB), an engineering firm based in Uniondale, New York. Eight field monitors, who constituted 50% of the employees who were working on the debris removal monitoring project, were underpaid. According to the audit, GEB failed to provide proof that all of its field monitors had the proper FEMA protocol training which was a minimum requirement stated in the contract. Paid time off was not awarded, which is contrary to Living Wave Law. Various time sheets that GEB submitted to the county for reimbursement did not contain the appropriate signatures for approval. GEB and its legal counsel maintained that they were exempt from the county's Living Wage Law. The auditors disagreed. GEB offered to pay the employees the Living Wave underpayment. The audit was sent to Nassau's County and District Attorneys for further review.\n\n\n testimony on the privatization of Island Bus in November 2010]]\nMaragos released a study concerning the proposed privatization of Long Island Bus after over 35 years. The report recommended that the best option for Nassau County was to negotiate with the MTA to continue with the current service, with a more equitable subsidy. The MTA should first decrease the LIBS operating expense by about 4%, so that no increase in subsidies would be required for 2011 by either the MTA or the county. If an increase was necessary, then both the county and the MTA should proportionately increase their subsidies in order to keep the LIBS running. However, if negotiations failed and Nassau County was forced to contribute the full subsidy demanded by the MTA of over $36 million for 2011, then Maragos ultimately recommended that privatization should be pursued.\n\n\nIn early 2011, Maragos released an audit of the Nassau County Traffic and Parking Violations Agency, which showed that on December 31, 2010, the agency had $44 million in uncollected traffic violation fines dating back ten years and $26 million in uncollected parking violations in the previous six years with red light camera passed due tickets estimated at over $10 million alone on December 31, 2011.\n\n\nMaragos released an audit of the Nassau County Office of Consumer Affairs. The audit, conducted from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, revealed that poor internal controls led to a loss of $2.9 million in county revenue. Missed violations from a lack of Item Pricing Waiver inspections resulted in approximately $1.5 million in uncollected fees. Maragos went on to say that a complete overhaul was needed to restore the confidence of the public and to improve efficiency.\n\n\nIn January 2014, Maragos posted all vendor names, contract amounts and brief summaries of public contracts to social media via ''Facebook''. This is considered to be the first time nationwide that public contracts had been released to the public in such a manner.\n\n\nIn 2010, Maragos and his staff were awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting from the  of the United States and Canada, for the county's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The Comptroller's office was similarly recognized by the professional association in the next five years (2011-2015).\n\nOther honors and awards include:\n* Sergeant-at-Arms of the  Republican Club\n* Public Service Award of the Hempstead Coordinating Council of Civic Associations, October 2013\n* Hispanic Heritage Community Service Leadership Award, of the Theodore Roosevelt Council, Boy Scouts of America, October 2013\n* Superstorm Sandy Leadership Award of the Long Island Contractors' Association (LICA), 2012\n\n\nMaragos announced on September 29, 2016, that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Nassau County Executive in 2017. He stated that he had been at odds with County Republican leaders \"for years\" but, up until May 2016, he had still been donating heavily to Republicans and the County Republican Committee.\n\nHe was criticised by both Republicans and Democrats after his switch of party affiliation to run for County Executive. Brian Nevin, the spokesman for Republican , called him an opportunist with Conservative values that he trumpeted during his two failed Senate campaigns. Robert Zimmerman, the Democratic National Committeeman from , called Maragos's switch \"an affront to the principles and standards of the Democratic Party\".\n\n\n\n\nMaragos faced Congressman  and attorney  in a primary election to face  Senator . The 2012 New York State Republican Convention split the endorsement between the three candidates, with enough support for each candidate to automatically appear on the ballot. The primary was held on June 26, 2012, and the general election coincided with the presidential election on November 2.\n\t\nMaragos was unable to win name recognition outside Nassau County and ultimately was defeated and came in last place.\n\nMaragos also attempted to run for the US Senate in 2010.\n\n\nMaragos said during an interview, \"Some people would even like to marry with their pets,\" worried that the legalization of gay marriage could also lead to the legalization of polygamy. At the time, he was against abortion, except to preserve the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. Maragos later explained that his views had \"evolved\", believing in the right of a woman to choose and that same-sex marriage is the law and should be respected.\n\n\nMaragos has been married to Angela since 1973, and has two sons, Peter and Angelo, and two grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Conservative line received 232,281 votes (15.0% of Paladino's total, and 5.0% of the statewide total) and the Taxpayers line received 25,821 votes (1.5% and 0.6%), with the Republican line receiving the remaining 1,290,082 votes (83.3% and 27.1%).\n\n\n\nCuomo sought reelection in 2014, with former U.S. Representative Kathy Hochul as his new running mate. On March&nbsp;5, 2014,    announced that he would run on the Republican ticket against Cuomo for governor. Law professors  and  challenged the Cuomo–Hochul ticket in the Democratic primary electioncapturing 34% of the vote on the gubernatorial line (Wu drew 40.1% as lieutenant governor). On November 4, 2014, Cuomo was reelected for a second term with 54% of the vote, while Astorino received 40.6% of the vote.\n\nDespite low voter turnout, Cuomo won the general election by a comfortable margin; however, his margin of victory was smaller than it had been in his 2010 victory. Astorino won most of upstate New York but was overwhelmed in New York City. Cuomo was sworn in for his second term as governor.\n\n\n\nCuomo was challenged in the primary from the left by actress and activist . She criticized him for having failed to fix the  following his declaration of the  as well as for not protecting undocumented immigrants, not legalizing recreational marijuana, and not creating a single-payer healthcare system. When debating Nixon, Cuomo countered her argument on the subways by pointing out that the system is owned by New York City, though past administrations agree it is the governor's role. An analysis conducted by New York City comptroller Scott Stringer revealed that New York City pays for 70 percent of subway repair costs.\n\nCuomo defeated Nixon, 65.5–34.5%.\n\nOn November 6, 2018, the Cuomo-Hochul ticket defeated the Molinaro-Killian ticket by a margin of 59.6% to 36.2%.\n\nOn March 19, 2021, '''', in an episode of their podcast '''', leaked audio of Cuomo threatening Bill Lipton, head of the , which had endorsed primary opponent Nixon, that \"[i]f you ever say, 'Well he's better than a Republican' again, then I'm gonna say, 'You're better than a child rapist.'\"\n\n\n\nIn May 2019, Governor Cuomo announced he would run for a fourth term. In August 2021, after a report released by the , , detailed accusations of sexual harassment by Governor Cuomo and his attempts to silence victims, the 's leaders indicated that they would seek to remove Cuomo from office. While denouncing the report's findings as political and maintaining his\ninnocence, in the face of almost certain removal from office, he announced his resignation as Governor, effective August 24, 2021. Although there was no formal withdrawal, individuals close to Cuomo indicated he would likely not seek his party's nomination following his resignation.\n\n\n\nCuomo took the gubernatorial  at 12:01&nbsp;a.m. on January 1, 2011, succeeding David Paterson. During his first year as governor, Cuomo worked to pass an on-time budget that cut spending without raising taxes, made a new deal with a large state-employee union, signed ethics reform legislation, passed a property tax cap, worked to enact a same-sex marriage bill with bipartisan support, and restructured New York's tax code.\n\nIn 2014, '''' reported that Cuomo had been actively involved in the formation of the  (IDC) three years earlier, which gave control of the state senate to Republicans. He has been accused of failing to bridge the rift between the IDC and the Democratic caucus in the Senate.\n\n (center left) in 2012]]\nThere was media speculation about a possible presidential run, either in 2016 or 2020. Several reports indicated that Cuomo supported the  until its dissolution and defeat in 2018 in part to appear more moderate for an eventual presidential bid. Cuomo denied these allegations, and in 2018 was responsible for reuniting the IDC with the mainstream Democratic conference.\n\nFor his 2018 re-election bid, Cuomo accepted being on top of the ballot line for the Independence Party, a list that featured numerous Republicans, including ardent Trump supporters.\n\nIn an August 15, 2018, anti-sex trafficking bill-signing event, Cuomo said: \"We're not gonna make America great again. It was never that great. We have not reached greatness. We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.\" The assembled audience of Cuomo's supporters booed.\n\nIn a February 2019 , Cuomo's approval rating dropped to 43 percent, the lowest of his tenure as governor, and a full 50% said they disapproved. The poll showed an eight-percent drop from January 2019; it was taken after Cuomo signed several pieces of progressive legislation, including an  and stricter gun laws, suggesting that the legislation may have upset certain voters and contributed to the drop; however, the majority of voters agreed with his position on both issues. By early 2020, Cuomo's favorability rating was up to 77 percent, a record high.\n\n\nOn his first day in office, Cuomo renewed an executive order signed by  which prohibited Governors of New York from receiving donations from gubernatorial appointees. A February 2018 investigation by ''The New York Times'', however, revealed that the Cuomo administration had quietly reinterpreted the order, and that Cuomo had collected $890,000 from 24 of his appointees, as well as $1.3 million from the spouses, children and businesses of appointees. Some donations were made to Cuomo just days after the donor was appointed.\n\nIn March 2018, ''The New York Times'' reported that Cuomo had rewritten the disclaimer language on his campaign website for the executive order barring donations from appointees. The website added two caveats whereby some gubernatorial appointees are allowed to donate to the governor, which ''The Times'' said could potentially lead to more donations from appointees to the governor. The Cuomo campaign returned a $2,500 donation from one appointee who was in violation of the new disclaimer, but retained approximately $890,000 raised from other appointees.\n\nFrom the time of  governor 's retirement on January 4, 2021, until his resignation on August 23, 2021, Cuomo was the longest-serving governor in the United States still in position, with 3,887 days in office.\n\n\nCuomo has supported providing tax and other incentives to attract business to locate in New York State.  He even joked in 2018 that he would be willing to change his name to \"Amazon Cuomo\" if  located their \"\" in the state. His strong support for New York City's bid to become the home of Amazon's HQ2 faced criticism based on arguments that the costs to the state outweighed the possible benefits. Amazon decided on two \"major corporate outposts\", in New York City and , instead of a single second headquarters, before bowing out of the former under local pressure.\n\n\n\n ,  , and a bipartisan group of governors and mayors in 2021]]\nOn March 1, 2020, Cuomo issued a statement regarding  in New York wherein he mentioned the first positive case of novel coronavirus in New York State. On March 2, 2020, Cuomo said that  of the new coronavirus is \"inevitable\". He also mentioned New York City's plans to aggressively ramp up diagnostic testing for the new virus and said that he would like to see New York City conducting \"1,000 tests per day\". He announced the \"world-renowned\"  was partnering with hospitals to expand surge testing capacity to \"1,000 tests per day statewide\" for the novel coronavirus. On March 3, 2020, Cuomo signed a $40 million emergency management authorization for coronavirus response and claimed that \"New York's overall risk remained low\". He also announced the institution of a new cleaning protocol at schools and in the public transportation system \"to help stop any potential spread of the virus\". On March 4, 2020, Cuomo confirmed nine new cases in the state and said that it was \"literally like trying to stop air\" and that it was inevitable that it would continue to spread.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, Cuomo criticized the federal government's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, calling it \"absurd and nonsensical\".\n\nEarly in the coronavirus response efforts, Cuomo received widespread praise from s for his handling of the evolving  in New York State, including a statewide  and a shutdown of nonessential businesses in an effort to help  of the virus. At the same time, however, Cuomo also received criticism for failing to grasp the gravity of the  before its risks were fully visible to the American public.\n\nOn March 28, 2020, Cuomo threatened  with a lawsuit over a state quarantine policy enforcing  on arriving New Yorkers.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, social media posters and television hosts such as , , and  came up with the term \"Cuomosexuals\" to express admiration and love for the governor and his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, related to their  roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn June 2021, Cuomo lifted COVID-19 restrictions, following the news that 70% of adults had one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBetween July and August 2020, it was alleged that Cuomo utilized state resources and property, including assigning work by Executive Chamber government staffers to compile materials and perform frequent work on the drafting of his book on a non-voluntary basis. In October 2020, Cuomo published his book, ''American Crisis'', proclaiming victory against the pandemic due to his leadership. He wrote that New York \"confronted and defeated\" the virus, although the state had the highest per capita hospitalization rate in the country by February 2021. Cuomo was paid more than $5 million to write the book.\n\nIn November 2020, Cuomo received the  from the  for his coronavirus briefings. On August 24, 2021, the morning after his departure, the academy rescinded the Emmy award due to the New York Attorney General's report on sexual harassment allegations against him.\n\nOn December 14, 2021, Cuomo was ordered by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics to pay New York state $5.1 million in book profits he made during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission reversed the prior approval after complaints that Cuomo used state resources, including personnel used to edit, write, prepare, and gather data to write \"American Crisis\". Cuomo was ordered to return proceeds from the book by January 13, 2022. Cuomo denied these claims and sued the joint commission on public ethics alleging they acted improperly. In August 2022 the state appellate court upheld a lower court decision finding that New York's current ethics watchdog commission was unconstitutional. Cuomo won the lawsuit and was permitted to keep the proceeds from the sale of the book.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in his state, nine state health officials resigned, reportedly in response to Cuomo's policies. In a press conference on January 29, 2021, Cuomo stated that he did not trust the expertise of health officials.\n\n\nIn August 2017, the Cuomo administration awarded more than $7 million, financed with money from large bank settlements, in grants to New York colleges to offer courses to New York prisoners. In January 2018, Cuomo proposed reforms that would \"reduce delays during trials, ban asset seizures in cases where there has been no conviction and make it easier for former convicts to get a job after leaving prison\". He also called for an end to cash bail for minor crimes.\n\nUnder Cuomo's tenure, he granted commutations to fewer prisoners than many previous Republican and Democratic New York governors. Cuomo commuted a total of nine sentences. Cuomo pardoned 140 adults who were convicted of nonviolent felonies as 16- and 17-year-olds, but had served their sentences. He pardoned 18 others who had served their sentences for nonviolent felonies but were exposed to deportation due to their criminal record.\n\n rally]]\n\n\nIn 2017, Cuomo announced that the , which produced one quarter of New York City's power, would be phased out. As a result of the phaseout, the carbon-free power generated by the plant was replaced by power generated by carbon-generating . As a consequence, New York was estimated to struggle to meet its climate goals.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2013, Cuomo signed into law the first state  bill to pass after the December&nbsp;14, 2012,  in neighboring Connecticut. The  was described as the toughest gun control law in the United States. The act came under criticism, and the  called it draconian. The New York State Sheriffs' Association issued a statement supporting tougher penalties for illegal use of firearms but criticizing several aspects of the legislation, including a magazine limit of seven rounds and a \"too broad\" definition of assault weapons.\n\nOn July 5, 2013, Cuomo signed an amendment to the NY SAFE Act that exempts retired police officers from some of the act's ownership restrictions.\n\nOn April 2, 2018, Cuomo announced the passage of new legislation that prevents those who have been convicted of domestic violence from possessing any kind of firearms as well as losing their gun license.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, Cuomo signed the \"\" gun protection law, allowing a court to temporarily prohibit someone from buying or possessing a gun if they are deemed a threat to themselves or others.\n\nOn July 30, 2019, Cuomo signed two laws banning the manufacture and sale of  and the other requiring safe storage of firearms when children younger than 16 years of age live in a gun owner's home.\n\nOn July 7, 2021, Cuomo declared the first 'disaster emergency' in the  on gun crime for .\n\nCuomo also resisted repeated efforts by the Legislature to decriminalize the so-called \",\" which had resulted in many arrests of individuals (disproportionately African-American and/or Hispanic) who used these folding knives for work, but not as weapons. Cuomo vetoed the first two attempts by the Legislature to decriminalize folding knives that could be opened with one hand by a \"wrist-flick,\" but, on May 30, 2019, signed into law a repeal of the Penal Code provision that had listed the \"gravity knife\" as a prohibited weapon. Cuomo's memorandum on signing the repeal bill noted: \"As I review this bill for a third time, the legal landscape has changed. In March of this year, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York declared the State's existing 'gravity knife' ban unconstitutional. As argued by many who have advocated for this change in law, the court reasoned that the existing law could result in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\" This was a reference to the case of ''Cracco v. Vance'',  a case decided by Judge  some two months earlier.\n\n\n]]\nAfter  in October 2012, Cuomo allowed New York voters, via a specific provision aimed at accommodating those displaced, to cast provisional ballots for the 2012 election anywhere in the state. He also appointed a  to examine the responses of New York utilities to damage caused by the storm.\n\nControversy ensued when the Cuomo administration used $140 million, including $40 million of federal disaster relief funds, to pay for the broadcast of national TV ads promoting \"New New York\" slogans outside New York in an attempt to attract new business investment to the state. Many have been critical of the effort, including former New York governor , who called the ads \"fluff\" and \"a waste of taxpayer money\".\n\n\n\nIn June 2012, the Cuomo administration said it was considering lifting a state ban on the practice of  (also known as \"fracking\") to stimulate the economy in . But critics said that fracking upstate could contaminate the water supply of New York City, New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania. Following a long-awaited study started years earlier, New York State health officials cited \"significant public health risks\" associated with fracking, and on December 17, 2014, the Cuomo administration announced a ban on hydraulic fracturing in New York State.\n\n\nIn solidarity with , Cuomo announced an executive order against the  movement. Cuomo tweeted: \"If you boycott Israel, New York State will boycott you.\"\n\n\nIn January 2014, Cuomo announced an executive order to allow the limited use of medical marijuana in New York. Later that year, a comprehensive bill to  was passed by the state legislature, containing some restrictions at Cuomo's insistence such as a ban on consumption by smoking. On July 5, 2014, the Compassionate Care Act was signed into law by Governor Cuomo.\n\nIn December 2018, Cuomo announced his support for , after previously stating his opposition and calling it a \"\" as recently as February 2017. On March 31, 2021, recreational use of cannabis was officially legalized with the signing into law of the  by Governor Cuomo.\n\n\n\n on December 31, 2016]]\nIn June 2017, after a series of subway disasters, Cuomo declared a \"state of emergency\" for the  system. According to ''The New York Times'', a series of New York City mayors and New York governors, including Cuomo, were partly at fault for the worsening quality of the subway system and inflated construction costs. Under the Cuomo administration, the  repeatedly diverted tax revenues earmarked for the subways, paid for services that there was no need for and spent on subway projects that did not boost service or reliability. As a result, the MTA was saddled with debt and could not undertake investments into overhauling outdated and inefficient subway infrastructure. Cuomo also directed the MTA to spend on projects that the heads of the MTA did not consider to be priorities. One reason why the New York City subway system is so expensive is due to exorbitant labor costs; according to several M.T.A. officials who were involved in negotiating labor contracts, Cuomo pressured the MTA to accept labor union contracts that were extremely favorable to workers. ''The New York Times'' noted that Cuomo was closely aligned with the union in question and had received $165,000 in campaign contributions from it.\n\n''The New York Times'' reported, \"Cuomo had steered clear of the M.T.A. during his first years in office, but in his second term he took an intense interest. He placed aides within the organization and, in an unusual move, made some report directly to him. He badgered transit leaders about the construction of the  on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And over the objections of some board members, he canceled several M.T.A. capital projects to make room for his own priorities. According to high-ranking current and former M.T.A. officials, the moves interfered with the authority's plans to address the rising delays.\"\n\n\nOn April 18, 2017, Cuomo signed the New York State 2018 fiscal year budget. It included the , a provision that families making less than $125,000 in 2019 could have free tuition at all  and  universities, though some education experts including &nbsp;say it won't help the poorest students and that the requirement that recipients live and work in New York after graduating is counter-productive.\n\n\nOn July 16, 2011, Cuomo finalized a five-year deal with the Public Employees Federation to end pay raises, implement  days, and require additional contributions to health insurance accounts. In an interview with '''', he stated his top goal in 2012 is the reduction of .\n\n\nIn the winter of 2018, Cuomo responded to a class-action lawsuit brought against the  by attorney  on behalf of a group of public housing tenants. The suit was the first of its kind and called upon NYCHA to immediately address decrepit and unhealthy conditions in public housing units across New York City. By early April, Cuomo appointed an independent monitor to oversee NYCHA on an emergency basis.\n\n\nIn a January 17, 2014, interview with Susan Arbetter on 's ''The Capital Pressroom'', Cuomo stated:\n\nit was voted for by moderate Republicans who run the Senate! Their problem is not me and the Democrats; their problem is themselves. Who are they? Are they these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that's who they are and they're the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that's not who New Yorkers are. If they're moderate Republicans like in the Senate right now, who control the Senatemoderate Republicans have a place in their state. George Pataki was governor of this state as a moderate Republican, but not what you're hearing from them on the far right.}}\n\nThis remark received a major reaction in the conservative media. Radio host  wrote a letter to the governor regarding the remarks from the interview.  contributor and radio/TV show host  threatened to move out of the state with all of his assets if Cuomo did not apologize for his remarks. Cardinal , the , said during a radio broadcast that Cuomo's remarks were \"most unfortunate at best. Are there pro-lifers who are extremist? Yes, there are. But I think they are a distinct minority.\"\n\nThe , which is headed by Cuomo, supported his remarks and reiterated them in a May 2014 statement responding to a speech by , who was running against him in the : \" Republicans have done enough damage in Washington, today's speech made it abundantly clear that we don't need them here in New York.\"\n\n\n in 2013]]\nIn keeping with a campaign promise, Cuomo signed the ''Marriage Equality Act'', introducing same-sex marriage, on June 24, 2011, following an \"intense public and private lobbying campaign\", and later called for all states to do the same. Cuomo was lauded for his efforts to pass same-sex marriage legislation. One prominent advocate stated that for gay Americans, Cuomo was \"the only national politician with hero status\". Following the passage of the Act, Cuomo was criticized for describing the viewpoints of opponents as \"anti-American\". On July 25, 2011, a lawsuit was filed in the  seeking an injunction against the Act, alleging corruption and violations of the law in the process of passing the bill. The trial court initially held that the plaintiffs' case could proceed, but the decision was reversed on appeal.\n\nCuomo ordered a boycott of  and  to protest their .\n\n\nIn July 2016, the , a state agency, released a report indicating that the state's flagship business tax incentive program, called Start-Up NY, had generated 408 jobs since its inception in 2014. Ads promoting the program had cost at least $53 million. The Start-Up NY annual report was delayed three months in 2016, leading some lawmakers, such as Assemblyman Schimminger, to call the delays \"curious\".\n\n\n\nCuomo was praised for his 2011 restructuring of the New York State tax code. He was also criticized for allegedly requesting a unanimous Assembly vote in favor of the proposal and threatening to campaign against Assembly members who voted \"no\" – a charge he denied. Cuomo also received criticism from voices on the left who felt that the tax reform was insufficient. Hoping that the Federal cap on state and local tax deductions will be repealed, Cuomo signed a tax increase on high income workers and corporations and the wealthy worth over one million dollars in 2021.  The increase extends until the year 2027.\n\n\nIn April 2018, Cuomo announced that he would restore the voting rights of s through an executive order. He said that he would consider restoring the voting rights of all parolees (more than 35,000), and would also enfranchise new parolees throughout his term.\n\n\nIn 2013, Cuomo called for the passage of a Women's Equality Act. The Women's Equality Act included 10 component bills affecting issues such as domestic violence, human trafficking, and pregnancy discrimination. The tenth bill of the Women's Equality Act was the Reproductive Health Act, which would have \"enshrine[d] in state law existing federal protections for abortion rights\", \"shift[ed] the state's abortion law from the criminal code to the health care laws\", and \"[made] it clearer that licensed health care practitioners as well as physicians could perform abortions\". During his 2013 State of the State address, Cuomo said, \"Enact a Reproductive Health Act because it is her body, it is her choice. Because it's her body, it's her choice. Because it's her body, it's her choice.\" The New York State Assembly passed the Women's Equality Act on June 20, 2013. The Republican leadership of the New York State Senate expressed support for the nine non-abortion-related planks of the Women's Equality Act, but objected to the Reproductive Health Act and expressed unwillingness to allow a vote on it.\n\nOn the final day of the 2013 legislative session, following the Senate Republican Conference's continued refusal to vote on the full Women's Equality Act, Senator Jeff Klein, leader of the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), offered the abortion plank of the Act as a hostile amendment to another bill. The amendment was defeated by a narrow margin of 32–31; all 30 Senate Republicans voted against the abortion amendment, as did Democratic Sens. Ruben Diaz and Simcha Felder. The Senate proceeded to pass the nine non-abortion-related planks of the Women's Equality Act as separate bills, and the 2013 legislative session came to an end without any portion of the WEA becoming law.\n\n\"[After] the 2014 election season was over, with Cuomo victorious, the governor and his lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul both declared the abortion plank of the act officially dormant, if not dead.\" In 2015, the non-abortion-related Women's Equality Act bills passed both houses of the State Legislature. In October 2015, Cuomo signed eight of the 10 Women's Equality Act bills into law; the abortion rights bill was not among them.\n\nOn January 22, 2019, Cuomo signed the 2019 version of the , which passed days after Democrats took control of the state Senate. Cuomo ordered  and other landmarks to be lit in pink to celebrate the bill's passage. Cuomo's signing and the lighting of the World Trade Center building sparked intense criticism from conservatives. The Catholic  criticized Cuomo over the Reproductive Health Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2014, it was reported that the , a committee established by Cuomo to root out corruption in politics,}} was directed away from investigations that could be politically damaging. Cuomo later disbanded the commission. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched an inquiry into Cuomo's dealings with the anti-corruption panel and concluded that \"after a thorough investigation\", there was \"insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime\".\n\nIn September 2016, Joseph Percoco, a close friend and former top aide to Cuomo, was indicted as part of a bribery investigation into the . He had worked for Cuomo in both Washington and Albany and had managed his 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial campaigns. Todd Howe, a lobbyist and former Cuomo aide, was also indicted, along with several developers who were major donors to Cuomo and other state politicians. Cuomo was not accused of wrongdoing.\n\nIn March 2018, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Percoco on felony charges of solicitation of bribes and  for over $315,000 in bribes he took from two people seeking official favors on behalf of an energy company, Competitive Power Ventures Inc. Following Percoco's conviction, Cuomo released a statement declaring that he would respect the jury's verdict and that \"there is no tolerance for any violation of the public trust\". In September 2018, Judge  sentenced Percoco to 6 years in prison. In May 2023, the  unanimously overturned his bribery conviction.\n\nIn March 2021, allegations came out that Cuomo prioritized COVID-19 tests for his family and other associates during the early stages of the pandemic when tests were limited. Particular scrutiny went to the positive test of his brother Chris in March 2020 amid other conflicts of interest that commentators saw in their relationship. These reports were investigated during his impeachment probe but were not included in the final impeachment report.\n\n\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the  issued an advisory requiring the admission of patients to nursing homes who test positive for the coronavirus and barred testing prospective nursing home patients after the  announced that \"patients with COVID-19 could be discharged from a health care facility to both home and long-term care facilities when indicated.\" This was also in federal compliance with the 's announcement that \"Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.\" Due to widespread misinformation in the press, Cuomo and his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, were wrongfully accused of being the origin of mandating nursing homes to accept patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from hospitals.\n\nOn May 10, Cuomo announced that New York would no longer require nursing homes to take COVID-19 patients from hospitals, stating that the change was not a policy reversal, but that hospitals would now be responsible for testing patients before they were released to nursing facilities. By then, as many as 4,500 COVID-19 infected patients had been sent to nursing homes in NY state which was said to have contributed to over 6,000 New York state nursing home residents dying of COVID-19 as of June 2020. However, in July 2020, the New York State Department of Health released a report that found: \"Peak nursing home admissions occurred a week after peak nursing home mortality, therefore illustrating that nursing home admissions from hospitals were not a driver of nursing home infections or fatalities\"; instead the department concluded that asymptomatic nursing home staff drove the infections. Cuomo reacted to this report by stating that attribution of nursing home deaths to his March 2020 policy had \"no basis in fact\".\n\nOn January 28, 2021, an investigation conducted by state attorney general  concluded that the Cuomo administration undercounted COVID-19-related deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50%. James also reported that many nursing home residents died from COVID-19 in hospitals after being transferred from their nursing homes, which was not reflected in the DOH's published total nursing home death data.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Cuomo, said in a call with state  leaders that the Cuomo administration delayed the release of data pertaining to COVID-19 deaths from nursing home patients who died in hospitals while responding to an inquiry that former President  had directed the  to consider investigating. Critics voiced concerns about the probe being politically motivated as New York and three other democratic-led states were targeted by Trump, regarding the same matter. Calls to rescind Cuomo's emergency powers, granted amidst the pandemic, were launched within the  immediately following this report, with 14 Democrats joining the Republican minority in the effort.  \n \nOn February 17, 2021, the  (FBI) and the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn announced they were investigating the incident. On July 23, 2021, the  announced that they would not pursue an investigation into Cuomo's handling of -related deaths in state nursing homes, nor a possible cover up of nursing home deaths, as a result of no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nOn March 19, 2021, the FBI reported that an investigation was underway on Governor Andrew Cuomo for improperly using the power of his office to shield nursing home executive political donors from COVID-19 lawsuits but declined to investigate further.\n\n\n\n\nOn December 13, 2020, , a former aide for Cuomo who was a Democratic candidate for  in 2021, alleged \"[Cuomo] sexually harassed me for years. Many saw it, and watched.\" Boylan further alleged that Cuomo \"exists without ethics\", \"takes advantage of people, including me\" and ran a \"toxic team environment\". A spokesperson for the Cuomo administration denied the accusation. Boylan further elaborated on her accusations in February 2021, claiming Cuomo goaded her to play  with him while on a flight in 2017 and forcibly kissed her on the mouth in his Manhattan office. The governor's office said Boylan's claims were false.\n\nOn February 27, 2021, Charlotte Bennett, an executive assistant and health policy advisor of Cuomo, also accused him of sexual harassment, saying that he asked her about her sex life on several occasions in late Spring 2020 and if she had been in . She also suggested that Cuomo was open to relationships with women \"above the age of 22\". In a statement on February 27, Cuomo denied making advances to Bennett and acting inappropriately towards her.\n\nIn a February 28 statement, Cuomo said: \"I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I never intended.\" He apologized and acknowledged \"some of the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation.\" He also said, \"At work sometimes I think I am being playful and make jokes that I think are funny. I mean no offense and only attempt to add some levity and banter to what is a very serious business.\"\n\nThe two U.S. senators for New York,  and , both Democrats, called for an independent investigation.  press secretary  said in a  interview that President  supported an independent investigation into Governor Cuomo's conduct.\n\nOn March 1, a third woman came forward alleging Cuomo had sexually harassed her and touched her without consent on her bare lower back while posing for a photograph. Anna Ruch was not on the governor's staff, but encountered him socially at a wedding reception in September 2019. The attorney general of New York state, Letitia James, was reported to be investigating options for an independent investigation. When reporting the allegation, ''The New York Times'' also published a photograph from the event which showed Cuomo putting his hands on Ruch's face. She said the incident made her feel \"uncomfortable and embarrassed\".\n\nA fourth woman, Ana Liss, came forward on March 6 and alleged Cuomo touched her inappropriately on her lower back and kissed her hand. That same day, Karen Hinton, a former consultant of Cuomo when he was leading the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleged that in 2000 he had asked personal questions and inappropriately hugged her in his hotel room.\n\nOn March 1, 2021, Cuomo's senior counsel and special adviser Beth Garvey instructed   to proceed with an independent investigation of Cuomo. On March 8, James hired attorneys from two  (firstly Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, and secondly Vladeck, Raskin & Clark) to conduct an independent investigation of Cuomo.\n\nOn March 9, a sixth woman alleged that Cuomo inappropriately touched her at the governor's mansion. On April 7, the unnamed aide said that after she had been summoned to governor's mansion in November 2020, Cuomo allegedly rose from his desk and began groping her. After the aide told him it would get him in trouble, Cuomo then shut the door and said \"I don't care.\" He then returned and groped one of her breasts over her bra by reaching under her blouse. A month later she claimed that Cuomo told her to  what had occurred. On August 8, she revealed her identity: Brittany Commisso.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the New York Assembly approved a separate impeachment investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against Cuomo.\n\nOn March 12, Kaitlin (last name unreported), who formerly worked for the governor's office, alleged that Cuomo had made her feel uncomfortable in various situations, with his comments, questions, requests, and invasions of her personal space. She did not allege inappropriate touching or explicit sexual propositions. Also on March 12, journalist Jessica Bakeman alleged that Cuomo had sexually harassed her by touching her and making inappropriate comments. She wrote: \"I never thought the governor wanted to have sex with me. It wasn't about sex. It was about power. He wanted me to know that I was powerless\".\n\nOn March 18, another journalist, Valerie Bauman, came forward. She said that Cuomo had made her feel uncomfortable, describing him staring at her, entering her personal space, offering her a job, and asking personal questions. Bauman also stated that Cuomo \"never touched [her] inappropriately or said anything that [she] felt [she] could report to [her] boss\". On March 19, Alyssa McGrath, who was still working for Cuomo's office at the time, accused Cuomo of sexually harassing her by ogling her and making inappropriate comments. McGrath did not accuse Cuomo of inappropriate sexual contact. On March 29, Sherry Vill, a New York constituent whose flood-damaged house Cuomo had visited in May 2017, alleged that Cuomo had inappropriately kissed her twice on her cheek during that visit.\n\nAttorney General James's five-month investigation concluded with the release of a report on August 3, 2021. This report concluded that during Cuomo's time in office, he sexually harassed 11 women: Boylan, Bennett, Ruch, Liss, Brittany Commisso, Kaitlin, McGrath, event attendee Virginia Limmiatis, an unnamed New York State trooper and two unnamed state entity employees. The investigation concluded that Cuomo's behaviour included unwanted groping, kissing and sexual comments, and also found that Cuomo's office had engaged in illegal retaliation against Boylan for her allegation against him.\n\nCuomo responded to the report with a denial: \"I never touched anyone inappropriately.\" The report generated public condemnation against the governor and heightened calls for him to resign. On August 3, President Joe Biden called upon Cuomo to resign. The release also prompted district attorneys for Manhattan, Nassau County, Westchester County, Albany County and Oswego County to pursue criminal investigations regarding his behavior.\n\nCuomo later filed a complaint with New York's Supreme Court stating that James had publicly called him a \"serial sexual harasser\" and \"sick and pathetic,\" violating one of the 's responsibilities of a prosecutor stating that, \"In the context of a criminal prosecution, a prosecutor's extrajudicial statement can create the additional problem of increasing public condemnation of the accused,\" Cuomo said.\n\nOn August 10, 2021, despite denying all allegations of sexual harassment, Cuomo announced he would step down as Governor of New York, effective August 24.\n On August 21, Cuomo said that  would not affect his resignation.\n\nOn October 28, 2021, a spokesman for the state court system announced that Cuomo would be charged with a  sex crime in the Albany City Court. However, on January 4, 2022, Albany County District Attorney David Soares dropped a criminal complaint against Cuomo and also announced that Cuomo would not face any other charges related to other groping allegations, citing lack of evidence. Three days later, a judge dropped the criminal charge against Cuomo.\n\nOn December 23, 2021, Nassau county District Attorney Joyce Smith declined filing criminal charges.\n\nOn December 28, 2021, the Westchester County District Attorney declined to issue criminal charges, citing \"statutory requirements\" of New York.\n\nOn January 31, 2022, the fifth and final sexual misconduct case against Cuomo, made by Virginia Limmiatis, was dropped by  district attorney Gregory Oakes, effectively clearing him of all charges.\n\nOn November 24, 2023, Commisso filed a lawsuit against Cuomo alleging sexual harassment under the New York  which extended the time period a victim could sue for sexual assault or harassment that had previously been beyond the statute of limitations. Commisso filed the lawsuit on the last day of the time limit to sue, with the window expiring at midnight on the 24th. The lawsuit alleges a number of inappropriate interactions and actions by Cuomo, and that Commisso hadn't come forward in fear of retaliation; which the suit claims did happen and that then-  demoted her to menial tasks in lower offices. Cuomo's attorney responded claiming that Commisso's claims were false and an attempt at a \"\".\n\n\nCuomo filed for a state retirement pension, to be effective September 1, 2021, based on 14.56 years of state service as attorney general and governor.\n\nOn March 3, 2022, during Cuomo's first public appearance since his resignation, he gave a speech at the God's Battalion of Prayer church in Brooklyn and came out against  and hinted at a political comeback. Cuomo said, \"The press roasted me, my colleagues were ridiculed, my brother was fired. It was ugly. It was probably the toughest time of my life.\" In the speech before an ally's church, he said, \"Contrary to what my political opponents would have you believe, nothing I did violated the law or the regulation.\"\n\nOn March 14, 2022, at an event to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the , Cuomo came out stating his plans to create an organization that will be called \"Progressives for Israel\". As part of his justification for this organization, he stated \"You cannot denounce antisemitism but waver on Israel's right to exist and defend itself but it should be non-Jewish officials who speak first and loudest\". Cuomo later declared \"I am going to call the question for Democrats 'Do you stand with Israel or do you stand against Israel? This came amidst speculation that Cuomo intended to run in the .\n\nIn February 2023, Andrew Cuomo criticized President Biden over the problems stemming from the Mexican border and migrants being displaced within the United States.\n\nSince resigning, Cuomo has been frequently rumored to be mulling a return to electoral politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n in 2000]]\nCuomo married , the seventh child of  and , on June 9, 1990.

The governor responded with, \"I've always been a soft guy. I am the love gov. I'm a cool dude in a loose mood, you know that. I just say, 'Let it go, just go with the flow, baby.' You know.

She was the ninth county executive in Nassau County history and the first woman to hold the office. Curran worked as a reporter before serving in the .\n\n\nCurran was born in , , . She moved frequently as a child, and before turning 18, lived in , , , New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1989, Curran earned a  in Liberal Arts from .\n\n\nCurran previously served in the  from 2014 to 2017 and as a local  member in her hometown of . Prior to holding elective office, Curran worked as a reporter for the '''' and ''''.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Curran won a September 12 primary against Nassau County Comptroller George Maragos, who switched parties from  to .\n\nIn the general election, Curran won a contentious campaign against former  and  Village Mayor . The then sitting Nassau County Executive, , had decided not to run for re-election following an indictment on federal corruption charges.\n\nThe campaign between Curran and Martins touched on gang violence () and runaway property taxes, but ultimately centered on ethics. When polls closed on election night Curran, an underdog in the historically Republican Nassau County, had won 52 percent to 48 percent. She is the third Democrat to hold the position in 80 years.\n\nCurran was sworn into office on January 1, 2018, by then-  on the steps of the Theodore Roosevelt Executive and Legislative Building.\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Laura Curran conceded the race for Nassau County Executive to Republican challenger  and left office on December 31, 2021. She attributed her loss to her name being on the same ballot as  , Democrat of Long Beach, for  . He was the author of the  law that disgruntled many Long Islanders.\n\n\nAmong Curran's first hires were former  President Helena Williams and former New York City Budget Director under Mayor  Mark Page. Williams was the railroad's longest-serving president in several decades, president of the nation's busiest commuter railroad, and the first woman to run any  agency. Page, as director of the city's Office of Management and Budget under NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, oversaw the city's finances through the  terror attacks, the , and .\n\nOther early hires included an assistant state attorney general and former special counsel to the New York State Attorney General Public Integrity Bureau to enforce new ethics and procurement reform policies. Curran also appointed the first permanent commissioner of the Nassau County Police Department in more than four years. Curran's appointment, Patrick Ryder, previously served as commanding officer of the Asset Forfeiture and Intelligence Unit. Within the department, Ryder was largely credited with widespread adoption of new advances in technology to assist in crime reduction. Examples include Nassau's successful use of gunfire locator technology to reduce gun crime.\n  ]]\n\n\nUnder Curran's predecessor, Nassau County froze the tax rolls in 2011. The rolls would remain frozen for nearly seven years. According to an exposè, the policy resulted in a $1.7 billion shift in the property tax burden that largely benefited wealthy residents over low-income, middle-class and elderly residents. In effect, the policy created a \"separate and unequal\" tax assessment and challenge system that benefited those who frequently challenged their annual property tax assessment over others who did not or were unable to do so.\n\nTo address the issue Curran issued an executive order unfreezing the tax rolls in March 2018 and signed legislation that would allow for the reassessment of all county properties by 2019. Additionally, Curran introduced a proposal providing tax relief to the homeowners who shouldered the majority of the tax burden shift under the 2011 freeze. The proposal called for a five-year, partial tax exemption that would be granted to owner of homes built before the freeze began in 2010, are assessed at a high level, and are worth $1&nbsp;million or less. The resulting exemption would primarily benefit middle-income property owners who have not challenged their assessments successfully since the 2011 freeze and resultant tax shift.\n\n\nUpon taking office Curran confronted the growing opioid epidemic which saw the drug claiming a record number of lives in the region. Curran, and Commissioner Ryder, quickly established a tech and intel-driven response to the opioid and heroin crises by working in conjunction with the U.S.   program. Through the HIDTA program Curran and Ryder were able to fund and roll out the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program (OD Map). Through ODMap police track overdoses reported to hospitals, fire and police officials and are able to predict waves of overdoses and try to prevent them as well as the crimes that often follow drug use. Curran, Ryder, and the program gained national attention when early results showed a precipitous drop in both fatal and non-fatal overdoses; 32 and 34 percent respectively.\n\n\nCurran signed an executive order barring appointees from holding leadership positions in political parties or donating to her campaign. At the time the measure was considered to be the first in New York State history. Shortly after, Curran issued a \"zero-tolerance\" executive order banning gift-giving among vendors and employees involved with procurement or contracting procedures. Previously county employees could not accept gifts worth $75 or more.\n\n\nDuring the campaign Curran pledged that if elected she would remove the county executive's name from the county's parks and welcome signs. The pledge was a sharp break with tradition and an unusual measure by political standards. Of the pledge, ''The New York Times'' wrote, \"Across the county's many parks, large signs welcome visitors with the county executive's name in giant letters, with the park's name in a smaller typeface. Ms. Curran has asked the county's public works department to simply remove the county executive's name altogether.\" Curran criticized the signs as self-promotional and a waster of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\nIn opposition to rising public opinion of her electorate and popular sentiment within the New York State Legislature, controlled by the Democratic Party in all three chambers at the time, Curran took a hardline stance against the legalization of recreational marijuana and announced that she intended to have Nassau County opt-out of the clause which would legalize marijuana that was included in an early version of the 2019 New York State Budget.\n\n\nFollowing a measure that eliminated cash bail passed by the New York State Legislature as part of the 2019 budget and was hailed as a landmark progressive legislation by supporters, Curran vigorously spoke out against the legislation to numerous media outlets, appeared on  to oppose bail reform, and continued on efforts to form a coalition against the legislation.\n\n\nCurran lives in , Nassau County, New York, in the town of . She is married and has three daughters.\n\n\n\n\n\n*  at Nassau County Government\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Before his election to Congress, he served eight terms as a man.\n\n\n\nNadler was born into a  family in , the son of Miriam () and Emanuel \"Max\" Nadler. Nadler described his father as a \"dyed-in-the-wool Democrat\" who lost his poultry farm in  when the younger Nadler was seven. In his youth, he attended  ; he is the only member of Congress with a yeshiva education.

However, Weiss died a day before the , and Nadler was nominated to replace Weiss. He ran in two elections on Election Day– a special election to serve the rest of Weiss's eighth term in the old 17th district, and a regular election for a full two-year term in the new 8th district. He won both handily, and has been reelected 15 times with very little opposition. In 2020, Nadler faced a primary challenge from activist Lindsey Boylan; the election was the first time in his tenure that Nadler received less than 75% of the vote. The district was renumbered the 10th district after the 2010 Census.

Ten days later, after Representative  submitted , the full House Judiciary Committee held hearings regarding the process covered solely by . A top  Justice Department official, , was among those testifying for impeachment.\n\nOn a similar note, referring to hypothetical impeachment proceedings against President  that would begin in the newly elected Democrat-controlled House, he suggested a \"three-pronged test\" that \"would make for a legitimate impeachment proceeding\". Such a test would include \"the offenses in question must be so grave\", and \"the evidence so clear\", that \"even some supporters of the president concede that impeachment is necessary\". If it was determined that the president committed an impeachable offense, lawmakers must consider if such an offense would \"rise to the gravity where it's worth putting the country through the trauma of an impeachment proceeding,\" Nadler said.\n\nOn September 24, 2019, Representative  proposed a resolution to remove Nadler from his position as chair of the House Judiciary committee, accusing him of unlawfully beginning impeachment proceedings before the House had given the committee authorization.\n\nNadler served as an  (prosecutor) during the .\n\nFor his tenure as chair of the House Judiciary Committee in the 116th Congress, Nadler earned an \"A\" grade from the non-partisan 's Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.\n\n criticized Nadler for incorrectly claiming following the  that  had taken a gun across state lines and might thus be subject to a federal  review, when in fact he had not.\n\nNadler is a member of the Vote Blue Coalition, a progressive group and  created to support Democrats in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania through voter outreach and mobilization efforts.\n\n\n\n*  (Ranking member)\n\n\n* \n** \n** \n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* House Pro-Choice Caucus\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\nNadler was unhappy with the passage of the surveillance-reform compromise bill, the , saying it \"abandons the Constitution's protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal scrutiny\".\n\n\n\nNadler compared Obama's acceptance of Republican demands to extend Bush-era tax cuts at the highest income levels to someone's being roughed up by the mob, asserting that the Republicans would allow the middle class tax cut only if millionaires and billionaires receive a long-term tax cut as well.\n\nNadler has proposed changing the income tax brackets to reflect different regions and their costs of living, which would have lowered the tax rate for New Yorkers.

A core foundation of our system of government and of democracies across the world, going back hundreds of years, is that the executive cannot unilaterally spend taxpayer money without the legislature's consent.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Nadler voted to support an agreement to lift economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for Iran's compliance with the terms of the agreement which called for substantial dismantling and scaling back of their nuclear program.\n\n\n\nOf Trump's decision to  as the capital of  in December 2017, Nadler said, \"I have long recognized Jerusalem as the historic capital of Israel, and have called for the eventual relocation of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, the seat of the Israeli government.

The developer had received a permit to construct the building, but the judge said the permit should not have been given.\n\n\nIn April 2023, Nadler was one of the 95 co-sponsors of H.Res.319, which calls for the creation of a .\n\n\n in 2024]]\nNadler introduced the  in July 2019 to  at the federal level by removing it from the .

He worked as an aide to Senator , Congresswoman  and City Comptroller  before being elected to the Assembly in 2007.\n\n\nFollowing the appointment of Assemblyman  as Commissioner of New York State's Department of Environment Conservation early in 2007, Kellner was selected as the Democratic nominee for the special election held to fill the vacancy. In that election, held on June 5, 2007, he received 64% of the vote, comfortably defeating his Republican opponent.\n\nDuring the 2013–14 term of the Legislature, Kellner became Chair of the Assembly Committee on Libraries and Education Technology.  On June 27, 2013, Kellner chaired a hearing on \"The Sale of Public Library Buildings in New York City\" at which Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Edmund Morris testified against the 's controversial Central Library Plan.\n\nIn August 2010, New York State's Governor, , signed \"Elle's Law,\" legislation introduced by Kellner that allows for the suspension of up to six months of the New York State driver's license of any driver inflicting serious physical injury on another person while committing a traffic violation. The law was named after Elle Vandenberghe, a three-year-old Upper East Side girl living in Kellner's district who was seriously injured after being struck by a motorist who was illegally backing through an intersection against a red light to find a parking space.\n\nHe also sponsored ''Oreo's Law''  in the New York State Assembly, which required the release of a shelter animal to a rescue group upon request of the rescue group prior to euthanasia of the animal. The law is named in memory of Oreo, a dog who survived abuse at the hands of her former owner, recovered from her injuries, but was then euthanized by the ASPCA in New York City, despite the offer of a No Kill sanctuary to guarantee her lifetime care.\n\n\nIn early 2013, Kellner announced his intentions to run for the New York City Council seat in District 5 being vacated by . Initially, he received significant support, being endorsed by most local elected officials. In late June, however, the ''New York Post'' reported that he had accepted a campaign contribution from a taxi manufacturer whose handicapped-accessible vehicle was being considered for adoption by New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, '''' reported that in 2009 Kellner had engaged in inappropriate Internet chat with a young female staffer. Kellner apologized in a statement to the Times, saying, \"Over four years ago, for a few weeks while I was still single, I exchanged instant messages with a female member of my staff that were flirtatious. It was inappropriate. I was wrong and it was stupid. When I was told that my staffer felt the messages were unprofessional, I immediately stopped and regretted placing her in that position. I was sorry then and I am sorry now.\" The ''New York Daily News'' subsequently quoted an anonymous source identified only as a former Kellner staffer saying that Kellner had made life \"horrible\" for the other staffer after she had allegedly rebuffed his advances.\n\nFollowing the media reports, several elected officials withdrew their endorsement of Kellner in the City Council race, including Lappin, Manhattan Borough President , and two state senators (Jose Serrano and Brad Hoylman).

That December, following an investigation by the Assembly Ethics Committee, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver publicly admonished Kellner for taking actions that created a hostile work environment; Silver also stripped Kellner of a committee chairship and banned him from hiring interns. On December 31, 2013, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that Kellner should deny the sexual harassment allegations or resign.\n\nIn June 2014, Silver announced the closure of Kellner's Albany and district offices, and the elimination of Kellner's staffing budget, on the grounds that Kellner had \"engaged in additional sexual harassment beyond the matters that were the subject of the 2013 investigation,\" as well as hired an intern in spite of being explicitly told he was prohibited from doing so.\n\n\nIn 2014, two challengers announced they would run against Kellner's political club's state committee candidate. When the club's original candidate dropped out of a competitive Democratic primary, Kellner received his club's endorsement. Kellner characterized the win as a favor to his club, and not as an attempt at a political comeback. Following his victory for the obscure position, Kellner insisted it was a myth that he was not popular anymore in his district. Kellner won with nearly 57 percent of the votes in the three-way race.\n\nIn 2015, Kellner was re-nominated by his political club to run for re-election as district leader, an unpaid position he had held since 2012.

The new indictment charged that Skelos procured a position for his son at a medical malpractice insurance company with business before the state, that Adam Skelos was not qualified for the position, that Adam Skelos threatened his supervisor, and that Adam Skelos asserted that \"he didn't need to show up to work because his father was the Majority Leader of the State Senate\".\n\nOn December 11, 2015, a unanimous jury convicted Dean and Adam Skelos of all eight counts of bribery, extortion, and corruption.

The retrial of Skelos and his son began on June 19, 2018. During the retrial, in contrast to the first trial, Skelos took the witness stand and testified in his own defense. On July 17, 2018, Skelos and his son were found guilty of eight felonies.\n\nOn October 23, 2018, Skelos was sentenced to four years and three months in federal prison.

She told the '''''s Local, \"prior to [receiving her master's] I would say I was very inspired by the , Spain. This museum created a whole economy for this particular city after its  died. It made Bilbao and the museum a must destination when visiting Spain. I know that MoCADA can do that for Brooklyn as well.\"\n\nOriginally based in a building operated by the   in the  section of Brooklyn, the institution moved to its current location in the borough's   section within the BAM Cultural District with the help of the 's Local Development Corporation, which included , the  and  , on its board.\nIn 2012, the museum landed a $100,000 grant from the  to pay for a two-year program that brought monthly concerts to public spaces in nearby  Houses like , Ingersoll, and  in Fort Greene that drew crowds up to 500 or 600. The following year, MoCADA launched another art performance series, Soul of Brooklyn, \"a borough-wide celebration of the diverse arts and cultures of Brooklyn's \". From 2001 to 2011, Cumbo served as a graduate professor in the Arts and Cultural Management program at 's School of Art & Design.\n\n\nIn December 2013, one month before she was sworn in, a series of attacks took place targeting Jewish residents of , , totaling at least eight victims including children. The attacks were  to be part of a trend of \" attacks\", and  was cited by a number of community leaders, politicians and media outlets as a precipitating factor. \n\nFollowing the attacks, Cumbo publicly expressed that her African American and  constituents had expressed fear of being \"pushed out of their homes by Jewish s\", and that resentment towards the Jewish residents of Crown Heights \"offer possible  as to how young African-American/Caribbean teens could conceivably commit a '' against a community that they know very little about.\" She wrote \"I admire the Jewish community immensely.... I respect and appreciate the Jewish community's family values and unity that has led to strong political, economic and cultural gains. While I personally regard this level of tenacity, I also recognize that for others, the accomplishments of the Jewish community triggers feelings of resentment, and a sense that Jewish success is not also their success.\" Her response was covered widely on s and in the New York press.\n\nCumbo's statements raised concerns among many residents, and in addition to other local media, the story was featured in local Jewish media outlets. Cumbo later apologized to her constituents for her remarks, saying in a statement, \"I sincerely apologize to all of my constituents for any pain that I have caused by what I wrote ... and I understand now that my words did not convey what was in my heart, which is a profound desire to bring our diverse communities closer together.\" The next year she allocated thousands of dollars in district council money to a  Orthodox Jewish community group.\n\nEarlier, in April 2010, while head of MoCADA, she was quoted in the ''New York Times'''s Local with another remark regarding Jews. She said, \"I'm trying to figure out new ways to do what I want to do to grow the museum.... You have a Jewish children's museum, but you don't feel that there should be a black-centered museum?\"\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, she moved into the  to run for its city council seat. By the end of August 2013, Cumbo's political campaign had received at least $80,000 from Jobs for New York PAC, a pro-development  unpopular in an already rapidly  area. In an -sponsored discussion a week later she claimed she received no money from the  (backers of Jobs for New York), and that they had given no contributions to her campaign. She denied it again when confronted with the issue at a Brooklyn community board committee meeting in February 2015 although she had reportedly claimed to the ''Brooklyn Paper'' (at her 2013 victory party) that she would be more developer-friendly than her predecessor and that \"[I]t would be almost malpractice to be a councilmember and to have no relationship with the developers who are building this community.\"\n\nElected in 2013 in a crowded Democratic primary race, Cumbo, unchallenged by a  candidate, succeeded . She was handpicked to run by Brooklyn Congressman . Cumbo's political leanings are in some ways more conservative than that of her predecessor, and has been the subject of other controversies. She had previously denounced the practice and encouraged voters to blow the whistle on excessive corporate support of political campaigns during her campaign. She did not appear at the public debate before the primary election for the council district seat on August 21, 2013. Despite this, she won the council seat on a platform, in part, of expanding and developing arts and cultural tourism in the district and making improved use of public spaces including parks. \n\nHer platform included \"Investing in Economic Development, Strengthening Not-for-Profits and Service Employees, Reforming Education.\" She was endorsed by Jeffries, New York State Assemblyman , and the .\n\nIn May 2014, she was fined $7,868 by the  for taking contributions above the limit from a group pushing for a ban on the horse-carriage industry.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Cumbo, now an , again defeated one of her 2013 opponents, Ede Fox, in the Democratic primary, 58% to 42%.

She is a member of the Women's Caucus and the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is specifically passionate about women's issues such as domestic violence, workplace discrimination, girls education, and sex trafficking.\n\nIn her first six months in government, when city council members were working on the FY 2015 Budget, she and Council Member , chair of the Public Housing Committee, along with many residents advocated to stop 57 NYCHA community and senior centers from experiencing cuts in funding. As a result, the Council allocated $17 million to keep these centers open.\n\nEarly in October 2014, Cumbo, as chair of the Women's Issues Committee, and her colleague , chair of the Public Safety Issues Committee, announced the council allocated nearly $6 million to support  programs and initiatives. On October 15, 2014, Cumbo joined by Speaker , Rosemonde Pierre-Louis, commissioner for the Mayor's Office to Combat Domestic Violence and other citywide elected officials, posted at subway stations across the city in a campaign that Cumbo organized in order to raise awareness of the problem of domestic violence in honor of \"NYC Go Purple Visibility Day\". She and her office partnered with the \"Not on My Watch!\" campaign back in June 2014.\n\nShe was also in strong support of hosting the  in New York City, specifically Brooklyn, which failed. In arguing in favor of the convention coming to her borough, she argued \"We have swag on lock down,\" continuing, \"A convention anywhere else in the United States of America is just going to be 'eh.'\"  This earned her an ingratiating visit from Senator  at her first \"state of the district\" address at the .\n\nDuring 's campaign for , '''' broke the story of his 2009 arrest in a domestic dispute, the records that had been sealed, which were used by competing candidates. Cumbo, who went to high school with Williams, wrote a letter demanding to know if the law enforcement sources of the story broke city policy in doing so.\n\nIn 2021, Cumbo voted against allowing non-citizens to vote in municipal elections because she claimed it would dilute the power of black voters at the gain of Latino voters, implying Latino residents of the city were largely non-citizens.\n\n\nCumbo made local headlines again in late March 2015 when she asked why there were \"blocs\" (possibly \"blocks\") of Asians living in two Fort Greene housing projects. Colleague and Manhattan councilwoman , who is , said \"She certainly could've chosen her words a bit more carefully. The fact is that there are many Asian-American families . . . who have applied to live in public housing.\" Cumbo issued an apology, but then said she only wanted to know if the  \"uses a cultural preference priority component\" in picking tenants to which  chair  replied that it did not, saying its vacancy rate is less than 1 percent, making such an influx almost impossible. The Brooklyn councilwoman then told the '','' \"There could be some benefit to housing people by culture . . . I think it needs to be discussed.\" Queens Congresswoman , another Asian-American New York City representative, denounced Cumbo's idea, saying that it was \"thinly disguised segregation based on race, color, creed or national origin.\" City council speaker  while defending Cumbo called her comments \"unfortunate.\"\n\nIn 2016, Cumbo was in favor of proceeding with the development of the  with  via a lengthy public review process, despite community opposition, saying \"Let's just continue to negotiate, see what the final outcome is, and if it's satisfactory,\" claiming adjustments could be made along the way.

The new plan passed six months later and still attracted protesters with Jonathan Westin of  saying \"The entire process was fixed from the beginning so the Mayor could push through a deal to one of his favored developers.... Plainly and simply: this is planned gentrification, driven by the gentrification mayor and rubber-stamped by Laurie Cumbo.\"\n\n\nOn March 18, 2022, Mayor  appointed Cumbo as Commissioner of the .\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Her father, Walter, was a local Democratic District Leader and City Council Member during the 1980s. Crowley's mother, Mary, served on the local School Board 24 for a number of years. Following Walter's death in office in 1985, Mary was tapped to finish out the remainder of his term. This made Crowley the third member of her immediate family to serve in the City Council.Lombardi, F.

She did historic preservation work on various landmarks through New York City, including , , and . She is a member of District Council 9 . Crowley also briefly worked as an educator.\n\n\n\n\nOn March 17, 2008,  City Council Member  resigned from office after pleading guilty to two  counts of  stemming from a 2007 incident in which an intoxicated Gallagher forced himself upon an unidentified 52-year-old woman inside his Middle Village District Office. Mayor  subsequently called a  for the following June 3 to fill Gallagher's vacant seat. On May 8, Crowley announced her candidacy, joining a crowded field that included Gallagher's predecessor , a Republican who held the seat until term-limited from office in 2001, city  Commissioner , civic leader Charles Ober, and attorney Joseph Suraci. Crowley and Como received the backing of the county Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, with Ober picking up the  line. Como eked out a victory over Crowley with a margin of just 41 votes.Hogwood, B. (October 23, 2008). \n\nFour months after Como's close victory, Como faced Crowley in the . Crowley anticipated to benefit from a higher turnout due to the historic candidacy of  in a district where Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1. On election day, Crowley defeated Como by 4,369 votes.\n\nFor the third time in 17 months, Crowley ran for the 30th District during the . This time, Crowley faced Ognibene, who had sat out the second 2008 race after the county Republicans passed him over by endorsing Como, despite his stated interest in running. The race quickly turned heated, with Ognibene criticizing Crowley's brief tenure in the Council as \"ineffective,\" while the Democrat in turn painted her 65-year-old challenger as \"out of touch.\" In the end, Crowley proved the stronger candidate, out-fundraising Ognibene and easily beating him in the November election.\n\nIn the ,  defeated Crowley by 137 votes. Holden, a Democrat, had previously lost to Crowley in the primary, but several other parties offered Holden their ballot line in the general and Holden ran as a Republican, Conservative, Reform and \"Dump de Blasio\" candidate.\n\n\nIn 2010, when the city faced serious budget cuts and  planned to close as many as 20 firehouses, Crowley, as Chair of the Council Committee on Fire & Criminal Justice, led a coalition of elected officials and community members to stop the planned closures. Crowley has taken both the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations to task to improve the reliability of the city's 911 system.\n\nCrowley led a fight to preserve and expand City health services for women. Crowley has also sponsored legislation to expand access to HPV vaccinations, birth control and other women's health services. Crowley has pushed the FDNY to double the number of women serving as firefighters in her efforts to improve gender equality among the city's emergency services. In an effort to bring more women to leadership roles in corporations, Crowley sponsored legislation requiring companies receiving city contracts to report the gender and racial makeup of their board members and executives.\n\nOwing to her background in historic preservation, Crowley has worked to protect important local landmarks. In 2013, Crowley joined advocates in successfully lobbying the city's  (LPC) to confer landmark status on the century-old , one of the last works of master carver Daniel Carl Muller, culminated a 40-year battle by the Woodhaven community to secure official landmark status for the beloved carousel.(May 11, 2016). ]] That same year, Crowley oversaw the reopening of a nature preserve at the former , a decommissioned 19th Century reservoir located in  on the – border. This represented the culmination of a years-long effort by Crowley to maintain the site's natural character. The city  under Mayor  had previously announced a number of proposals that would have limited public access to the site and installed sports facilities and comfort stations in two of the reservoir's three basins. However, in response to strong local opposition and a petition garnering over 1,000 signatures, Crowley joined with fellow elected officials in writing to New York Governor  to oppose the city's plan. Crowley subsequently secured Council funding towards a $7 million renovation that preserved the site as a nature area, while installing new fencing and lighting, and repaving walkways.\nIn November 2016, Crowley presided over a ceremony to official inaugurate the , a 40-block area including nearly 1,000 historic homes and buildings. At the time of its designation, Central Ridgewood is the largest historic district in the borough of Queens, and the third largest in the city after Manhattan's  and Brooklyn's .\n\n\n\nStarting in 2015, Crowley joined preservationists and local residents in mounting a campaign to landmark historic  in Woodhaven. Considered to be the oldest bar in the city, it has been a neighborhood watering hole for more than 180 years and was prominently featured in the  film ''''.\nIn May 2016, Crowley attended a rally at the Tavern with more than 100 local residents to call on the LPC to recognize the building. Crowley criticized the body for falling to prioritize the landmarking of historic sites in the borough. The proposal was rejected by the LPC, according to the bar's owner, because \"Neir's Tavern does not rise to the level of significance to warrant landmark status\" and that landmark status would not protect the site from future development.\n\nIn August 2016, city officials announced plans to house 110 homeless adult families at a  in Maspeth. Crowley declared her opposition to the planned shelter, noting the impact on the community of two existing homeless shelters along  and pledging to \"[work] with community leaders and residents\" to halt the Maspeth proposal. The following week,  Commissioner Steve Banks held a public meeting to present the plan to the community, drawing more than 1,000 residents opposed to the plan. Crowley also addressed the crowd, reiterating her opposition to the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrowley was married to Dennis O'Hara, a New York City police officer. They have two sons, Dennis and Owen.

She graduated from  in 1973.\n\n\nSmith entered politics as a , and was a deputy in the office of the City Clerk of New York City. She was a member of the  from 1989 to 2006. Her district was centered in the  section of .\n\nSmith was the ranking minority member of the Senate's Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee, and gained notoriety for several brushes with the law. She was backed by her party organization in the 2006 Democratic Senate primary election but lost to challenger ,  who also won the general election later that year.\n\n\nIn 1996, Senate staffer LaSone Garland-Bryan accused Smith of  her with a knife while they were alone in Smith's office. According to Garland-Bryan's statement, the senator became angry when she overheard Garland-Bryan telling family members that Smith \"sometimes forgot to take her medication\". Garland-Bryan declined to press charges, but wrote an official complaint about the incident to then- , who responded by asserting that he had \"no authority\" to punish Smith.\n\nSmith faced charges in 1998 after allegedly biting the hand of a police officer in Brooklyn. She was subdued with mace by the authorities during that altercation.\n\nIn 2004, Smith refused to hand over her driver's license to authorities at a police checkpoint at a state garage in Albany; instead, she drove into the parking garage. A state trooper had to step out of the way of her oncoming vehicle. Smith's actions led to a conviction; following that conviction, then-Senate Minority Leader  removed her from a leadership post.\n\nIn 2004, a former Smith staffer, Wayne Mahlke, alleged that Smith had subjected him to verbally abusive comments relating to sexual orientation. The following year, the state's Division of Human Rights dismissed his claims due to insufficient evidence.\n\nSmith attacked a staffer, Jennifer Jackson, on March 21, 2006, in Smith's Albany office. The senator arrived at the office following a  meeting that morning and mentioned that she had lost 4.3 pounds. Jackson told police that she replied, \"'at the rate you go around, I would have thought you'd lose 20 pounds'\". Jackson claimed that Smith cursed and threw hot coffee in her eyes. Before leaving the office, Jackson allegedly told Smith, \"'Senator, you can't do this to people. It's abusive'\". Smith allegedly pulled off Jackson's hairpiece, threw it to the floor, and said, \"'If you tell anyone what happened in this office, I will fing kill you'\". Jackson was treated for injuries to her eyes, neck, and shoulders. Smith's lawyer denied the charges and accused Jackson of lying to authorities, claiming that Jackson actually told the senator she needed to lose 100 pounds. In the aftermath of the coffee attack, then-Senate Minority Leader  stripped Smith of her state-issued car, her honorary title, and a $9,500 per year  attached to her leadership position. Paterson stated that the coffee attack was the latest example of what he called \"a pattern of inappropriate, unprofessional and often abusive behavior\" from Smith.\n\nSmith was charged with assault in the third degree, a misdemeanor, in connection with the coffee attack on Jackson. She pleaded not guilty in Albany City Court. In August 2006, Smith was convicted of  . She was fined and ordered to attend an anger management program. Smith was also ordered to pay any medical expenses incurred by Jackson in connection with the attack that were not covered by insurance.\n\nIn 2006, ''The New York Times'' reported that tabloids referred to Smith as \"'the Wild Woman of Albany'\".\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He had been an All-High basketball player in Florida and became an All-Europe player during his Army  in Germany, where he ran a program for s.   After completing his Army service he returned to Buffalo in 1955.   Eve's first job in Buffalo was in a  plant. While working there he became aware of drugs problems with local youths in the city's parks, and observed a lack of guidance for youth in the community. He surrendered his job to pursue a post in parks recreation, but learned that such jobs were doled out by  to party loyalists.  Eve joined the Democratic Party and got one of the patronage parks jobs.Levy and Miller, p. 47  By 1958, he was blossoming as an independent activist within the party, pursuing minority rights, and was the only ward leader who was not part of the political establishment.  This role led to his 1966 New York State Assembly election victory.\n\nEve and Constance Bowles (born July 14, 1932), also an  of West Virginia State College, were married in June 1956.--> They have one daughter and four sons: , Arthur O.

Eve rose to prominence in the mid-1960s during Buffalo's civil disturbances and rights. He expanded his notability during the Attica Prison riots. During the , Eve attempted to organize formal meetings in order to avert physical confrontations. Eve fought against union policies which disallowed minority participation in apprentice programs that led to high paying  jobs on state construction sites.  He threatened   that he would lie down in front of s at one of these sites.Levy and Miller, p. 48 In 1968, he delayed construction on the 's Amherst Campus to push through an agreement that New York State and the unions would promote minority access into the construction industry.  The protests by supporters of Eve's effort caused Rockefeller to call for an eleven-month construction moratorium starting in March 1969.\n\n.|upright]]\nIn April 1969, the construction of the  (originally known as the Harlem State Office Building) at  and  became a political quagmire. Originally, Rockefeller had proposed a 20-story office building and a 10-story cultural and civic center, but the legislature only approved funding for the office building.  Eventually, there was protesting by the  community that halted construction. Eve brokered discussions between Rockefeller and State Senator , who represented the disgruntled Harlem community.\n\nDuring Eve's first term as an assemblyman, he led the effort to obtain an initial $500,000 ($}} as of ) of funding to establish the  system's SEEK/Educational Opportunity Program. Since the 1970s, colleges in New York State have administered the Arthur O. Eve  to assist students who may otherwise be unable to attend college because of educational and financial circumstances.  Later, in 1988, he would receive the  Distinguished Leadership in Arts-in-Education award.\n\n|alt=wall of building with text that says Attica Correctional Facility.  Flags are visible outside at half-staff.]]\nIn the late 1960s, Eve drove a constituent to Attica State Prison, which is  from Buffalo.Levy and Miller, p. 49 After observing the prison's conditions, he began to introduce prison reform legislation to the state assembly. Since most legislators were fearful of political backlash and avoided prison reform issues, Eve became the primary channel through which prisoners could forward their complaints and requests. His compassion for the prisoners was recognised by them.Levy and Miller, p. 51 For example, in the months following the eight-hour November 4, 1970, seizure of the , Eve was the only legislator named as a recipient of prisoner complaints.\n\n\nEve served as an observer and negotiator in the wake of the 1971 Attica Prison riot. Believing that the situation called for people who were credible to both the prison population as well as to people involved with and observing the situation from outside the prison, he joined  and , among others, in entering the prison to hear the inmates' demands. Eve was the first mediator to arrive at the scene of the rebellion. He was the first elected official to enter the prison yard following the riot in which 42 prisoners were taken, and he led the September 11 tour by the requested visitors to the seized Cellblock D as well as other areas of the prison. The prisoners requested direct communication with the Commissioner of Corrections, Russell G. Oswald, and that specific individuals hear their demands, naming , , and ; Kunstler eventually agreed to serve as their legal counsel.  The primary prisoner demand was that, upon surrendering control of the prison back to the guards, they not be beaten.Levy and Miller, p. 52 Farrakhan refused to attend to the situation in person, however, which Eve felt was a turning point in the negotiations.  Eve has expressed the belief that Governor Rockefeller was responsible for the massacre that subsequently occurred in the prison, and that Rockefeller made a deliberate decision to escalate the conflict knowing that there would likely be some loss of life. After negotiations stalled over a demand for amnesty, a rescue operation saved 29 hostages and led to 10 inmate deaths.  Eve was critical of Rockefeller's decision to not come observe the prison and the negotiations but rather pursue tactical measures: \"I think Governor Rockefeller ought to be indicted.\"  In the 1992 Attica civil-liability trial, Eve testified on behalf of the inmates. In March 2001, then New York Governor  appointed Eve to the Attica Task Force that met with families of Attica prison employees who survived the 1971 uprising and negotiated reparations.\n\nIn February 1971, Eve sponsored two bills.  One called for a minimum of 0.5% of construction funds be allocated to  for construction workers. The other was an initiative to have  be decentralized like  had been the prior year.\n\nIn the 1974 elections, New York State Democratic Chairman, Joseph Crangle, attempted to block Eve from obtaining the Democratic nomination. After the 1974 election, Eve was the senior Assemblyman among the blacks and Puerto Ricans.  Following the 1974 elections in which 15 of the 18 newly Democratic seats were from non-New York City Democrats, the upstate delegation was credited with giving the democrats a majority.  That year marked the year in which upstate democrats demanded that there be some division of the Democratic minority leader, Democratic deputy minority leader, Assistant minority leader, minority whip, and ranking member of the Ways and Means committee, which had all previously been given to New York City officials. Incoming Governor  was also interested in a geographic division of key positions in order to promote party unity. Eve sat on a 1978 Medicaid reimbursement evaluation committee.\n\n\n\nOn March 3, 1977, Buffalo's  mayor  announced he would not seek reelection in May; on the same day, Eve announced his candidacy for the post.Rizzo, pp. 344-345 Despite his numerous successes at fostering communication, he was described as a militant civil rights leader. Eve's primary campaign was described by Frank Prial of '''' as a campaign against Crangle rather than his handpicked candidate, Leslie Foschio. Eve declared his intentions early to add incentive to a voter registration drive, and he modeled his campaign after ' 1967  election, which used decentralized election districts.Levy and Miller, p. 58 Although he was expected to finish no better than third in the four-way race, he believed in a strategy to take 90 percent of the black vote and 10 percent of the rest. 30% of the 425,000 Buffalo residents were black at the time.  Eve's candidacy blossomed during the four televised Democratic debates. Eve capitalized on 's late campaign strategy of describing the Mayor job as simple like all jobs.  Eve and his supporters supposedly registered 10,000 new black voters.\n\nEve became the first African-American to win the Democratic Party's  . Eve won the primary for the Democratic nomination by a 25,538&ndash;23,579 (approximately 37%&ndash;34%) margin over Griffin. Eve's victory brought out acts of racist aggression against him and his family, as a cross was burned on his front lawn and his family was subjected to threatening telephone calls.\n\nGriffin subsequently became the Conservative Party's nominee; third-placed primary finisher Foschio also threatened to enter the general election. Eve was supported by  Democratic Chairman Joseph Crangle, who hoped to prevent a third Democrat, such as Foschio, from running in the general election by endorsing Eve publicly, but Eve campaigned without Crangle's backing or that of the Democratic Party.  Eve spurned Chairman Crangle's endorsement because the endorsement would have caused him to be associated with the Crangle machine. He subsequently distanced himself from Crangle by announcing that he was not supporting the chairman's bid for re-election in 1978. The 1977 Buffalo Mayoral primary had had a   of 77–80% in the Black community, the highest ever for an African American community in the , and surpassed nationwide in terms of African American voter turnout only by the 1967  election of Carl Stokes. Griffin went on to win the general election by a ten percent margin over Eve, beating him and Republican candidate John J. Phelan out.\n\n\nBy 1978 Eve had attained the title of Deputy Majority Leader.  Eve, who had been chairperson of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus in 1975 and 1976, was appointed Deputy Speaker of the New York State Assembly during the 1979 legislative session.  Because of the lack of minority representation in either  of the , as Deputy Speaker, Eve was the highest-ranking black legislator while in office. In 1979, the Democratic majority fell from 90&ndash;60 to 86&ndash;64, while the caucus' Assembly membership had grown from 15 to 16. This meant that the caucus had a much stronger position to obstruct legislation by withholding it votes, since 76 votes were necessary for legislation to pass. In 1980, Eve resumed his chairmanship of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. The following year, Eve was elected unanimously to a committee to study state election law when he complained that no blacks were on the committee even though he said his complaint should have not been taken as an effort to lobby for a position.\n\nEve and fellow Democrat Griffin remained political rivals throughout their careers. In 1982, Griffin and  , each of whom had first been elected as the mayor of one of New York State's two largest cities in 1977, were considering running together for Governor and .  Eve adamantly opposed the ticket, speaking in support of . Eventually, Griffin decided not to pursue statewide office. In 1983, Deputy Speaker Eve was no longer Caucus Chairman.\n\nIn 1984, Eve joined with James F. Notaro, the  chairman to create the \"Coalition for a Better Buffalo\", with the sole intention of identifying a candidate for the Democratic and Liberal party lines who could unseat Griffin. Following Cuomo's 1982 New York State Governors general election victory, Eve became critical of Cuomo's  approach to budget balancing, and was acknowledged by Cuomo as a voice of opposition which represented interests such as .  Eve also served as an adviser to  during his , and after Jackson named his two delegates to the 1984 Democratic Party platform committee, he named Eve as his first alternate.  In 1984, Eve was among those involved in a controversy over the use of a state plane to attend a dinner for Paterson.  Questions arose about whether it was a community event or a political event due to the possibility that the funds raised at the dinner might be used for a Mayoral campaign. Even after Cuomo was succeeded by Pataki, Eve continued to voice opposition to any attempts to balance the state's budget by cutting taxes. In 1985, Eve sponsored legislation to provide scholarships for the underprivileged and to fund precollege enrichment programs that was described by President of the Associated Medical Schools of New York Dr. Robert Friedlander as landmark.\n\nIn 1986, Eve was a contender to replace  as , but the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus was not unified in its efforts to endorse a candidate.  Most minority assembly members voted for 's  due to the influence of downstate party organizers. Eve was outspoken in his opposition to the status quo;  in 1988, he opposed all three incumbents for the New York State . In June 1988, Eve spearheaded a group of 12 black state ticket committee members who protested the absence of a black candidate on the state ticket of Cuomo,  and , by voting for another candidate, but he was not joined in protest by  leaders  and . In November 1988, he was also among the few lawmakers to vote against the budget cuts and the first to call for a delay in their enactment. Eve's outspokenness occasionally attracted opposition to his own interests, as it did later that same year. During his 1988 re-election campaign, he encountered opposition from the minority ranks within the legislature, caused by his alleged involvement in the orchestration of a campaign against  Democrat Cynthia Jenkins.  As a result, she campaigned on behalf of Eve's opponent Dorsey Glover; Jenkins prevailed in her .  During the , Eve endorsed Jackson over  and .  In 1993, he endorsed , the president of the , for  in a race against , , the Bronx Borough President, Assemblyman , and .  In both 1989 and 1993, Eve considered running for mayor.Rizzo, pp. 367&ndash;368 His wife opposed the 1989 campaign. In 1993, he felt he would have the opportunity to have a Buffalo Mayor he had a working relationship with if  were to become mayor, and he, therefore declined to run so that he could endorse Masiello.\n\nIn 2000, Eve was challenged by , a member of  and the majority leader of the Erie County Legislature.  The race was described by '''' as the toughest election contest of Eve's political career.  During the race, which was Eve's 18th and final New York State Assembly election campaign, Peoples depicted him as part of the antiquated old guard.  Eve responded by summoning political connections including  ,  , New York State Assembly Speaker , Representative  and his son Eric, who was a veteran New York State campaign manager.  Peoples-Stokes's Democratic  challenge was almost successful, and it was credited with energizing minority voters to elect  as a .\n\nIn 2000, Eve proposed that Pataki declare March 10 as  day, in honor of the African-American abolitionist who helped bring about the emancipation of many slaves. In 2001 Eve began efforts to have the day declared a state holiday, but the legislation  failed passage in the New York State Senate.  Tubman had lived over 50 years in , New York, where the Harriet Tubman House is located. The movement to commemorate her spread to her  state, Maryland.  Eve continued his efforts in 2002, but the legislation did not pass until 2003, after his retirement.\n\n\nEve is recognized as \"a leader on just about every issue that's important to families\", according to , and for his services to the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, as well as to the committee of public officials who attempted to resolve the conflict at the Attica State Prison.  Eve's major emphasis is on those at the very bottom of society; he believes that a nation should be judged by how it attends to the needs of its lowest citizensthe homeless, the chronically poor, and the working poor, among whom blacks are numbered disproportionately.\n\nEve campaigned for the increased availability of  services.  He  legislated against s and advocated against the expansion of legalized  to s that would effectively tax the economically disadvantaged, although the gambling legislation was nevertheless approved.  Eve noted that the vast majority of lottery tickets were bought by those in the lower income bracket, and advocated for greater representation in the New York State jury pools by the economically disadvantaged.  He also urged restraint in banking .\n\n\n  has described Eve's retirement as a significant loss and an example of why he opposes s.  A few months after retiring from political office Eve established a foundation whose first mission was to fight for the money allocated for the tutoring of students from underperforming schools, which was being redirected to other purposes.  By 2004, New York State approved Eve's foundation to provide afterschool tutoring.  He continued to serve on the Pataki task force that had been created in March 2001 to compensate family members of the 11 state workers killed in the 1971 Attica prison riots, and he remained active in discussions regarding the allocation of the state . In February 2008, the Brighter Choice Charter School for Boys in Albany dedicated its new conference hall in his honor.\n\nIn 2005, Eve's daughter Leecia announced her intention to run for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 2006.  When  announced he had selected  to be his running mate for the 2006 New York State Elections, there was some controversy because Eve had been joined by Dinkins, Rangel,  and Basil Paterson (who is David Paterson's father) in endorsing his daughter.\n\nIn May 2023, Governor  appointed Eve's daughter  as Chair of the  Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*  (2020).

The same day, Collins traveled to a Manhattan federal courthouse and pleaded guilty to insider trading and lying to the FBI. Had Collins attempted to stay in Congress after pleading guilty, his role would have likely been very limited. Longstanding House rules state that a member convicted of a felony should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the  reviews the matter. Although there is no constitutional rule barring a convicted felon from voting, McCarthy and the Republican leadership would have strongly discouraged Collins from doing so, and the House Ethics Committee has indicated in the past that convicted felons can be disciplined if they do take part in committee or floor votes.\n\nOn December 9, 2019, Collins and the  agreed that Collins will \"be permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of any public company\".

Also, Griffo \"was able to prevent a tax hike there in all but one of his years in office, despite the crippling loss of  in 1993 – perhaps the worst single economic blow the county has ever seen.\" Griffo merged the parks and recreation departments and handed over the city's weights and measures and emergency management departments to the county, resulting in savings. To prevent closures and service cuts, he privatized Rome Hospital, the Erie Canal Village, and city trash collection services.\n\nGriffo brought  to Rome; this effort earned him the nickname \"The Rock N' Roll Mayor.\" The concert was held at the decommissioned . Woodstock '99 attracted over 200,000 people but was plagued my many problems, including inadequate staffing, widespread sexual assault, and profiteering by event organizers.\n\n\nGriffo was appointed Oneida County executive in June 2003 to serve out the term of his predecessor. Griffo was then elected to the post in November 2003. After raising taxes 16% for 2003, his predecessor had announced that taxes for 2004 might need to be raised by as much as 26% due to skyrocketing Medicare costs and retirement benefits. However, after Griffo was appointed county executive, he was able to balance the 2004 budget while raising taxes by 2.9%. In 2005, he implemented a prescription drug plan that cut drug costs for Oneida county residents by up to 38%.\n\nGriffo increased the county sales tax 1.5% in the 2005 budget to cover Medicaid costs. Normally, sales tax revenues are split amongst state, county and townships/cities. However, in order to cover mandated Medicaid costs, the 1.5% increase would all go to the county government. Utica Mayor Tim Julian began claiming a share of the revenues. Griffo remained adamant in refusing to split the revenues. Griffo tried to disarm the situation by offering the city of Utica $800,000 in debt forgiveness, which Julian refused. Griffo eventually won out and the county did not split the extra sales tax revenues with Utica.\n\nGriffo helped stop the New York Regional Interconnect (NYRI) plan to run electricity from Canada through Oneida County. Concerned citizens feared the project would increase electricity costs in the area and pose health and safety risks to residents.

He replaced , who instead ran unsuccessfully for Congress that year. Among Griffo's significant legislation was a law that created the website ResultsNY.gov, which allowed residents to monitor how state funds were being used. Griffo voted against same-sex marriage legislation on December 2, 2009. In 2011, Griffo voted against allowing same-sex marriage in New York during a Senate roll-call vote on the Marriage Equality Act, which the Senate passed in a close 33–29 vote.\n\nIn December 2018, Griffo was appointed deputy minority leader of the State Senate. In January 2019, he was appointed acting minority leader after Minority Leader  sought treatment for alcoholism.\n\n\nGriffo is married to Lorraine Griffo, an elementary school teacher.\n\n\nGriffo was arrested on August 1, 1988, after allegedly serving alcohol or permitting alcohol to be served to minors at a party he hosted. His case was discharged under contemplation of dismissal. After his arrest, Griffo accused the officer who arrested him of being 'disgruntled', despite the Rome Police having legitimate grounds for an arrest.  Later the Rome Democratic Party hired attorney Robert Abrams to probe into Rome Judge James Kehoe's disposition of charges against Joseph Griffo.\n\nGriffo was involved in a two-vehicle collision on East Oak Street in Rome. Police said the state senator caused the crash at the stop sign intersection at North James Street. The young female victim in the other car complained of shoulder pain, was later taken to Rome Memorial Hospital by a family member, police stated.

Later that year, Stringer organized a counter-rally to a  march.\n\nOn August 28, 2001, '''' political writer  wrote a piece entitled, \"Mother Dearest & the Courthouse Cabal,\" in which he discussed Stringer's involvement in courtroom politics, specifically questioning how Stringer's parents had benefited financially from his political ties, and whether some of his campaign contributors had done unethical things. Barrett also raised questions about whether acting Supreme Court judge Louis York had attempted to gain Stringer's support in his bid for a full term on the court by appointing Stringer's mother nine times as a court evaluator and conservator.

His candidacy was endorsed by ''The New York Times''. In September 2005, he won the Democratic primary against 9 other candidates and was later elected in the November general election. He took office as Borough President on January 1, 2006.\n\nStringer issued over 40 policy reports designed to raise awareness about local issues and improve New York City. These reports have led the charge in addressing many of Manhattan's most important challenges and issues, including: increasing community input and response to development and planning projects across the borough; introducing comprehensive reform and empowerment measures to Manhattan's Community Boards; leading the fight to maintain and create new affordable housing units and schools  across the borough; empowering parents to better participate in the public school system; investigating and recommending policy action on the city's many transportation issues; and helping working families and small businesses access resources to become and remain self-sufficient.\n\n\nIn November 2008 and December 2009 as Borough President, he hosted day-long conferences on the subject of progressive .

After numerous constituent complaints, in 2010 he undertook a survey, \"Respect the Lane – Clear the Path\", a policy report analyzing bike lane safety in Manhattan. During the course of the three-day survey, a total of 1,700 infractions were witnessed. The survey found that while bike lanes have a tremendous positive impact on New York City, the lanes were being misused by all parties; pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists. Working with community leaders, elected officials, local businesses, and local residents, Stringer worked to raise awareness about bike lane safety, and recommended an \"increase in protected bicycle lanes, which are separated from traffic by a physical barrier and stepped-up patrol by traffic enforcement agents to ticket scofflaws, along with better signage,\" among other ideas.\n\n\n\nStringer led the fight in New York City against  in New York State. Stringer hosted many Manhattan Community Boards to discuss the potential problems associated with \"fracking\", such as contamination to the water supply.

His Republican opponent, David Casavis, a history professor and foreign affairs writer/commentator, got 16% of the vote on a platform to abolish the office. In an October 5, 2009 article in ''City Limits'', Stringer dismissed calls by Casavis and Mayor  to eliminate his office: \"There are people who are going to call for the elimination of the public advocate office, borough president, the City Council. There are people who believe that we should have a king system here,\" says Stringer. \"Borough presidents are part of a new era and a different kind of government. It has real responsibilities and it gives you a large footprint on the issues you get involved with. It's up to the individual to take advantage of that, that you might have an impact.\"\n\n\n\nIn Spring 2009, Stringer considered a  to   . However, he announced in May 2009 that he would not run. In his statement he said: \"In light of President Obama's clear desire to avoid a Democratic primary in New York State, I have decided to focus on my re-election race for Manhattan Borough President and to suspend my exploratory committee and fund-raising efforts for the . I firmly believe that innovative thinking on issues like education and the urban environment must be joined with bedrock Democratic values on gun control and immigration if New York's interests are to be effectively represented in Washington.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStringer was the Democratic nominee for New York City Comptroller in . He defeated former New York Governor  in the Democratic primary.\n\nStringer was considered one of several contenders for the 2013 New York City Mayoral primary before he announced in mid-November 2012 that he would instead run for  in the .

Stringer, originally thought to have the lead unopposed, trailed Spitzer in the polls until late August, when he took a two-point lead. Stringer defeated Spitzer in the September 10 primary 52%–48%. In the days prior to the Democratic primary, several media outlets published a piece describing Stringer's vote against legislation that stripped  of its tax-exempt status.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Stringer criticized the health department's response to complaints about  as \"weak\", because they failed in their oversight and their inability to follow their own procedures.\n\nIn November 2014, Comptroller Stringer announced an initiative, on behalf of the $160 billion New York City Pension Funds, to give long-term shareholders the right to nominate their own directors at 75 U.S. companies. The \"proxy access\" initiative, known as the Boardroom Accountability Project, requests that these companies change their bylaws to allow shareholders who meet a threshold of owning three percent of a company for three or more years the right to list their director candidates, representing up to 25 percent of the board, on a given company's proxy. Proxy access is the ability for shareowners to nominate directors to run against a company's chosen slate of director candidates on the corporate ballot. The 75 proposals were filed based on three priority issues: climate change, board diversity and excessive CEO pay. Stringer called proxy access \"the defining issue for the 2015 proxy season\".\n\n\nIn 2017, there was no Democratic primary for the position with Stringer defeating Republican  in the general election.\n\n\n\nOn September 8, 2020, Stringer formally announced his candidacy for Mayor of New York City. He was endorsed by a number of progressive politicians shortly after his announcement, such as , , , , , , , and others. At his announcement, he criticized incumbent mayor de Blasio saying: \"We never closed the book on a tale of two cities. If anything over the last eight years, we've written more chapters.\"\n\nIn late April 2021, a woman accused Stringer of sexual misconduct when she volunteered on his 2001 Public Advocate campaign. Despite the loss of some supporters, Stringer maintained his bid in the mayoral race. Following the accusations, Stringer lagged behind  and  in the polls. A second woman accused him of sexual misconduct in June 2021.\n\nStringer finished in fifth place with 5.0% of the vote.\n\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Stringer announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to determine whether he should run for mayor in the .\n\n\nOn September 3, 2010, Stringer married Elyse Buxbaum, an arts administrator at the time, who is the deputy director of development at .

Their son, Pataki's father, was Louis P. Pataki (1912–1996), a  and volunteer fire chief, who ran the Pataki Farm. Pataki's maternal grandfather was Matteo Laganà (born in , Italy in 1889), who married Agnes Lynch of , Ireland around 1914. Their daughter, Margaret Lagana (1915–2017), is Pataki's mother. Pataki has an older brother, Louis. Pataki speaks some  as well as Spanish, French, and German.\n\nAfter graduating from , Pataki entered  in 1963 on an academic  and graduated in 1967. While there, Pataki was  of the Conservative Party of the , where he participated in debates. He received his  from  in 1970.\n\n\n in 1987]]\nWhile practicing law at Plunkett and Jaffe, P.C. in Peekskill, Pataki became friends with , who would go on to be the architect of Pataki's ascendancy to power.Revkin, Andrew. \"\".

Finnegan was then appointed chief counsel to the governor in 1995, and played the key role in developing and negotiating nearly all of Pataki's early legislative success.Hernandez, Raymond. \"\". ''''. August 15, 1997.\n\n\nPataki first won elected office in November 1981. He was elected mayor of the city of Peekskill, which is located in the northwestern part of Westchester County. Pataki defeated Democratic incumbent Fred Bianco Jr., winning 70% of the vote. In November 1983, he was re-elected mayor, winning 74% of the vote.\n\n\nIn November 1984, Pataki was elected to the New York State Assembly (91st District), by defeating one-term Democratic incumbent William J. Ryan, winning 53% of the vote. In November 1986, Pataki defeated Ryan in a rematch, capturing 63% of the vote. Pataki won a third term in November 1988, winning 74% of the vote against Democratic candidate Mark Zinna. Pataki won a fourth and final term in November 1990, winning over 90% of the vote, as he only faced a minor party candidate. He was an assemblyman in the , ,  and s.\n\n\nFrom 1983 to 1992, the 91st Assembly district included parts of Westchester, Orange, Rockland, and Putnam Counties. However, in 1992, Assembly Democrats substantially redrew the district boundaries, placing the newly renamed 90th Assembly district entirely within . Instead of running in the newly redrawn district, Pataki decided to challenge seven-term incumbent  State Senator  in a Republican primary in Senate District 37 by criticizing her for taking her grandchildren to Disney World and missing a vote in . Pataki won the primary by a 52% to 48% margin. However, Goodhue still planned to appear on the November ballot on a minor party line. In November 1992, Pataki won the general election. He served in the Senate during the  and ran for governor at the next election.\n\n\n\n\nPataki was a first-term state senator from  when he launched his bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 1994. He said he launched the campaign because of his frustration in the Senate regarding how  worked and on tax issues. Pataki's campaign received a boost when he was endorsed by U.S. Sen. . He received the party's endorsement at the spring state convention and easily defeated former State Republican Chairman Richard Rosenbaum in the September primary. Pataki was considered an underdog from the start since he was running against three-term Gov.  and because Pataki had little name recognition statewide. D'Amato reportedly backed Pataki because of a poll that showed a , fiscal conservative from the New York City suburbs could win statewide for governor. The poll also showed a female running mate for  would help the ticket.  Academic  was chosen as Pataki's running mate.\n\nThe polls had Governor Cuomo ahead by as many as ten points going into the final two weeks, but they narrowed at the end. Pataki made an issue of Cuomo seeking a fourth term as governor and pledged to serve only two terms in office. Cuomo was helped late in the race by the endorsement of New York City Mayor . Pataki narrowly defeated Cuomo in the general election. Many, including Pataki himself, believed 's endorsement of Pataki was a major reason for his win. He finished with 48.8% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.5%, and independence candidate  finished with 4.2%.\n\nPataki made up for a soft performance in New York City by running up a decisive margin outside of it, especially among upstaters disenchanted with Cuomo. Pataki won all but one county outside the Five Boroughs. Pataki became New York's first elected Republican governor since Nelson Rockefeller.\n\n\n\nPataki was considered the front-runner from the start of the 1998 campaign for governor. He was unopposed for the Republican nomination and paired with a new running mate, Judge . The Democrats faced a primary battle between New York City Council Speaker , Lt. Gov. , who had switched parties, and former Transportation Commissioner James LaRocca. Vallone captured the Democratic nomination, with  running as the Independence nominee and McCaughey Ross as the Liberal Party nominee. Pataki was easily reelected to a second term in office. He finished with 54.3% of the vote, his highest percentage finish in a gubernatorial race, to Vallone's 33.2% and Golisano's 7.7%. This is the last time a Republican has won a majority in a statewide election in New York, and the first time since , when  was re-elected.\n\n\n\nPataki was considered a strong contender for a third term, despite having pledged in 1994 to serve only two terms. He ran again on a ticket with Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue and the Democrats faced a primary battle between State Comptroller  and former HUD Secretary , Mario Cuomo's son. Pataki emphasized his previous work and the need to have continuity following Sept. 11.\n\nMcCall essentially secured the Democratic nomination when Andrew Cuomo stumbled (and ultimately withdrew before the primary at the urging of his mentor ); Cuomo was quoted in the media as saying, regarding Pataki's performance post-9/11:\n\nPataki stood behind the leader. He held the leader's coat. He was a great assistant to the leader. But he was not a leader. Cream rises to the top, and Rudy Giuliani rose to the top.\n\nPataki sought the nomination of the  in his bid for a third term as well. He faced the party's founder and 1994 and 1998 nominee, , in his bid for the nomination. Pataki ran an active primary campaign and lost to Golisano. Donohue did win the primary for lieutenant governor and was the running mate of both Pataki and Golisano in the general election.\n\nIn the general election, Pataki defeated McCall and Golisano easily. As in 1998 due to Golisano's presence on the ballot, Pataki did not win a majority, instead winning a plurality. Pataki won 49.4% of the vote, and McCall only mustered 33.5% with wins in four of the five New York City boroughs. Golisano finished with the highest vote total of his political career, and the highest vote total for any candidate of the  in any statewide election.\n\nThis was the last time a Republican was elected , and the last time a Republican has cracked over 41% in a gubernatorial election until the 2022 election in which Republican candidate Congressman  amassed 47% of the vote against incumbent Democrat .\n\n\nBy the summer of 2005, opinion polls indicated that Pataki would face an uphill battle if he sought a fourth term in 2006. Accordingly, he announced on July 27, 2005, that he would not do so, saying that New York was \"a better state than it was 10 years ago\" and that he was retiring so he could \"follow a new path, find new challenges.\" He was succeeded by Democrat .\n\n\n\n\nAs Governor of New York, Pataki was known as a moderate to Liberal Republican who cut taxes and was tough on crime, but who also supported gun control, environmental protection, gay rights, and abortion rights.\n\n\n\nUnder the Pataki Administration, New York's credit rating was increased three times by , a fact that he highlighted often before his critics. During his three terms in office, he introduced and approved more tax cuts than any of his predecessors. Following through on a campaign promise, Pataki led a push to cut both the individual and the corporate tax rates in New York. The state's infamously high income tax rates dropped by 20% on average, but an economic downturn following the attacks of September 11 and increasing state spending caused  and  to coordinate an effort to roll back a number of these cuts in 2003 over Pataki's veto power.\n\nThe STAR and STAR-Plus programs were also introduced during Pataki's governorship. The STAR program introduced tax relief for New York's homeowners and landowners on their school taxes. The STAR-Plus program was later introduced when relief was diminished by increasing school taxes, increasing spending and State Aid. In his third term Pataki challenged the Speaker of the Assembly, resulting in two Court of Appeals decisions sustaining the powers of the governor to formulate a statewide budget.\n\n\n]]\nPataki advocated for Native American casinos in upstate New York. As a part of the creation of the Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls, an agreement was reached to give a percentage of the  revenue to the City of Niagara Falls each year to spend on local tourism projects and projects relating to hosting the casino.\n\n\n\nPataki describes himself as . In 1999, he called upon the Republican Party to soften its platform language regarding opposition to abortion rights.\n\n\nPataki lobbied heavily in favor of the , a  bill that had languished in the state Senate for many years due to the opposition of Senate Leader . In late 2002, Bruno finally gave in; the bill passed the Senate and was signed into law by Pataki. He opposed  as governor.\n\n\nPolls showed that the majority of New Yorkers wanted the state's death penalty laws restored. Prior to Pataki's tenure, a bill to restore the death penalty had passed the Legislature for several years in a row only to be vetoed by . Pataki made the issue a top priority of his, and when the bill reached his desk in 1995, he signed it into law. The  later ruled the death penalty law unconstitutional in a 4–3 decision in  (2004).\n\nBeing tough on crime was a major plank of Pataki's campaign for governor. In 2011, the administration touted statistics that illustrated that crime had steadily reduced during the 12 years Pataki had been governor, bringing New York from the 6th most dangerous state in the nation to the 7th safest. During his time in office, he signed into law over 100 new bills to change New York's criminal statutes. In 2000, Pataki helped lead the legislature in passing some of the then-strictest  laws in the country. Numerous aspects of the bill had been put forward by members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly but had never made it through the Republican held Senate. With numerous mass shootings in recent public memory, he urged a number of Republican Senators to support the bill, eventually passing it in a bipartisan effort. His administration also launched programs such as SAF-T (Statewide Anti-Fugitive Teams) and the 100 Most Wanted. The initiatives were aimed at disseminating descriptions of criminals who were evading law enforcement officials to promote the ability of average citizens to help aid in their capture. Versions of  and  were integrated into New York's laws under the governor as well as a number of reforms to the . The changes to the Rockefeller laws were largely focused on inmates' ability to appeal for an early release from sentences that were passed on them under mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.\n\n\nUnder the Pataki Administration a number of new health care programs were created focusing on expanding care to the state's poorest citizens.\nIn 1999, Governor Pataki signed into law comprehensive health care legislation that provided health insurance coverage, under Family Health Plus, to lower income adults who do not have health insurance through their employers.\nChild Health plus greatly expanded coverage for poorer families with children under 19 who did not qualify for . By 2001, 530,000 children had been enrolled in the program. Family Health Plus would expand insurance coverage even further, offering free insurance to families and single adults who had too much income to be covered by Medicaid but could not afford insurance. Pataki also increased the affordability and availability of medication for seniors under New York's  program by lowering fees and expanding eligibility. New York's 2003 ban on smoking in public places was passed and signed into law under the Pataki administration in the hopes that it would promote better health in New York and reduce health care cost over time. Accessing his twelve years in office, ''The New York Times'' ran an editorial praising his work on health care.\n\n\n, September 7, 2002 (back row, left)]]\n\nIn 2005, '''' placed George Pataki among the 20 individuals it commended for their personal efforts to combat global warming, citing his Greenhouse Gas Task Force and efforts to increase New York's usage of renewable energies. In 1996, Pataki oversaw the creation and passage of the Clean Water/Clean Air Environmental Bond Act. The act put forth $1.75 billion for over 2,200 environmentally minded projects throughout the state. Projects were focused on improving drinking water quality, closing landfills, investing in recycling programs, cleaning up New York's polluted waterways, funding cleanup of  and clean-air projects. During his tenure, Pataki added over one million acres to the entirety of the protected open spaces of New York. He also worked to protect the drinking water of millions of New Yorkers through the Catskill Watershed Agreement. Through the agreement, the numerous small communities that surround the 19 reservoirs that provide drinking water for New York City received $1 billion in aid to assuage environmental issues and promote local development in return for accepting higher standards of environmental regulations to better protect the reservoirs. On Pataki's final day in office, '''' ran an editorial evaluating his twelve years as governor and praised his work on the environment.\n\n\nPataki heeded mounting desire to allow New York to join numerous other states in the growing movement for charter schools. In 1998, Pataki prevailed upon the Legislature to pass a charter school law by threatening to veto a legislative pay raise if the bill was not passed. Over the course of his terms in office, Pataki would expand the availability of charter schools in New York City and raise the state's cap on charter schools to 250.\n\nIn coordination with Mayor , Pataki pushed to begin disassembling the reputation of  system as a group of remedial schools. Starting in 1999, CUNY colleges would be required to drop their remedial courses over a 3-year period and restrict students who could not pass entry exams in an effort to deliver a higher quality college education through the city colleges. Pataki also put forth legislation that would lend mayors in New York's five largest cities greater control over their education systems. Through negotiations this authority was only awarded to the mayor of New York City as an attempt to overcome a system of school boards that many considered to be hampering efforts at reform.\n\n\nLooking over his tenure, ''The New York Times'' ran an editorial that criticized Pataki for the lack of tangible political reform and the consolidation of power under his watch.\n\n\n\n\nPataki's New York City office had moved out of the World Trade Center in the months before the , as the governor had pushed for privatization of the building.\n\nFollowing 9/11, Pataki and New York City Mayor  appointed the  to distribute nearly $10 billion in federal grants and to oversee the construction of a memorial. A symbolic cornerstone for the Freedom Tower with Pataki's name was laid on July 4, 2004, and after numerous design changes, construction commenced in May 2006. The memorial was completed in 2011.\n\n\n\n\nPataki's 1994 running mate for  was , an academic best known for her critique of the Clinton health care plan. McCaughey was selected because of her work on the Clinton health care plan. Pataki choose McCaughey over sofa bed heiress ; Castro was nominated for the U.S. Senate in 1994.\n\nIn April 1997, Pataki announced that he was dropping McCaughey from his 1998 reelection ticket. McCaughey became a Democrat and unsuccessfully sought the governorship in that party's 1998 primary. She was on the 1998 general election ballot as the nominee of the Liberal Party for governor.\n\n\n\nAfter dropping McCaughey Ross from his 1998 ticket, Pataki considered several replacement running mates. In the spring of 1998 he announced his choice of State Supreme Court Justice  for lieutenant governor. Donohue did not run to succeed Pataki in 2006. In December 2006, Pataki appointed Donohue to be a Judge of the .\n\n\n\n and Lloyd Stamy]]\nIn July 2000, Pataki's name surfaced on the short list to be the running mate for Republican presidential nominee , along with the names of Governor  of Michigan, Governor  of Pennsylvania, former Senator  of Missouri, and former U.S. Labor Secretary  of North Carolina. Bush eventually selected the man who was in charge of scouting vice presidential candidates, former Secretary of Defense . Pataki had strongly campaigned for Bush, making an unsuccessful effort to keep  off the New York primary ballot (which Bush ultimately won).\n\n\nPataki and New York  Chairman  faced controversy after naming moderate   the party's nominee for the  against Senator  over conservative , who held significant advantages in both fundraising and organization.. ''Albany Times-Union'', February 25, 2004. Benjamin publicly accused Treadwell and Pataki of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process. Mills went on to lose the election in the largest landslide for a Senate seat in the history of New York.\n\n\nPataki was instrumental in bringing the  to  in . New York City, which normally votes overwhelmingly Democratic (the Democratic presidential nominees carried 78 percent of the city vote in both 2000 and 2004), had never hosted a Republican Convention. He introduced President . A year prior, Pataki had boasted Bush would carry the state in the 2004 elections; Bush lost New York 58–40 to . Pataki notably orated, referencing the recently deceased , \"This fall, we're going to win one for the Gipper. But our opponents, they're going to lose one with the Flipper.\"\n\n\nAfter leaving the governorship, Pataki joined the law firm  in New York joining their renewable energy practice. He continued to flirt with a possible bid for president. After ruling out a presidential campaign, Pataki retained his , which he could legally use to further his own views and other political interests. In addition, Pataki has formed an environmental consulting firm with his former chief of staff John Cahill, the Pataki-Cahill Group.\n\nPataki holds an  license.\n\n\nThe Governor George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center, located in , is designed to educate schoolchildren on government using Governor Pataki's public service as an example. , Pataki's former  chief, led the effort to create the center. On August 14, 2008, the '''' announced that the center's sponsors had \"filed paperwork with the State Department of Education and are trying to raise $500,000 for a start-up fund so they can open the center in the fall.\" The center held Governor Pataki's official portrait, which was moved to  at the end of 2009. As of 2008, the center had three directors: David Catalfamo, the governor's former communications chief; Kimberly Cappelleri, Libby Pataki's former chief of staff; and, Amy Holden, former executive assistant to the governor.\n\n\n\nIn February 2009, Pataki was approached by Sen. , head of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, about a possible 2010 run for the U.S. Senate seat to which  had been appointed. In April 2010, Pataki said he would not run against Gillibrand.\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2009, Pataki traveled to , sparking speculation. Ending months of speculation, Pataki announced on August 26, 2011, that he would not run for the Republican presidential nomination. He endorsed Mitt Romney.\n\n\nPataki announced in April 2010 that he was creating a nonprofit organization, Revere America, that would advocate repeal of the recently enacted United States , which he said was a \"horrific\" and costly bungle.

He had previously considered running in 2008 and in , but had decided against it.\n\nPataki's candidacy was considered a long-shot because of his age, because he had not run for office since 2002, and because of his liberal stances on abortion, gun control and environmental protection. Pataki received the endorsements of two New Hampshire State Senators:  and .\n\nPataki's run failed to gain traction. He failed to make the main stage in the candidate debates, being . His national poll numbers . Pataki did not file to be on the primary ballot in multiple states and missed the filing deadlines for Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. On December 29, 2015, Pataki ended his campaign before the Republican presidential primaries had begun. He endorsed Florida Senator  on January 26, 2016 and went on to endorse Ohio Governor  after Rubio suspended his campaign.\n\nAfter video footage of eventual nominee   emerged on October 7, 2016, Pataki described the Republican nominee's candidacy as \"a poisonous mix of bigotry & ignorance.\" Pataki also called upon Trump to step down as the Republican nominee.\n\n\nIn 2020, he declined to endorse  for re-election.

As of July 2023, Scaturro is president of the Grant Monument Association.\n\n\nScaturro was born in New York City in 1972. His family moved to New Hyde Park in Nassau County on Long Island the following year. His father, Salvatore, emigrated from Italy as a boy and was self-employed in a small business fixing air conditioning and refrigeration systems. His mother, Rosanne, worked near home as a legal secretary. Scaturro attended Notre Dame Elementary School in New Hyde Park and graduated with the school's highest honor. He then attended  in  where he graduated near the top of his class. He was active in scouting and attained the rank of .\n\n\n\nScaturro attended  and graduated , magna cum laude, in 1994 with an A.B. in history and political science. He won Columbia's Albert Marion Elsberg Prize for achievement in modern history. He then attended , receiving his  in 1997, winning the Fred G. Leebron Memorial Prize for the top paper in constitutional law. He was articles editor for the ''''.\n\n\n\nScaturro worked several years at two large commercial law firms headquartered in New York City, Lane & Mittendorf LLP (now ) and later,  LLP. In 2005, he became counsel for the Constitution on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee assisting the Committee Chairman,  (R- PA),  (R-AL, Ranking Member), and other Republican members of the committee. Scaturro's work focused on constitutional aspects of legislation and judicial and executive nominations. Among these, he assisted committee Republicans on the nominations of , , and  to the U.S. Supreme Court, and  and  to become U.S. Attorney General.\n\nIn 2010, Scaturro returned home to Long Island and became a visiting Assistant Professor at , where he taught courses on the legislative process and constitutional law. He is currently a partner at , where he handles civil rights and commercial litigation.\n\n\n\nScaturro published several books and articles about history and law, including ''President Grant Reconsidered'' (1998) which triggered a broad scholarly reassessment of the Grant presidency; '''s Retreat from Reconstruction'' (2000), an exploration of a key chapter in the history of civil rights; ''Public Companies'' (2002), a book he co-authored about making public companies responsible following recent corporate scandals; and ''Never Give In: Battling Cancer in the Senate'' (2010), which documented Sen. Arlen Specter's cancer treatment while he was still in office. In 2023, Scaturro co-edited ''Grant at 200''. Scaturro is currently working on a book about the  dispute between the United States and Great Britain following the Civil War, and how the ensuing arbitration inspired international peacekeeping efforts in future generations.\n\n\n\nCivil War general and 18th U.S. President  died in 1885 and was interred in New York City's Riverside Park.  is the largest mausoleum in the Western Hemisphere and was once among the nation's most widely visited tourist attractions. By the 1990s, however, the site had fallen into a severe state of disrepair. The tomb was scarred by graffiti. The roof leaked, the granite was cracked, and the area was used by the homeless as a latrine and drug haven. Scaturro regarded the desecration of Grant's Tomb as a national disgrace.\n\nThe tomb was administered by the , part of the . Scaturro volunteered with the Park Service to conduct guided tours at the site while he was a  undergraduate. He alerted Park Service officials that the tomb urgently needed repair, but to no avail. Scaturro persisted with regular memoranda to Park Service bureaucrats, including a 26-page report submitted in the summer of 1992. For over two years, Park Service officials simply ignored him. Undeterred, Scaturro went public with a 325-page whistleblowing report he sent to Congress and the President. His efforts drew national media attention, including a 1994 '''' editorial entitled \"Dishonor for a Hero President\" which said, \"the tomb's lamentable condition demands more funds from Washington.\" Scaturro also sued the Interior Department and National Park Service in federal court to force it to fulfill its legal duties to the public. His efforts paid off. Congress tripled the site's operations budget, including funds for security during off hours when the site was closed, and appropriated $1.8&nbsp;million for a full restoration. Scaturro explained to reporters, \"I only did what I did because I had no other resort ... the only thing left was abandoning the site, and that was not an alternative to me.\" Restoration was completed by April 27, 1997, the 100th anniversary of the site's dedication and Grant's 175th birthday. It was re-dedicated that day. Grant's descendants, appalled by the prior condition of the tomb, hailed Scaturro as a hero.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Scaturro made his first bid for the Republican nomination to represent  in . After Scaturro gained momentum to defeat the Democratic incumbent, , the chairman of Nassau County's notorious Republican machine, , hand-picked a machine stalwart, Nassau County legislator, , to defeat Scaturro. Nationally syndicated columnist  opined that Mondello preferred to \"boot an election in order to maintain his own personal power.\"\n\nIn a three-way primary, Becker won with 11,194 votes to Scaturro's 8,241 and Dan Maloney's 3,192. McCarthy beat Becker in the general election 94,483 votes to 81,718.\n\n\nA federal court unexpectedly ordered the primary for Congress take place on June 26, yielding a very low turnout. With only 7% of registered Republicans voting, Becker narrowly won the primary with 6,836 votes to Scaturro's 5,531. Nonetheless, Scaturro won the Conservative Party primary by a write-in votea first in the modern history of  for an electoral district that size. In the general election, Scaturro won 15,603 votes on the Conservative line, despite the absence of a get-out-the-vote drive, the effects of , and a national Democratic wave. Scaturro's success on a minor party line was greater than that of any congressional candidate in the 4th District since 1986. He also received over 40% more votes within the district on the Conservative Party line than Republican-Conservative presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, and U.S. Senate candidate, Wendy Long.\n\n\nOn October 21, 2013, Scaturro announced he would run again to challenge Congresswoman  to represent New York's 4th Congressional District. News media reported McCarthy, a nurse and lifelong smoker, was suffering from lung cancer, and on January 8, 2014, she announced that she would not seek reelection. Democrats then announced their bid to win this open \"purple\" seat. Syndicated columnist  wrote that Scaturro \"has a serious chance to win the Republican as well as Conservative nomination this year... [in what] could be a much more seriously contested seat than it was [in 2012].\"\n\nOn January 29, 2014, Democrat and Nassau County District Attorney, , announced she would run for the 4th District seat. It was reported she would face a primary contest from Nassau County legislator Kevan Abrahams. Rice was endorsed by nine-term incumbent McCarthy. As of the January 31, 2014, FEC filing deadline, Scaturro was the only Republican candidate to have raised money, with over $113,000 cash on hand.\nThe Nassau County Republican Committee and the Conservative Party both nominated  to face Rice but Scaturro primaried Blakeman and lost badly. Blakeman beat Scaturro in every town and won by over 30 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n* Facebook|publisher=facebook.com|access-date=March 16, 2014}}\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Grimm reportedly admitted in an interview with the ''Staten Island Advance'' that his former restaurant in Manhattan, Healthalicious, had been on the verge of bankruptcy, forcing him to sell his stake in it. A major difference between the two candidates was the issue of the U.S. economic stimulus package, which the ''Advance'' called the \"starkest contrast\" among the two candidates. Grimm stated that the stimulus was a \"huge waste\" of taxpayer money and ineffective in generating job creation and economic recovery, whereas McMahon cited improvements in the state budget and renovations on the Staten Island Expressway and the Saint George Ferry Terminal as direct successes of the stimulus.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Grimm defeated McMahon in the race, 51% to 48%.

Three of Pinto's followers reportedly said that Grimm or Ofer Biton, a top aide of Pinto's, had told them that the campaign would find a way to accept donations that were over the legal limit.

Under New York City's Department of Environmental Protection rules, all homeowners are subject to a minimum charge of $1.19 per day, even if a home uses no water during a given period.

Grimm then threatened Scotto, saying that he would \"break [Scotto] in half,\" as well as threatening to throw Scotto over the balcony.\n\nGrimm issued a statement defending his behavior, saying that he was annoyed by what he called a \"disrespectful cheap shot\" from Scotto. The next day, Grimm contacted Scotto to offer an apology for his behavior, which Scotto deemed sincere. Grimm also issued a written apology, saying, \"I shouldn't have allowed my emotions to get the better of me and lose my cool.\" An unnamed former staffer for Grimm and NY1-TV political director Bob Hardt reported that Grimm had behaved in a similar manner to other reporters on previous occasions.\n\n\nIn early 2014, Grimm and  cosponsored the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. In March 2014, the bill was passed by the U.S. Senate and signed into law by President Obama. The law repealed exponential increases in flood-insurance rates for homeowners in flood-prone areas, preventing \"skyrocketing\" flood insurance premiums for 5.5 million Americans.\n\n\nAccording to '''', in April 2014, Grimm became \"the first sitting House Republican to stop denying the science that humans cause climate change.\" Grimm stated, \"The majority of respected scientists say that it's conclusive, the evidence is clear.

In November 2012, the  decided to inquire into the campaign but agreed to \"defer consideration\" of it at the Department of Justice's request.\n\nOn January 10, 2014, the FBI arrested Grimm's former girlfriend Diana Durand on charges that she had illegally donated more than $10,000 to Grimm's 2010 campaign. Durand allegedly gave the campaign $4,800, the legal limit, but then used s to donate more than $10,000 illegally. The FBI also charged Durand with lying to federal agents about the matter. Grimm denied any wrongdoing. In September 2014, Durand pled guilty to making illegal contributions to Grimm's 2010 campaign.\n\nThe investigation, which originally focused on Grimm's 2010 fundraising, branched out to include Grimm's prior business dealings. On April 25, 2014, Grimm's attorney was advised by the U.S. Attorney's office that his client would be indicted on criminal charges related to Healthalicious. On April 28, prosecutors unsealed a 20-count indictment charging that Grimm and others concealed over $1 million  of the restaurant's sales and wages from both the U.S. federal government and the State of New York. Grimm surrendered to the FBI that morning. Grimm pled not guilty to all charges and was released on $400,000 bond. He told reporters that he not only had every intention of fighting the charges, but also of staying in office and running for a third term.\n\nOn December 23, 2014, under two months after winning reelection, Grimm pled guilty to one charge of felony tax evasion. He admitted to under-reporting Healthalicious's revenues by over $900,000 over four years and to filing false tax returns based on that under-reported income. He also admitted to using the under-reported receipts to pay restaurant expenses, as well as to make under-the-table cash payments to employees. As part of the plea bargain, the other charges were dropped, but Grimm admitted to two of the offenses in the original indictment: knowingly employing people ineligible to work in the United States and lying in a 2013 deposition. The crimes to which he pled guilty carried a prison sentence of up to 30 months.\n\nAt first Grimm admitted making mistakes, but told a reporter he would \"absolutely not\" resign. But on December 29, 2014, it was reported that after discussing the matter with House Speaker , Grimm had changed his mind and would decline to take his seat for a third term. He resigned from Congress on January 5, 2015. A  to replace him was held on May 5, 2015, and Staten Island District Attorney , a Republican, was elected to the seat.\n\nOn July 17, 2015, U.S. District Judge  suggested that Grimm's moral compass \"needs some reorientation\" and sentenced him to eight months in prison. He surrendered on September 22, 2015, after a brief delay for medical treatment. He was released on May 20, 2016, after serving seven months.\n\n\nPrior to his indictment, Grimm lived on .

He was the former chairman of the  and member of the  from the 43rd Assembly District in Central , which includes  and parts of  and .\n\nHe was convicted of three  counts of accepting illegal s during his 2000 and 2002 re-election campaigns for his seat in the New York State Assembly and served time in prison.\n\n\n\nNorman was one of five children of the Rev. Clarence Norman Sr., a politically influential head pastor of the First Baptist Church of , and his wife, Ellen.\n\n\n\nAfter earning degrees from  and St. John's School of Law he entered politics, first serving as general counsel to the  Subcommittee on Probation and Parole. He later served in the Kings County District Attorney's office for five years as an Assistant District Attorney in the felony bureau.\n\n\nIn November 1982, Norman was elected to the New York State Assembly for the first time, representing the 43rd District in Central , which included  and parts of  and . He was a member of the Assembly from 1983 to 2005, sitting in the , , , , , , , , , ,  and s.\n\nAfter being re-elected easily from an overwhelmingly Democratic district several times, the first major challenge to Norman's political power base in Brooklyn came in 1998, when  officer, minister, and future City Councilman  ran against him in a Democratic primary. Although Norman was victorious in that race, he was re-elected by only 580 votes, a relatively slim margin of 55% to 45%, which signaled the first chinks in his previously impregnable political armor.\n\n\nHe served as District Leader from 1986 to 1993. In 1990, Norman became the first African-American, and the youngest Democrat, to be elected as chairman of the Executive Committee of the Kings County Democratic County Committee. Heading the largest county Democratic organization in the country, Norman became an influential power broker, on municipal, statewide, and national levels.\n\nIn addition to being a member of the Assembly for 23 years, and head of the Kings County Democratic Party for 15, Norman also held other positions within the city, state, and national Democratic Party, including being a delegate to the  in 2000 and 2004, a Presidential Elector from New York in 2000, a member of the  from New York in 2004, and Assistant Majority Leader of the New York State Assembly beginning in 2001.\n\n\n\nThe investigation into Norman's campaign practices stemmed from an inquiry in 2003 by Kings County District Attorney  that originally targeted judicial corruption and veered into numerous allegations of judgeships in Kings County being sold to wealthy campaign donors within the Democratic Party.\n\nA Brooklyn judge, , was accused of bribery by taking money from an attorney to rig the outcome of divorce and child custody cases that he was hearing. He informed investigators that he was aware of a much broader scheme whereby prospective candidates purchased their seats on the bench. In an attempt to secure evidence to support his allegation and to reduce his sentence, Garson agreed to go undercover to capture Norman and others on tape. The judge wore a wire for nearly a year without obtaining incriminating evidence against Norman.\n\nWhile Garson's bribery case was under way, a report appeared in the '''' that a former Brooklyn judge allegedly was asked to pay more than $100,000 to stay on the bench - and then lost her seat after she refused. “Congressman  and a lawyer who handled his election matters in 2000, Bernard \"Mitch\" Alter, allegedly asked Judge Maxine Archer for $160,000.” When approached, Alter did not deny the claim, but stated that it was $140,000 for campaign expenses. Alter confirmed that he submitted an estimate requesting $56,000 for petitioning, mailing and Election Day operations, plus $54,000 in consulting fees. The Post went on to say, ''\"the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office was interested in speaking with Archer as part of an ongoing grand jury probe into the reported sales of judgeships in Kings County.\"''\n\nNothing came of the allegations made against Alter and Congressman Towns. When it was heard that Hynes was dropping the investigation against Norman, two female judges, Karen Yellen and Marcia Sikowitz, angered about the results of their 2001 campaigns, complained to Hynes that Norman told them to come up with $100,000 or lose the party nod. The implication was that Norman had bullied them into using a preferred printer and extorting money from them. The complaints caused Hynes' office to shift from investigating judicial corruption to concentrating on the sale of judgeships. Hynes eventually narrowed his investigation to Norman's campaign practices.\n\nIn April 2003, Hynes alleged that the system through which candidates for New York State Supreme Court judgeships were selected was not democratic, and essentially involved an exchange of seats in return for campaign contributions to prominent Democratic Party officeholders and power brokers.\n\n\nOn October 9, 2003, Norman was indicted on charges of misappropriating campaign funds and improperly claiming more than $5,000 in travel expenses that were reimbursed by taxpayers. Norman said that Hynes's inquiry was a result of a failed investigation into other areas and that he had no plans to resign from his county Democratic post or his Assembly seat. However, several weeks later, an additional indictment with charges regarding the sale of the judgeships in Kings County was filed against Norman.\n\n\nAfter several of the charges were dropped and numerous delays, Norman went to trial, and was convicted of two felony counts of violating New York State campaign laws by soliciting illegal contributions in his 2000 and 2002 primary campaigns, and one felony and one misdemeanor count of  of those contributions.\n\nOn trial for a second set of charges several months later, Norman was convicted again, this time on larceny for putting a $5,000 check made out to his assembly campaign into a personal account. He was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years for the convictions in both trials.\n\n\nThere were still several remaining charges. On March 24, 2006, Norman was acquitted of stealing over $5,000 by claiming reimbursement for travel expenses between the state capital (Albany) and Brooklyn, which involved a motor vehicle that the Kings County Democratic Party had paid for. This was his first acquittal in three trials.\n\n\nNorman still faced prosecution on a fourth charge from the initial investigation - accusations of extortion involving prospective judicial candidates. On February 23, 2007, Norman was convicted for the third time in his four criminal trials, this time for grand larceny and extortion. Prosecutors said he had coerced the two women candidates for civil court judge to pay thousands of dollars to certain campaign consultants and a specific printer of campaign materials with ties to Norman, or lose the Democratic party support in the 2002 primary. He was acquitted on five other counts of the original indictment. He was sentenced to 1 to 3 years on this charge, to be served after the first sentence.\n\n\nAs a result of his convictions, Norman was forced to resign as chairman of the Kings County Democratic Party, was expelled from the New York State Assembly, and was disbarred. He began serving prison time on June 5, 2007, and was released to the Division of Parole from Manhattan's  on March 14, 2011. He was discharged from parole one year later.\n\nDespite his criminal convictions, Norman still collects an annual pension of $43,000 from New York State.\n\n\nAfter his conviction, a special election was held to determine Norman's successor as Assemblyman. , a member of the church where Clarence Norman Sr. was pastor, won overwhelmingly, defeating two opponents, one of whom was the brother of former City Councilman and Norman rival .\n\nAssemblyman  eventually replaced Norman as leader of the Kings County Democratic Party.

Felder has been elected to multiple offices as a , but is known for having caucused with the s during the early part of his New York State Senate tenure. Prior to serving in the State Senate, Felder represented the  in the .\n\n\nEarly in his career, Felder served as  to   member .\n\n\nFelder was elected to the New York City Council in District 44 in 2001. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009.\n \nDuring his tenure on the City Council, Felder gained popularity among his conservative Jewish constituents for advocating strongly on their behalf and for supporting . Although personally opposed to  as being against Orthodox Judaism, he backed  for City Council Speaker in what was seen as a political move to gain allies. Although Felder claimed to support Quinn, he said he could not actually vote for her because of religious reasons. When the time came to vote Quinn for Council Speaker, Felder did not cast a vote and took a trip to the restroom. Unlike nearly all other New York Democrats, Felder is a staunch opponent of .\n\nFelder backed city funding for religious schools, while maintaining that he opposes displays of religion in public schools. Felder has also gained attention by calling for better labeling of  content in foods and beverages, as well as a ban on the distribution of unsolicited fliers. Felder is perhaps best known for his attempt to ban the feeding of pigeons in New York City.\n\nIn 2005, Felder crossed party lines to endorse then-  in his bid for reelection as New York City mayor. Felder\nasserted that Bloomberg was the only Republican he had ever voted for and implied that Bloomberg would be the only Republican he would ever support.\n\nFelder was Chair of the Council's Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Siting, and Maritime uses in his first term. In January 2006, he became Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations. As Chair of Governmental Operations, Felder supported Mayor Bloomberg's plan to curb  contracting practices and the Mayor's bid to extend term limits so the Mayor could run for a third term.\n\nThe committee also provided oversight of the City Board of Elections' implementation of the  and enacted legislation to transfer the Environmental Control Board from the Department of Environmental Protection to the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. The Committee also enacted legislation to extend term limits from two terms to three. As a member of the Council's Land Use Committee, Felder was part of a group of New York state legislators that has consistently blocked plans to renovate , calling the UN anti-American and anti-Israel. In spite of such calls, the UN announced in 2007 that it would undergo a $1 billion makeover.\n\nIn April 2006, Felder accused the highest-ranking uniformed member of the , Chief , of using inappropriate language when Esposito attempted to quell individuals who entered a  house during a riot in . Felder indicated that he personally heard the chief say, \"Get the fucking Jews out of here.\" The , which investigates police misconduct, later found the accusation against Esposito unsubstantiated, but did reprimand Chief Esposito for using profanity. When subsequently asked to comment on the Review Board's finding, Felder's office stated that Felder had \"no comment\" about the incident and that he \"wants to put the matter behind him\".\n\nFelder announced his Democratic presidential primary election vote for Senator  \"in protest\" for what he felt was bad behavior by the campaign of New York Senator , following comments made by former president  regarding the South Carolina primary.\n\n\nFelder served under   as Deputy  for Budget and Accounting from 2010 through 2012.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Felder challenged incumbent State Senator  in a Democratic primary in Senate District 21. Parker won the primary with less than 50% of the vote.\n\nFelder was elected to the  in  in November 2012. The district had been reconfigured as a \"Super Jewish\" district; reportedly, the Republican-controlled chamber drew the district specifically with Felder in mind. Even though incumbent David Storobin had won the seat in a special election, the GOP offered little support to him, and Felder handily defeated him.\n\nFollowing the election to the Senate, Felder announced that despite being elected as a Democrat, he intended to caucus with the s. That decision, along with Felder's stated willingness to return to the Senate Democratic Conference if doing so would benefit his district, had attracted attention and speculation during his Senate tenure. Brooklyn Democratic Party Chairman  called Felder's defection a \"disgrace and a complete betrayal of his constituents.\"\n\nAs a State Senator, Felder was the only Democrat to vote against the $15 minimum wage; he cast deciding votes against the immigration-friendly , killing it; he stated that ending  was a mistake; he torpedoed the 5-cent plastic bag fees, thus winning himself the 2016 \"Oil Slick Award\" from an environmental advocacy group; and he supported pro-Israel policies like  and Iran divestment. On the final day of the 2013 legislative session, Felder voted against a hostile amendment that would have attached a pro-choice bill to an unrelated piece of legislation.\n\nFelder was reelected to the Senate without opposition in 2014 and 2016. In the latter election, he ran on the Democratic, Republican, and  lines.\n\nIn April 2018, other lawmakers accused Felder of \"essentially holding the $168 billion budget hostage until the state agreed not to interfere with the curriculum at the private Jewish schools known as yeshivas.\"\n\nAfter an April 2018 agreement returned the  (a breakaway faction of Democrats) to the mainline Democratic conference, Felder became the swing vote in the State Senate; this placed a spotlight on his continued affiliation with Senate Republicans. On April 24, 2018, Felder announced that he intended to continue caucusing with Senate Republicans during the remaining weeks of the 2018 legislative session; Felder made this statement despite the possibility that two special elections being held that day could give the Democratic Party a numerical majority in the State Senate, and despite Governor 's public support for Democratic control of the Senate. On April 25, Cuomo sent Felder an open letter to pressure him to rejoin the Senate Democratic Conference. Felder continued to caucus with the Republicans.\n\nAccording to a May 2018 article in the '''', Brooklyn insiders believed that Felder would not be swayed by pressure, and that the Democratic establishment did not understand the \"transactional\" approach most of Felder's  constituents take to politics. Several people familiar with the district's dynamics told the ''Times-Union'' that most of Felder's constituents wear their party registration very loosely. According to one of them,  of Jewish Insider, the area's voters mostly register as Democrats in order to have a say in local elections, but prefer Republicans at the state level. On paper, Felder's district is one of the more conservative districts in New York City.  carried it with 52.8 percent of the vote in 2016, and  carried it with 58.3 percent in 2012. In both cases, only the -based  gave a higher vote percentage to a Republican presidential candidate.\n\nIn June 2018, Democratic State Committee members approved an informal resolution recommending Felder's ouster from the party. Former state Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, speaking to reporters afterward, reiterated their exasperation with Felder: \n\n\nIn the 2018 Democratic primary in September 2018, Felder defeated Blake Morris, a lawyer. Morris was endorsed by Brooklyn Progressive Action Network, the labor union SEIU 32BJ, and the progressive group . Felder won re-election on November 6, 2018.\n\nThe 2018 elections saw the Democrats win control of the State Senate for only the second time since . Felder sought to rejoin the Senate Democratic Conference. However, on December 31, 2018, the Senate Democratic Conference announced that Felder would not be allowed to rejoin its ranks. Even without Felder, the Democrats had 39 Senate seats, seven more than the 32 needed for a majority. On January 9, 2019, the '''' reported that Felder had decided against caucusing with the Republicans, and was looking forward to rejoining the Senate Democrats \"'at the appropriate time'\". Felder was accepted into the Democratic caucus July 1, 2019 after having voted with the Democrats on multiple major pieces of legislation.\n\n\nFelder's father was Rabbi Harry Felder, spiritual leader of Beth Aaron Congregation in Borough Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n*  Facebook Group\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Earlier, on June 11, 2008, McMahon had been endorsed by the city's 12 Democratic congressmen.\n\nThe 13th had long been considered to be the most conservative district of the 13 that divided New York City. It was based in Staten Island, which is the base of the city's Republican Party. Although Democrats have a 17-point edge in registration, its voters are somewhat conservative on social issues and matters regarding , which kept Republicans in the seat for over a quarter century. However, the Republicans had considerable difficulty finding a replacement for Fossella on the ballot, eventually settling on former state assemblyman . As a result, nearly all major pundits believed McMahon was almost certain to win the seat.  \n on February 4, 2009]]\nIn the November election, McMahon won in a landslide, taking 61 percent of the vote to Straniere's 33 percent.  With his victory, New York City's congressional delegation became entirely Democratic for the first time in 76 years. This occurred despite the fact that  narrowly carried Staten Island in the presidential election; a Democratic presidential candidate has carried Staten Island only four times since 1936.\n\n\n\nMcMahon was challenged by Republican and Conservative Party nominee , a former FBI Special Agent, and Libertarian nominee Tom Vendittelli.

He has two children from a previous marriage.\n\n\nSoares worked his way through  as an intern for the  Authority, and later for the  's office. He also worked with the Albany Law School  law clinic for prisoners' legal services. Upon graduation, he was hired as an assistant district attorney by then-DA Sol Greenberg.\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2004, Soares was elected as Albany County District Attorney.Michael Cooper, \"Democrats Gain Seats, but G.O.P. Retains Senate and Most Incumbents Win,\" ''The New York Times'', November 3, 2004, found at . Retrieved January 30, 2009.

This prediction, however, failed to materialize when Soares won by a landslide. Soares' campaign received third-party support from the progressive, union-backed Working Families Party, which viewed Soares' victory as a sign of its own influence and of a mandate for reform of New York's Rockefeller drug sentencing laws (which were opposed by Soares, but supported by Clyne). Michael Slackman of The New York Times stated that the Party had \"established itself as an emerging political force statewide by getting a little-known candidate elected district attorney in Albany County.\" Soares' victory was called one of the \"most stunning upsets in New York political history.\" '''' noted the unusual nature of that upset the day that almost all s won easy re-election.\n\n\nFormer DA Clyne, who lost to current DA Soares by a landslide in the 2004 Democratic primaries, initially contemplated opposing his successor for re-election; but eventually he decided not to run. For a moment it looked as though Soares might run unopposed since no candidate from either major parties, Democratic or Republican, had filed to run for the office of District Attorney of Albany County before the deadline to file expired. However, since there was still time left for independent candidates to file, Roger Cusick, a Republican, who had opposed DA Soares in 2004 and lost, declared himself as an independent candidate on August 18, one day before the deadline to file as an independent candidate would have expired. Cusick was able to get enough signatures to put himself in the ballot list. He once again opposed DA Soares in the November 2008 election.\n\nIn November 2008, Soares won re-election by a landslide, 73% to 27%, with a 50,000 vote margin.\n\n'''November 2008 election for district attorney'''\n* P. David Soares (D), 80,441 votes, or 73%\n* Roger J.

There were 29,526 blank votes.\n\n\nAttorney Lee Kindlon announced his plans to challenge Soares in a Democratic Party primary in 2012. Soares was endorsed for re-election by the ''Albany Times Union''.\n\nSoares won the primary on September 13, 2012, by an unofficial count of 14,498 to 10,1432.\n\n\nSoares was defeated in a Democratic primary by criminal defense attorney Lee Kindlon, who had unsuccessfully challenged him 12 years earlier, by a margin of 55-45%.  Soares is said to be mulling a write-in campaign.\n\n\nThere was speculation in early 2007 in the local and national media that Soares might run for re-election as District Attorney, or for higher office, in 2008.\n\nSoares was featured in '''', in which interview he discussed his goals and hopes for his career. On October 26, 2007, Soares was mentioned in the largest local daily newspaper as a possible replacement for   in the 2008 race for Congress in the 21st congressional district of New York. However, Soares opted to run for re-election in 2008 instead.Robert Gavin, \"Soares unfazed by critics: Amid Troopergate probe, DA says he's not worried about re-election, '''', April 1, 2008, found at . Accessed April 1, 2008.\n\n\nSoares has faced some criticism. His  position has been disputed by at least one defense lawyer, while some members of Albany police and others consider Soares as \"soft\" on drug crimes. He has been criticized for his prosecution of defendants from  for selling steroids to residents of Albany County.\n\nSome feel the criticism is politically motivated, and his supporters and independent pundits applaud Soares's progressive approach to criminal prosecution in Albany County. In an editorial, the Times Union noted, \"Mr. Soares has rightly concluded that it would serve no purpose to seek a perjury indictment of Mr. Spitzer because the former governor did not speak with the district attorney's office under oath.\" Soares claims to be \"unfazed by critics.\"\n\nIn 2011, Soares was criticized by members of both major parties for declining to prosecute participants in the Occupy Albany demonstrations who were arrested for violating a curfew in Albany's Academy Park. During an interview with Keith Olbermann, Soares called Occupy Albany a \"wonderful protest,\" and stated that \"we would decline to prosecute any of the cases, any of the arrests, based upon the fact that unless there were injuries to police officers or damages to property, then the people should be allowed to exercise their First Amendment right.\" Albany County Republican Party Chairman Don Clarey described Soares' decision not to prosecute as being \"politically motivated,\" while attorney Lee Kindlon, who lost a challenge to Soares in a Democratic primary in 2012, accused Soares of violating his oath of office. Soares beat Kindlon handily in a primary that year, illustrating that Kindlon's argument did not negatively influence voters in the least.  In addition, the Working Families Party circulated a petition supporting Soares' decision not to prosecute the Occupy protesters.\n\nSoares received criticism from one Albany County official for arguing back vacation pay to an assistant district attorney whom he had dismissed. Michael Conners, County Comptroller, noted his supposed , since Soares had received his past due pay when Clyne had fired him. Soares distinguished the two cases, because he fired the ADA for cause, while he had been fired for running against his boss.\n\n\nSoares has received several public service awards during his tenure as District Attorney, including being named a 2015 \"America's Top 10 Animal Defender\" by the Animal Legal Defense Fund, and the Whitney M. Young Community Partner of the Year Award in 2014 for hosting HIV/AIDS testing at the office's Community Justice and Outreach Center in Albany.\n\nAs of 2016, Soares serves as the 1st Vice President of the  (DAASNY)  and is a Board of Directors at the New York State Prosecutors Training Institute. Soares served as President of DAASNY from July 2018 through July 2019.\n\n\n\nSoares' office's first big case was the murder case of Peter Porco, an attorney, in 2005. ADA Michael McDermott and ADA David Rossi secured a guilty verdict for the murder against Porco's son,  after a change of venue moved the case to Orange County, NY. Christopher Porco was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison. In October 2011, the New York Court of Appeals upheld Porco's conviction. The case was profiled by several media outlets, including the Lifetime TV Network's rendition entitled \"Romeo Killer: The Chris Porco Story.\"\n\nOther notable cases handled by Soares' office include the double murder conviction of People vs. Edward Mero  and People vs. De Von Callicutt.\n\n\nIn October 2006, Soares opened an investigation into   on allegations of defrauding the government. On December 22, 2006, Hevesi accepted a plea bargain from Soares which called for Hevesi to plead guilty to one count of defrauding the government based on his personal use of state employees to care for his ailing wife, in lieu of a grand jury indictment.\n\nOn January 3, 2007, Soares said he would open investigations into wrongdoings in the New York state departments of Education, Health, Motor Vehicles, Labor and Insurance.\n\nSoares investigated the so-called  scandal in August and September 2007, and found that Governor  and his staff broke no laws. He re-opened his investigation amid much criticism.\n\n\nThe Free Press office under Soares has prosecuted several defendants for selling illegal s to  players, and representatives of the  met at least twice with Soares over this issue. Soares secured the conviction of a  who prescribed steroids to baseball players and other persons who the doctor had never examined.\n\n\nMedia reports in February 2024 revealed that Soares is under investigation for directing state grant monies received by his office to fund nearly $24,000 in bonuses for himself. Soares, who earns a salary of $208,000 per year, insisted his actions were legal but pledged in a video to return the money \"to change the conversation.\" New York State Assemblyman , a Democrat whose district includes Albany County, has called on Soares to resign. The controversy has threatened to derail Soares' reelection campaign. The Albany County Democratic Committee has yet to endorse Soares and is interviewing other candidates for the position, including Steck himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was a member of the , and chairman of the .\n\n\nVito Lopez was born on June 5, 1941, in , of an  family; his last name Lopez derives from his grandfather, who was a native of . He graduated from Brooklyn's , and received a  in Business Administration from  (1964), and a  from  (1970), where he was trained in the community organizing program.Marwell, Nicole P., ''Bargaining for Brooklyn: Community Organizations in the Entrepreneurial City'' (University of Chicago Press: 2007), pg. 102 (\"Marwell\"). Lopez had two children by his former wife, Joan.\n\nLopez was diagnosed with leukemia in 1993, and in 2010 was treated for a recurrence of cancer.  He died on November 9, 2015, at Sloan Kettering Memorial Hospital at the age of 74.\n\n\nLopez began his career with the New York City Department of Social Services, at the Stanhope Street Senior Center in , Brooklyn. Believing the neighborhood received little attention from City Hall and senior citizen programs there received even less in terms of program support, Lopez began organizing senior citizens there. His first attracted citywide attention by organizing in November 1981 an assembly of 100 senior citizens at  to protest what they saw as the \"serious neglect\" shown to them in programs for decent housing, nursing homes and medical facilities.\n\nLopez began researching the programs for senior citizens available from local, state and federal funding sources in order to supplement the relatively meager services offered at the Stanhope Street Senior Center. This led his to conceive the idea of creating a not-for-profit that would enter into government contracts to provide services for senior citizens, which he planned would focus on Bushwick and the neighboring Italian-American community of .\n\nIn 1973, he founded  (RBSCC), a non-profit organization to provide services to senior citizens in Bushwick and the adjoining (interborough) neighborhood of  as well as surrounding areas. The first contract it won was to manage the Stanhope Street Senior Center. The Council aggressively pursued government funds and promoted itself as the primary contact for citizens looking for government assistance, even assistance not within the purview of the Council's contracts.\n\nOver time as the Council increased in size and importance, Lopez used it to generate loyalty among constituents for which it provided services and to employ locals to create an administrative staff.Marwell, pg. 109. These two groups allowed Lopez to gain his political positions beginning with his Assembly seat in 1984. While he resigned as Executive Director of the Council on winning the seat, he remained closely associated with it and used his political clout on its behalf. At the height of his political influence the Council \"served as a de facto political machine for him and his allies ...\"\n\nAccording to the '','' by 2010 as Assemblyman Lopez had steered $430,000 in state grants to the Ridgewood-Bushwick Citizens Council. Accessed May 18, 2013 At that time, the Council had $100 million in state and city contracts to build affordable homes, provide meals to seniors and run after-school programs. The ''Daily News'' found that for the period 2007-2010 firms doing businesses with the Council (and their subcontractors) contributed $51,000 to election campaigns of Lopez or to the  of which Lopez was chairman.\n\n\nLopez was a member of the  (53rd D.) from 1985 to 2013, sitting in the , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  and s. His district comprised the Brooklyn neighborhoods of  and .\n\nFrom 2006-12, Lopez served as the chairman of the  Democratic Party, having replaced former chairman  On August 28, 2012, Lopez announced that he would not seek re-election as Brooklyn Democratic leader due to allegations that he sexual harassed two of his staffers. Lopez was forced to step down after it was revealed that he settled a lawsuit by two of his female staffers who alleged that he had  them. On May 17, 2013, Lopez also resigned from then his assembly seat effective at the end of the legislative session June 20, 2013. Several days later Lopez moved up his resignation date to May 20, 2013.\n\n\nLopez was among the sponsors of a bill to expand the original 1982 Loft Law, ''\"...which gave rights to illegal tenants and made their lofts subject to rent stabilization.\"'' , which went into effect June 2010, expanded these protections to lofts in manufacturing areas of Bushwick, , , and .\n\nWhile Lopez previously sponsored similar legislation, he did not support a 2009 bill, the Child Victims Act, sponsored by Assemblywoman . This bill would have opened a one-year window to allow older victims of prior  the ability to file civil actions against their abusers.\n\nHe has sponsored a competing bill that provides no window, but would change current law to allow lawsuits against public institutions without requiring a 90-day notice of claim. The ''New York Times'' reported on June 9, 2009, that in an effort to reach a compromise with Lopez's bill, Markey amended her bill to specifically include all public institutions through the waiver of the current 90-day notice of claim requirement, and also limited the window to victims aged 53 or younger.\n\nDuring an October 13, 2006, meeting with the Lambda Independent Democrats, a political club of gay Democrats in New York City, Lopez publicly declared his support for extending the right of civil marriage to same-sex couples for the first time in his political career. He also intimated that he would help to enact legislation that would recognize same-sex marriages, which the highest court in New York State had refused to recognize earlier that year.\n\n\nIn 2018  said that Lopez refused to support the Bloomberg administrator's rezoning of the Brooklyn waterfront unless the administration allocated a million dollars for a daycare center that Doctoroff thought Lopez's girlfriend was connected to. By Doctoroff's account, this happened the day before the city council vote; time was limited, and after midnight Doctoroff called the head of the agency that oversaw daycare centers, woke him up, and secured the million dollars for the center to meet Lopez's demand and pass the rezoning.\n\n\nAccording to multiple media accounts in September 2010, Lopez and the  Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council were the subject of several investigations, led by the US Attorney in Manhattan and in Brooklyn, and the New York City Department of Investigations.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2012, the New York State Assembly Standing Committee on Ethics and Guidance concluded an investigation, made in response to allegations brought forth by two young female staffers, and unanimously found that Vito Lopez had violated the Assembly’s sexual harassment/retaliation policy.\n\nBased on recommendations from the committee, Assembly Speaker  removed him as chair of the Committee on Housing, stripped him of all seniority, reduced his staff allotment and forbade him from employing any interns or persons under the age of 21. Silver also censured and admonished him on behalf of the Assembly. He was reelected in November 2012 despite token opposition, but was stripped of his Democratic chairmanship and had his pay cut.\n\nIn mid-May 2013 the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics issued a report which described in detail the behavior alleged by multiple women, which prompted prominent Democrats, including Governor  and Speaker Silver, to call for his immediate resignation. In response Lopez, citing a report by special prosecutor Staten Island District Attorney  that he would not bring criminal charges. On May 17, 2013, he announced he would resign from the Assembly at the end of his term in June 2013 and in the fall run for a seat on the .\n\nThis announcement brought further calls from his immediate resignation, including by Assembly Minority leader , and brought a vow by City Council Speaker , a Democrat running for Mayor, that she would work to prevent his election. That afternoon Speaker Silver released a draft resolution to expel Lopez from the Assembly that he said would be voted on when the Assembly returns on May 20, 2013.\n\n\nLopez resigned in May 2013 after a legislative ethics panel censured him. On June 11, 2013, Lopez was fined $330,000 who was accused of groping, intimidating and manipulating young female staffers in a 2012 scandal.\n\n\nLopez ran in the  to succeed  in the 34th district.

Among his siblings were brothers  (former president of ) and  (an entrepreneur who owned  and  in  and  in ).\n\n\nIn 1939, Carey enlisted in the  as a private in C Squadron, .

His awards include the , the  with , and the  with Silver Star. He was discharged in 1946 at the rank of colonel.\n\nHe received his B.A. from  in 1942. Following his military service, he enrolled at the institution's , where he earned his J.D. in 1951. He was admitted to the New York state bar that same year.\n\n\nCarey was a partner in the law firm of .\n\n\n\nIn 1960, running as a , Carey was elected to the  from a district generally centered around Brooklyn's ,  and  neighborhoods, unseating Republican incumbent . Carey's seven terms in office coincided with major demographic changes in his district, as exemplified by  and the decline of the Sunset Park waterfront's longstanding  businesses; the concomitant emergence of  in eastern Park Slope; the coalescence of a nascent  community in western Park Slope and Sunset Park; and the opening of Bay Ridge's  (which spurred migration by many  whites in his district to the more suburban borough of ) in 1964. Although he has been erroneously characterized as the first congressman to  (a stance actually taken by -based congressman ), he may have been the first member of the Brooklyn congressional delegation to speak out against the conflict following discussions with several of his children.\n\nIn 1966, he was appointed Chairman of the Ad hoc Subcommittee on the Handicapped by , then Chairman of the . The sub-committee held hearings in Washington and New York City and Carey introduced HR 14. The \"Carey Bill\" provided, for the first time, a program of grants to the states for \"initiating, expanding or improving education for children with disabilities. It also included other titles mirroring the structure of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, PL 89–10, which Carey had assisted Powell in passing as part of the Lyndon Baines Johnson initiative.\n\nThree parts of the Bill were picked up by the Senate: the grants to states, a new Bureau of Education for the Handicapped in the U.S. Office of Education and a National Advisory Committee. Carey's friend and mentor, John Fogerty of Rhode Island, the powerful Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee which provided funding for all Health, Education and Welfare programs, backed his legislation. The bill became Title VI of the ESEA, as Public Law 89-750, in 1966. Carey also sponsored and saw passed that year The Model Secondary School for the Deaf Bill, to be established on the campus of the . In 1965, he and Fogerty had sponsored The National Technical Institute for the Deaf, which was awarded to the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nThe Carey Bill and its grant program to the states began with a $2.5 million appropriation, to provide each state with $50,000 to plan for its implementation. The second year, the appropriation was $12.25 million, distributed to the states in proportion to their population. In 1975 Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Bill, PL 94-142 which today distributes approximately $11 billion to the states for this purpose.\n\nHe served on the  and led the effort to pass the first Federal Aid to Education program. He was elected Governor of New York in 1974 and resigned his Congressional seat on December 31, 1974.\n\n\nIn 1969 Carey ran briefly for the Democratic nomination for Mayor. He then agreed to run for City Council President on the ticket led by former Mayor  Carey narrowly lost the primary to incumbent City Council President . Then he briefly mounted an independent bid for Mayor, from which he withdrew after the death of his two eldest sons in a car accident.\n\n\n\nIn the , Carey became New York's first Democratic governor in 16 years, defeating  for the Democratic nomination and then unseating incumbent Republican , who had assumed the office after  resigned in December 1973 to serve on the .

Carey came into office with New York City close to bankruptcy and is credited with bringing business and labor together to help save New York City from the fiscal crisis. Carey managed to keep the growth of state spending below the rate of inflation through his frequent use of line-item vetoes and fights with the , which was at the time divided between a Republican-controlled  and a Democratic-controlled .\n\nUpon taking office, Carey cut taxes significantly, reducing corporate taxes from 14% to 10%, and capping personal income tax at 9%, and reducing capital gains taxes as well. His administration also offered tax credits to encourage new investment. |language=en}}  As governor, he was responsible for building the ; ; the  and the economic development of New York City's outer boroughs.

He also made major strides in community programs for the . Carey also pardoned Cleveland \"Jomo\" Davis, one of the leaders of the .\n\nCarey's tenure in office was marked by a growing awareness of the environmental consequences of New York's strong industrial base, including the designation by the federal government of the  disaster area. Carey made environmental issues a priority of his administration. Carey was vilified by Love Canal residents for being more concerned about the state's finances than the health of families living amidst one of the nation's most infamous environmental disasters.\n\nAlong with Senators  and  and  , Carey led efforts to end the violence in  and support peace in the region. The four Irish-American politicians called themselves \"The Four Horsemen.\"\n\nIn 1977, he suffered a major setback, when he lost the case . He batted for a law which prevented ''Population Services International'' [PSI] to distribute contraceptives to minors below 16 years. But Supreme Court thought otherwise. According to the Supreme Court, it was a violation of minors' right to privacy.\n\nCarey considered running for president in  and . Carey's first wife had died in 1974, and Carey later attributed his decision not to seek the  to her death. In , he was challenged for re-election by State Assembly Minority Leader and former Assembly Speaker . After a competitive, sometimes negative campaign, Carey was the first Democrat re-elected in 40 years, In 1980 he decriminalized homosexuality in New York State.\n\nAccording to political scientist and author Daniel C. Kramer \"The Carey Administration had a hand in many important projects, the modernization of New York City's subways and the rescue of homeowners living in the Love Canal neighborhood being just two, before Carey committed several serious blunders which lowered voters' opinion of him that he decided not to run for reelection in 1982. Through it all, this man with the embarassingly-low poll ratings turned into a superb governor.\" On January 1, 1983, he was succeeded by his , .\n\n\nIn 1989, Carey announced that he was no longer pro-choice and regretted his support for legalized abortion and public financing of abortion as governor. In 1992, he joined other  leaders in signing the anti-abortion document \"A New American Compact: Caring About Women, Caring for the Unborn.\"\n\nLater in his life, he was  at the law firm of . He continued to practice law as a member of the  law firm and sat on the board of  , the  controlled holding company.\n\n\nIn 1947, Carey married Helen Owen (1924–1974). They became the parents of Alexandria, Christopher, Susan, Peter, Hugh Jr., Michael, Donald, Marianne, Nancy, Helen, Bryan, , Kevin, and Thomas. Beginning in 1961, the family resided at 61 Prospect Park West, a 1910 Park Slope mansion built for the daughter of  chairman and  philanthropist William H. Childs; a decade later, Carey sold the home to journalist . His wife, Helen, died of breast cancer in 1974. Peter and Hugh Jr. died in an automobile accident in 1969. Carey was devastated by the death of his wife and laid to rest any plans for the White House. Paul, who served as White House Special Assistant to President  as well as 77th Commissioner of the , died of cancer in 2001.\n\nIn 1981, Carey married Evangeline Gouletas, a Chicago-based real estate mogul, just three months after meeting her. This marriage proved controversial and a political liability. The marriage generated controversy due to false statements Gouletas made about her marital history. Initially, Gouletas claimed that she was a widow of a single marriage but later affirmed on the marriage license that she had two ex-husbands. Gouletas also said that her first husband, with whom she had a daughter, was dead, but he was still alive at the time. In reality, she actually had three previous marriages, and all three of her former husbands were still living at the time. The marriage also caused trouble for Carey with the Catholic Church, since he married a thrice-divorced woman in a ; the church, which does not recognize civil no-fault divorce, refused to perform communion. To an extent, the marriage also hurt his public reputation. Carey and Gouletas divorced in 1989.\nCarey later described this marriage as \"his greatest failure.\" was named for Carey in 1984.]]Carey died surrounded by his family on August 7, 2011, aged 92.

Esposito served as chairman of the  from 1969 to 1984. As a leader, he was known as a political fixer, and honored loyalty, running a citywide patronage system involving gratuity exchanges that ultimately resulted in multiple municipal corruption scandals. \n\nFollowing the election of  to the mayoralty in 1977 (an outcome facilitated by Esposito's support, which was obscured by mutual agreement due to Koch's political origins in the postwar, Manhattan-based \"\" movement), Esposito emerged as New York City's paramount political leader and ''de facto'' shadow mayor, with a multiracial sphere of influence that encompassed such disparate figures as  political leaders ,  and Ramon S. Velez; Brooklyn Assemblymen  (who also served as  at the peak of Esposito's influence) and ;  Borough President ; Brooklyn Borough President ; Brooklyn Representatives ,  and ;  fixer ; real estate developers  and  (the latter would ultimately serve as the  from 2017 to 2021); and  leaders  and . Critics called him a \"medieval king holding court with his barons by sections of the press\". \n\nAlthough he ensconced himself in the tradition of urban \"Regular Democrat\" , Esposito personally identified as a political  in marked contrast to many of his successors, frequently speaking of his admiration for  (whom he supported at great political risk in the ) and . He also was a vociferous supporter of New York City's first (and ultimately unsuccessful)  bill. As the apex of his power coincided with historic population declines in New York stemming from decades-long , Esposito moved beyond his  base in southeastern Brooklyn to collaborate with leaders of nascent  and  communities throughout the borough, such as City Councilman  and his successor, . \n\nBy the early 1980s, several Brooklyn-based elected officials with national ambitionsmost notably Kings County District Attorney ,  Representative  and future  had either directly repudiated or distanced themselves from Esposito's influence, although  and  reported that Schumer met publicly with Esposito for lunch on at least one occasion.\n\nIn 1983, investigations into his activities mounted; this, along with a thwarted leadership challenge from erstwhile protege Genovesi (who Esposito believed had been \"openly salivating\" for his departure) would prompt his retirement in January 1984. Three years later, he was convicted of giving an illegal gratuity in the , having given Bronx Representative  a spa vacation in . As a result of this and related scandals (including Manes' suicide and Friedman's conviction on federal corruption charges) amid the political emergence of reform-minded rivals  and , the Esposito machine effectively collapsed. During this period, several fledgling African American politicians also withdrew their support, precipitating the 1990 election of  as county chairman of what had momentarily descended into a \"largely vestigial structure\".\n\nEsposito was respected and feared for his street-style management, intimidation tactics and criminal connections. He became known for running politics similar to a junket.\n\n\nAmadeo \"Meade\" Esposito was born in the subsection of  (alternatively characterized as part of  or ) in 1907. He was the son of Giuseppe and Felicia Esposito. His grandfather came to America from  in 1885. His father followed his grandfather in 1900 and arrived in America at the age of 18. Giuseppe became a saloon owner. Meade lived with his two sisters above the saloon and claimed to have started working as a child.\n\nEsposito grew up in Brownsville (then a predominately Jewish neighborhood with smaller Irish and Italian populations) and received his nickname \"Meade\" during elementary school. He briefly attended 's Manual Training High School, now known as the , but dropped out at the age of 14. He married at the age of 18 and became a father by 19. \n\nDespite his dearth of formal education, colleagues lauded Esposito as a keen  \"who read everything from comic books to .\"\n\n\nAfter dropping out of school, Esposito found employment at an  business (a field he would return to throughout his career) operated by Jim Powers, a former  and local Democratic leader. There, Esposito met , another Brooklyn Democratic leader who went on to secure the presidential nomination for  at the party's . Although Schorenstein was , his blunt, transactional management style would profoundly influence Esposito. At the age of 18, Esposito \"got a couple of dozen of the guys together\" and started the Progressive Democratic Club on Fulton Street.\n\nDuring the  and the early postwar era, he primarily worked as a  salesman and . He met many of his future connections through the latter business. Esposito cultivated ethnic and community ties that encouraged more Italian Americans to move into politics. He launched the political career of prominent Brownsville-based haberdasher  (who served as  from 1954 to 1961 and  of Brooklyn from 1962 to 1970) and assisted in electing longtime  member , best known for co-founding the . \n\nAmid  and white flight-driven demographic shifts in Ocean Hill-Brownsville and adjacent  throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Esposito's predominantly Italian and Jewish base gradually migrated to southeastern Brooklyn's semi-suburban belt of ,  and , culminating in the formation of the  39th Assembly District to represent these constituencies in 1972. As early as 1958, Esposito ran for Democratic district leader in Canarsie on a ticket with co‐leader candidate Shirley Weiner. Although they lost by 200 votes, Esposito was ultimately elected to the post in 1960 after being endorsed by Eleanor Roosevelt and . During this period, his influence continued to grow in tandem with the Canarsie-based  Democratic Club, which served as his primary political base for the remainder of his career.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Esposito began to personally select many judges and politicians in Brooklyn. From 1960 to 1970, he also served as assistant vice president of the Kings Lafayette Bank (which was subsumed by the -led  in 1966) for an indeterminate period of time \"despite no apparent experience\" in the profession. Jack Newfield would later report that Esposito sought the position to distance himself from his bondsman career to better ensure his political ascension, while \"the single biggest depositor in the bank\" during his incumbency \"was the [Anthony Scotto-affiliated ], which many law enforcement agencies believe is Mafia-dominated [...] It is suspected that the ILA used its influence to get Esposito the job.\"\n\nAlthough Esposito attained his longtime goal of becoming chairman of the Kings County Democratic Committee in 1969 as part of a byzantine power-sharing agreement with \"sometimes friend and often business partner\"  (who sought to consolidate his control of the 's Democratic caucus in preparation for assuming the speakership), the Jefferson Club's influence was initially overshadowed by the enduring dominance of Steingut's -based  Democratic Club, a predominantly Jewish political clearinghouse for such figures as future New York City Mayor , veteran  , prominent jurist Nat Sobel and members of the . After Beame lost the mayoralty in 1977, the balance of power in municipal politics gradually shifted to Esposito, with accelerating white flight in East Flatbush and the concomitant death of Steingut organization  Beadie Markowitz (an Esposito ally for decades because of their mutual roots in the Schorenstein machine) in early 1978 all but assuring the then-Speaker's decisive defeat by -backed primary challenger Murray Weinstein (later succeeded by his daughter, ). \n\nSome observers have asserted that Esposito's authority was functionally attenuated throughout this period due to the failed campaigns of several Esposito-Steingut endorsees, including former   (who unsuccessfully sought the 1974 Democratic gubernatorial nomination in a voluble campaign managed by ) and longstanding Washington Senator , a seminal  who ran for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination; both were primarily favored by Steingut, with the latter retaining support from the machine for most of the 1976 primary season (mainly due to his advocacy for  and opposition to ) despite late Madison Club attorney James Harrison Cohen's efforts to campaign for , the eventual nominee. As county leader, Esposito became the main interlocutor between the bellicose eastern Brooklyn constituencies and a less visible coterie of high-ranking s in western Brooklyn, including former  administrative director and longtime //South Brooklyn district leader , who was blocked from ascending to the chairmanship of the County Committee by Esposito in 1969; fellow district leader Anthony Caracciolo, whose expansive territory included all or part of such transitional neighborhoods as , ,  and ; and Windsor Terrace-based  Majority Leader . The unanticipated election of alleged Mangano-Caracciolo proxy Bernard M. Bloom (then leader of the eastern Flatbush-based  Democratic Club) as  (a role charged with overseeing lucrative  and estate proceedings) in 1976 may have deprived the Esposito-Steingut machine of a key patronage tranche as retribution for the 1969 \"coup\", although Cohen asserted in his 2019 memoir that Esposito personally \"tapped\" Bloom to serve in the role after \"quietly [supporting]\" Hugh Carey, the Mangano-Caracciolo-Bloom faction's successful 1974 gubernatorial candidate.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, Esposito was tried for allegedly violating a state law barring New York county political leaders from engaging in business dealings with race tracks. Citing the rules of the Kings County Democratic Committee, New York Supreme Court Justice Alvin Klein ruled that Esposito had not violated the law since he was formally identified as chairman of the Committee's executive subcommittee. According to Ken Auletta, Esposito had previously characterized himself as county leader in a 1976 interview with ''''.\n\nBy the 1970s, Esposito's legitimate employment had primarily shifted to the proprietorship of at least two lower Manhattan-based s; these included the Grand Brokerage (also known as the Grand Insurance Agency)a partnership between Esposito, Steingut and prominent  reform Democratic leader Lester Zirinand Serres, Visone, & Rice, a similar venture between Esposito and former Brooklyn Heights/Fort Greene/South Brooklyn Assemblyman Joseph Martuscello that functioned as Esposito's main business for the remainder of his life. Esposito and Martuscello also co-owned several properties, including a  brownstone, a villa in a  resort and a 50-foot yacht. Esposito's involvement in the former concern appears to have faded following a 1974-75 investigation of money laundering and organized crime involvement in the city's nursing home industry; it was ultimately dissolved amid Steingut's pursuit of a Manhattan legal career in 1982. In press interviews, Esposito noted that he was \"not a broker\" at either firm, claiming that he instead served as a \"stockholder\" and \"more of an administrator.\" During the 1980s, he also owned a stake in Beaumont Offset Printing, a printing firm ran by his daughter that was contracted by various New York political campaigns.\n\nEsposito elicited a variety of perceptions from his peers. While  called him a \"new breed of party leader\", , a critic of Esposito, called him \"an old-line boss\". During his tenure as county leader, his connections to known Mafia members and associates had become common knowledge. He grew up alongside many of these figures, who continued to retain him during his years as a bail bondsman. In 1972, during a federal investigation into the , Esposito's name was frequently mentioned in a bugged junkyard trailer used as an office by Paul Vario.\n\nPoliticians traded favors and gifts with Esposito for political influence and positions, a process that greatly accelerated after he became New York City's preeminent political boss in 1978. By 1983, investigations into his increasingly conspicuous activities were growing. Despite claiming he would never retire, Esposito left his position as leader of the Kings County Democratic Committee in January 1984, unexpectedly leaving the position to incumbent Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden amid internal conflict with former protege \"Fat Tony\" Genovesi.\n\nNevertheless, Esposito continued to retain significant surreptitious influence in New York City politics after his retirement. In the fall of 1985, during an  investigation into the , Esposito was heard speaking with lifelong friend , a  in the organization. This led to a direct wiretap of Esposito's phone. \n\nLater in 1985, Esposito was recorded speaking with Mario Biaggi, claiming to have \"\" 42 judges in Brooklyn. Biaggi was charged in 1987 with taking an unlawful gratuity, having accepted a free $3,200 vacation in Florida from Esposito. Prosecutors said it was in exchange for using his influence to help a ship-repair company that was a major client of Serres, Visone, & Rice. The defense said it was given out of friendship, and no favors were done in return. While Biaggi was acquitted of both bribery and conspiracy, he was convicted of accepting an illegal gratuity and , sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, and fined $500,000. Esposito received a suspended sentence. Esposito was put on probation, sentenced to community service and fined $500,000.\n\nIn 1989, Esposito faced additional charges of bribery and tax fraud; however a federal judge determined Esposito was too sick and elderly to maintain a proper defense.\n\n\nEsposito was known for his \"blunt, warm and earthy\" nature. He frequently smoked cigars and kept a baseball bat under his desk to symbolically enforce power. Donald Trump, whose family's real estate business frequently interlocked with elements of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, respected Esposito and his management style. Esposito had a daughter, Phyllis. \n\nAt the height of his power, Esposito primarily resided at 2600 National Drive, a waterfront property in Mill Basin. He also maintained a residence in . In 1987, he moved his principal residence to .\n\nWhile serving as county leader, Esposito eschewed written memoranda and held important meetings in the basement of his mother's Canarsie house to evade potential  at his  office and Mill Basin home. The elder Esposito usually prepared homemade  for her guests.\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Esposito developed  and . He died of a blood infection at  in Manhasset on September 3, 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Massa identified his declining health and the ongoing ethics investigation as the reasons for his resignation; however, he later said that there was a conspiracy \"to oust him because he had voted against overhauling health care.\" It was reported in 2017 that Congress had paid nearly $100,000 to  the  claims made by two male staffers against Massa.\n\n\nEric James Joseph Massa was born in  on September 16, 1959. The son of a career  officer, Massa grew up in various locations, including  and . After graduating from the  Massa was on active duty in the Navy for 24 years. He served in the Persian Gulf War and also served as aide to General . Near the end of his Navy career, he was diagnosed with , from which he later recovered.\n\nUpon retirement from the military, Massa moved to  to work for the  in 2001. He lost his job due to downsizing and moved to Washington to work as a Republican staffer for the House Armed Services Committee in 2003. Massa was fired after it became known that he had written to his former boss, Democrat Wesley Clark, with advice on his presidential campaign. Thereafter, Massa joined the Democratic Party. He coordinated veterans' outreach efforts in New Hampshire and Virginia during Clark's unsuccessful .\n\n\n\n;2006\n\nIn 2006, Massa ran for Congress in New York's 29th congressional district on the strength of his military background, which it was hoped would appeal to veterans and to independents who favor a strong defense policy.  During the campaign, Massa positioned himself as strongly opposed to the Iraq war and unrestricted , favoring instead . Other issues in his platform included expanding farm aid programs, as well as bringing homeland security money to the .\n\nOn Election night, incumbent Republican Rep.  led Massa by a 52%-48% margin. Massa requested a recount and an accounting of absentee ballots because 6,000 votes separated the two and 10,000 were left to be counted. After a week of waiting, the ballots were approximately even and Congressman Kuhl was re-elected. Massa conceded the election with a telephone call to Congressman Kuhl.\n\n;2008\n\nAlmost immediately after conceding defeat in 2006, Massa prepared for a rematch against Kuhl in 2008.  The race remained tight through the campaign; however, Massa emerged victorious, defeating Kuhl 51% to 49% (a margin of approximately 4000 votes), although Kuhl did not immediately concede defeat. All voting machines were impounded at Kuhl's request (pending a re-count), with 12,000 absentee ballots to be counted. The recount yielded a margin of victory of approximately 4,000 votes for Massa, and Kuhl conceded the race on November 21. Some press reports attributed Massa's victory to the plurality he attained among voters in , which voted for Kuhl in 2004 and 2006.\n\n\nMassa was assigned a seat on the . He also inherited Kuhl's seat on the  and was given a seat the .\n\nMassa voted in favor of, and generally supported, the , but has said he finds faults with the legislation. After the act failed to generate the expected stimulus to the Southern Tier economy, Massa claimed that virtually all of the stimulus funds were funneled to the state governments and diverted to interests in New York City.\n\nIn April 2009, Massa was noted for his suggestion to close the  as a response to the , which originated in Mexico. He also was a leading critic of 's abortive plan to charge a  rate for its .\n\nThough he generally supported a health care reform plan, he opposed, and voted against, the  by the Obama administration, due to the cost, and preferred a  system instead.\n\nDuring the 2009 Netroots Nation convention held in Pittsburgh, PA, Massa told a group of activists that he \"will vote adamantly against the interests of my district if I actually think what I am doing is going to be helpful\" in regard to a single-payer health care system. Moments later Massa clarified that he meant he would vote against the \"opinions\" of his constituents if he thought it was the right thing to do. He also controversially exclaimed that Sen. 's comments describing end-of-life care as \"\" constitute \"an act of treason.\"\n\n\nOn October 10, 2009, Massa announced his plans for re-election, saying, \"I don't want to play games with people about speculation, I want to be very direct and candid.\"\n\nOn a press conference call on March 3, 2010, Massa announced that his cancer had returned and that he would not seek re-election. In his statement, Massa addressed allegations of , but claimed he would stay on for the remainder of his term.\n\nThe next day, March 4, 2010, House Majority Leader  confirmed that the  was investigating allegations against Massa of  as the result of a complaint that a senior member of Massa's staff had filed with the committee on February 8, 2010. The investigation was said to involve alleged sexual advances and harassment toward a younger male member of Massa's staff.\n\nAt a press conference, Massa described his behavior and his language as \"salty,\" claiming that he had apologized to the parties in question, did not know of the specific allegations, and did not make the decision to retire based upon such allegations.\n\n\nMassa announced on March 5, 2010, that he would resign his seat in Congress effective 5:00&nbsp;p.m. on March 8, 2010.  In a published statement on his website, Massa identified his declining health and the ongoing ethics investigation as the reasons for his departure. He apologized in response to the  complaint, saying that \"There is no doubt in my mind that I did in fact, use language in the privacy of my own home and in my inner office that, after 24 years in the navy, might make a Chief Petty Officer feel uncomfortable. In fact, there is no doubt that this ethics issue is my fault and mine alone.\"\n\nMassa later claimed that there was a conspiracy to remove him from Congress \"because he had voted against overhauling health care.\" Massa placed specific blame for his resignation on White House Chief of Staff , stating that Emanuel \"is the son of the devil's spawn...  He is an individual who would sell his mother to get a vote. He would strap his children to the front end of a steam locomotive.\" Massa also commented on the following alleged confrontation with Emanuel in the congressional gym locker room:  \"I am sitting there showering, naked as a jaybird, and here comes Rahm Emanuel, not even with a towel wrapped around his tush, poking his finger in my chest, yelling at me because I wasn't going to vote for the president's budget...  He goes there to intimidate members of Congress... He's hated me since day one, and now he wins. He'll get rid of me, and this bill will pass.\" A Democratic spokesperson denied the existence of the alleged conspiracy.\n\nOn March 10, 2010, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Massa was under investigation for allegations that he had groped multiple male staffers working in his office. The ''Post'' reported:\n\nThe freshman Democrat told  host  that \"not only did I grope [a staffer], I d him until he couldn't breathe,\" then said hours later on 's \"\" that \"it is not true\" that he groped anyone on his staff.\n\nHe told Beck that he resigned from the House because he made the mistake of \"getting too familiar with my staff\" members, but he told King that he left primarily for health reasons. Massa, 50, has survived non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but he said he is afraid that he is facing his \"third major cancer-recurrence scare.\"\n\nIn his interview with Beck, the married Massa acknowledged that he shared a Washington residence with several unmarried male staffers as a cost-saving measure.\n\nMassa claimed that he contemplated  at least twice on his way back to his home in , following his resignation. Later campaign finance filings revealed that his campaign funds were being used to fund his wife's salary well after his resignation, as well as to pay legal fees stemming from disputes with his staffers. The payments to his wife continued until the end of 2012.\n\nIn 2017, the '''' reported that Congress had paid nearly $100,000 to  the  claims made by two male staffers against Massa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*''''''\n**\n**\n*''''''\n**\n**\n*''''''\n**\n**\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\nHutchinson, Laura.  .

Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in , stating, \"We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished.\" The two intended to use a provision of the  to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.\n\nWeiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration's proposal to sell over $60&nbsp;billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: \"Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message\", and described Saudi Arabia as having a \"history of financing terrorism\" and teaching \" and Jews\" to its schoolchildren.\n\n\nIn July 2008, '''' characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses. The newspaper described him as a person who often worked long hours with his staff and required them to be in constant contact via . He frequently yelled at them and occasionally threw office furniture in anger. As a result of Weiner's actions, the ''Times'' reported that he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress; this included the departure of three chiefs of staff within an 18-month period. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said that his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting.

After several days of denying that he had posted the image, Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had \"exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years\" and apologized for his earlier denials. After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of '''', Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress, and he formally did so on June 21. A special election was held on September 13, 2011, to replace him; Republican businessman  defeated Democrat  to fill Weiner's seat.\n\nA second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, which was several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race. Weiner sent explicit photos under an alias to a 22-year-old woman with whom he had contact as late as April 2013, which was more than a year after he had left Congress. The woman was later identified as Sydney Leathers.\n\nOn August 28, 2016, the '''' reported that Weiner had  another woman, including sending a picture while he was lying in bed with his young son.

During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.\"\n\nIn September 2016, claims were published that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident.

He presented a book of 50 \"Real Solutions\" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems. One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed \"Weiner's Cleaners\".\n\nWeiner started out last in many polls, but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had  with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator  and  , had urged him to concede.  put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official .\n\n\nWeiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009.

Following the second set of sexting allegations, he acknowledged on July 23, 2013, that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as “an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man”. Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, , in which he announced that he would continue his campaign. At the press conference, Weiner said, \"I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.”\n\n\nOn July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner's campaign chief, announced his resignation.

Monserrate, then chairing the Council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, argued that this order would worsen relations between immigrant communities and the police.

The long-term project aimed to clear the  industrial area, clear up pollution, and develop a hotel and convention center. However, it was initially opposed by a majority of the existing business owners. Monserrate changed his mind and supported the development after being assured that one-third of the housing would be \"affordable\" and that the city would offer businesses an opportunity to relocate.

The petition was granted, and according to the ''New York Post'', Monserrate and Giraldo kissed and held hands.

In 2006 and 2007, then-Councilmember Monserrate allocated $300,000 in discretionary city funding to LIBRE, and the indictment charged that approximately one-third of that funding went toward paying LIBRE staff for their campaign-related work.  After the court proceeding, he was freed after posting a $500,000 bond, secured by a home belonging to his parents. Millions of dollars in so-called discretionary member items had been allocated by members of the City Council to non-profit groups with ties to the members.  The investigation of Monserrate was part of a broad federal investigation to determine if these funds had been used for the members' personal or political expenses.\n\nMonserrate was assigned a court-appointed attorney.

She is a member of the  for the , which is based in , .\n\n\nUng was born in  to ethnically  parents. Her family fled to  soon after she was born to escape the , and immigrated to the  when Ung was seven years old.\n\nAfter growing up in , , Ung attended  for her undergraduate degree, and went on to receive her  from  in 2001.\n\n\nPrior to seeking elected office, Ung held a number of jobs in and around New York politics, among them  to Assemblyman (and father to ) , legislative assistant to   and , and most recently special assistant to Congresswoman Meng. She has also worked as a practicing attorney at the firm .\n\n\nIn July 2020, Ung announced she would run as a  for the  of the , held by term-limited incumbent , in . She received influential endorsements from the Queens Democratic Party and Congresswoman Meng, and was among the top fundraisers in City Council races across the city, cementing her as the race's frontrunner.\n\nIn an effort to overcome Ung's advantages, seven of her opponents in the race formed a coalition together in May 2021, with each candidate encouraging their voters to rank other non-Ung candidates on their  ballots. The seven ran on significantly different platforms–among them were John Choe, the race's most left-wing candidate, and Neng Wang, its most conservative–but argued that they were united against the Queens Democratic Party's influence.\n\nUng nevertheless emerged with a lead on election night in June, receiving 24 percent of first-choice votes. When s and ranked-choice votes were counted two weeks later, she defeated former Assemblywoman  55-45%; she formally declared victory on July 7. Ung easily won the November  in the strongly Democratic district.\n\n\nInaugurated in January, 2022, Ung was named as the Chair of the Committee on Government Operations for her first term in the City Council. The Committee has jurisdiction over Federal and State legislation (including Home Rule requests), municipal governmental structure and organization, and includes several important city agencies including New York City's Department of Citywide Administrative Services, Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, Board of Elections, Board of Standards and Appeals, Campaign Finance Board, Commission on Public Information and Communication, Community Boards, Department of Records and Information Services, Financial Services Agency, and the Law Department.\n\nAs Chair, Ung held several oversight hearings on the city's elections, including on public campaign financing of elections. Ung also held hearings on New York City's Civic Engagement Commission and on NYC's Community Boards.\n\nIn her first term, Ung introduced 29 bills and resolutions, 12 of which passed during the City Council's 2022-2023 term. Ung's bills included a bill requiring the Board of Elections to redesign ballots to make it more clear for speakers of a language other than English, two bills that improved the 311 call experience for LEP (Limited English Proficiency) New Yorkers and a bill requiring the Department of Transportation to report on potential locations for the construction of a bus transit center in Flushing. Ung also passed several resolutions, including one calling for Lunar New Year to be made a federal holiday and one calling on the New York State Legislature to expand financial relief programs to assist New Yorkers struggling to pay their utility bills.\n\nIn her 2024 term, Ung was appointed to be the Chair of the Committee on Standards and Ethics. Ung was also appointed to the Leadership team of the Council, which works with the Council Speaker to steer the legislative body's priorities, and the Budget Negotiations Team, which negotiates the city's budget with the mayoral administration.\n\n\nUng lives in  where she is the primary caretaker for her mother. Ung is a marathon runner, having completed the New York City marathon.\n\n\nIn 2022, home healthcare workers organized a protest outside of Sandra Ung's City Council district office demanding that she support city legislation (called The No More 24 Act) limiting the number of hours that home healthcare aides can work in a day. They want their employers to limit their work schedule to 12 hours a day and 50 hours a week. Many of these workers provide care for 24 consecutive hours. This protest was organized by the Flushing Workers Center. The City Council Speaker's office said that the legislative efforts on the City Council level were misdirected because home health care is funded primarily through Medicaid, which is managed at the state level. Council Member Ung wants the non-profit employers to hire more home healthcare workers and wants the State of New York make adjustments to the Medicare reimbursement policy so that patients who need attentive care are not left unattended. Council Member Ung called the current system unjust and held a rally with SEIU 1199 homecare workers, union representatives and disability activists calling on the state government end 24-hour shifts and provide funding to split them into two, 12-hour shifts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He has also supported efforts for peace in many areas of the world, and has been actively involved in the .\n\n\nOn a previous policy position from his website, Higgins said: \"For too long, the  has under-funded and under-staffed hearing offices in  ... Citizens who have contributed to the  system throughout their lives should have proper customer service when their benefits come due.\"\n\nIn 2010, Higgins and many other congressional members sent President  a letter, encouraging him to keep Social Security and make it stronger, saying: \"We write today to express our strong support for Social Security and our view that it should be strengthened. We oppose any cuts to Social Security benefits, including raising the retirement age. We also oppose any effort to privatize Social Security, in whole or in part ... Cutting Social Security benefits beyond the already scheduled increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 would create even more needless hardship for millions of vulnerable Americans.\" This was in response to Obama giving the task of cutting government spending to the  on October 15, 2010. The letter also stressed that Social Security is \"prohibited by law from adding to the national budget deficit\".\n\nHiggins opposes privatizing Social Security. He \"support[s] full funding for the Social Security Administration to process checks on time; fight against waste, fraud, and abuse; and combat unacceptable claims backlogs\". His district includes nearly 150,000 senior citizens. Higgins introduced related legislation, House Resolution (HR) 3997, in February 2014. The bill aims requires the Social Security Commissioner to submit an estimated annual budget, and to submit the estimated budget to Congress before submitting it to the President; prohibits the closing or limitation of field offices and hearing offices without justification; and mandates particular procedures related to closings, consolidations, and/or public limitations.\n\n\nIn the  from 1999 to 2002, Higgins supported certain  measures, but since 2003, he has identified himself as . In 2006, Higgins was given a rating of 9% by the NRLC, which indicates a pro-choice stance. Higgins received a score of 100% (a perfect score) from  in 2012, and from  in 2011.\n\n\nHiggins voted for the , also known as \"ObamaCare\". In June 2012, Higgins said he believed that health care providers will have to embrace \"Accountable Care Organizations, comparative effectiveness research  which studies various treatments to determine what works best  and other changes\". He believed that this should have been done decades ago.\n\nOn his congressional website, Higgins has stated that \"there is no question that [the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act] was needed\". He added that it is a beginning of health care reform in the United States.\n\nHiggins strongly believes in a national health care program, with a \"public option\", whereby the government provides health insurance that would compete with other businesses' plans. A letter Higgins signed from a group of representatives to Senator , then the Senate Majority Leader, stated: \"As the Senate continues to work on health reform legislation, we strongly urge you to consider including a public option.\" The  gave Higgins a perfect rating of 100% in 2009.\n\n\nIt was reported that Higgins was \"proposing something unprecedented in this era of $1.3 trillion annual deficits: a $1.25 trillion, five-year plan to rebuild the nation's roads, bridges, railroads, ports, and airports\".}} Higgins's website gives the cost of these endeavors as $1.2 trillion. The bill, the Nation Building Here at Home Act, based on research by the , would cost significantly more than Obama's $787 billion . Higgins said that he wants to rebuild the US, \"as we've rebuilt other countries  Iraq and Afghanistan  in recent years\". He also said that it is not a stimulus bill, but a \"nation-building bill\".\n\n\nHiggins is a supporter of education, including early education through higher education. He has said, \"Every child has a right to a quality education.\" Ensuring that young people have a quality early education, and that legislators are supportive of education for individuals in primary, elementary, secondary, and higher educational institutions, are among Higgins's aims. He is a proponent of congressional support for measures that increase student achievement, but that also reward success, rather than punish failure, as the No Child Left Behind Act has done. Higgins further believes that financial barriers to education should not hinder anyone from pursuing higher education.\n\n\nHiggins supports maintaining lower interest rates on loans incurred by college and university students. He co-sponsored two bills  H.R. 3826, and H.R. 4816  in efforts to extend the period of time in maintaining the reduced 3.4% interest rate on student loans. In 2007, Higgins supported The College Cost Reduction and Access Act, a bill passed into law that included the reduced 3.4% interest rate on subsidized Stafford student loans through the end of the 2012 academic year.\n\n\nIn 2023, Higgins was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President  to remove U.S. troops from  within 180 days.\n\n\nHiggins resides in .

IDNYC aides the homeless, youth, the elderly, undocumented immigrants, the formerly incarcerated and others who may have difficulty obtaining other government-issued ID. IDNYC is recognized ID for interacting with NYPD and allows cardholders to gain access to all City buildings that provide public services. It is an accepted form of identification for accessing numerous City programs and services such as the Brooklyn Public Library, the Queens Library, and the New York City Public Library, the three library systems serving the City of New York. Several NYC cultural institutions grant cardholders free one-year memberships; these include museums, zoos, concert halls, and botanical gardens.\n\nIn 2015, Dromm said he opposed a bill sponsored by New York City Council Member David Greenfield to allow non-public schools (including religious and charter schools) to request that safety agents from the New York Police Department be posted inside the schools and be funded by the Board of Education.

I have a lot of other stuff going on. And it's just notethics is a big priority for me. But...the...some of the formalities are not necessarily something I make a priority of.\" In July 2022, the U.S. House Ethics Committee said it had decided not to charge Suozzi for failing to file required reports on stock transactions on time because it was not a \"knowing or willful\" act. The committee said its five Democratic and five Republican members unanimously voted to dismiss the referral from the independent federal Office of Congressional Ethics. \n\nIn December 2022, Suozzi disclosed dozens of additional stock trades that were reported up to three years past the federal deadline.\n\n\n\n* \n** Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement\n** Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement and Intelligence\n\n*  Congressman Thomas Suozzi |url=http://suozzi.house.gov/about/committees-and-caucuses |access-date=2024-08-11 |website=suozzi.house.gov |language=en}}\n\n\n\n* Animal Protection Caucus\n* Bipartisan Offshore Wind Caucus\n* \n* Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans\n* Congressional Caucus on Korea\n* Congressional Fire Services Caucus\n* Congressional Friends of Ireland Caucus\n* Congressional High Speed and Passenger Rail Modernization Caucus\n* \n* Congressional Long Island Sound Caucus\n* Congressional Pakistan Caucus\n* Congressional Uyghur Caucus (Co-Founder and Co-Chair)\n* Democrats for Border Security Task Force (Co-Chair)\n* Diabetes Caucus\n* Disaster Equity and Building Resilience Caucus\n* Friends of Kazakhstan Caucus\n* International Conservation Caucus\n* Italian American Congressional Delegation\n* Labor Caucus\n* \n* Quiet Skies Caucus (Vice Chair)\n* SALT Caucus (Co-Chair)\n* \n* Ukraine Caucus\n\n\n in 2024|262x262px]]\nSuozzi and his wife Helene (née Wrotniak) married in 1993.

Her opponent, Richard David, got 31.59% of the vote (2,822 votes) and her other opponent Hettie Powell received 28.98% of the vote. (2,589 votes). Adams went on to win the general election with 85.97% of the vote. During her first term she was elected by her colleagues in the  to serve as co-chair of the body, and at various points also served as chair of the Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions, and later chair of the Committee on Public Safety.\n\nAdams was elected Speaker of the New York City Council in January 2022.  She is the second politician from the borough of Queens to serve as Speaker ( was the first City Council Speaker of New York City).  She is the third woman to serve as Speaker and the first Black person to serve as Speaker. Her election was a defeat for newly elected mayor  (no relation), who had privately been trying to win support for rival Speaker candidate .\n\nCouncil Speaker Adams declined to take up legislation that would prevent New York City public service retirees from being forced into a  plan. The proposed change has been challenged by the New York City Organization of Public Service Retirees and unions such as the , the  professors union. Until 2023, most municipal retirees have been enrolled in traditional Medicare. Council Speaker Adams however, has not helped the retirees protect their health benefits from being stripped from them in retirement and has blocked their proposed legislation from being introduced. \n\nIn 2023, Councilman  drafted a bill, Intro 1099 that was simply two sentences long requiring the City to offer a  plan like retirees are currently in and stating nothing in this bill would interfere with a unions' collective bargaining - an excuse given not to help them.  Retirees are no longer in unions once retired. Speaker Adams not only blocked the bill from being introduced the traditional way, she also intimidated other councilmembers from signing onto it, and prevented Councilwoman  from calling the bill to a hearing in the Civil Service and Labor Committee, letting it die in committee.\n\nRetirees have had to continue to fight in court because the very council that legislated their Medicare benefits over the decades from Mayor  to Councilwoman  of District 28, and former Speaker Peter Vallone, this council has been more loyal to the unions that fund their campaigns than the vulnerable retirees who they should have been helping.  Speaker Adams's First Deputy Chief of Staff is Jeremy John, the former Political Action Director of the  union.\n\n\nAdams is a longtime member of the  and the .

Accessed December 11, 2007.\n\n\nManes was born in Brooklyn, where he graduated from . He briefly attended  before earning a degree in  from . In 1957, he received his  from . He moved to Queens with his family as a teenager. \n\nFollowing his admission to the New York bar, Manes was employed as a  under the aegis of , later serving as an associate counsel to  member  during his successful battle to become the legislative body's majority leader in 1965. That same year, he was elected to the , becoming the youngest member of its Queens delegation from a -based district. He ultimately ascended to the chair of the Council's Housing Committee and emerged as a protégé of influential Councilman , a strident opponent of then-Mayor  who became chair of the Queens Democratic Party in 1971.\n\nElected to his final role at the behest of Troy when he was 37, Manes was the youngest borough president in Queens history. During his tenure, Manes transformed his position from a mid-level policymaking role (although the borough presidents held influential seats on the now-defunct , incumbents generally served as proxies for county party leaders) into a more proactive political job, capitalizing on Queens's historic lack of a robust Democratic political machine in the mold of Manhattan's  or the storied clubhouse scenes in Brooklyn and the Bronx. In 1974, Mayor  worked with Manes to arrange Troy’s ouster as Queens Democratic leader, with Manes assuming the role for the remainder of his life. Troy had angered Manes when he supported  against eventual incumbent  in the 1974 Democratic gubernatorial primary. Manes was re-elected four more times through the turn of the decade, also serving as a delegate to the  during this period.\n\nHis popularity plummeted in late 1985, when he was criticized over two of his pet projects. He wanted to build a  auto racetrack in Queens's largest public park, , where the  and the  had been held. Community leaders denigrated the idea, and it became the first major project of his that was opposed. Also that year, Manes worked to build a domed football-baseball stadium in the park, but it was opposed by local businessmen in the  area. When Queens couldn't secure a football franchise, the plan died.\n\nOne of his biggest controversies came in late 1985, when Manes wanted to wire the borough for cable television. Manes rejected a proposal by the Queens-based Orth-O-Vision company to place cable lines in the borough, and instead awarded contracts to mega-companies  and , as well as a cable firm owned by former  borough president . Local residents were outraged that he passed over a local firm for large national companies.\n\n\nShortly after his inauguration for a fifth term, Manes attended a dinner party for the new i consul at Borough Hall in  on January 9, 1986. He left in his own car and was followed by his chauffeur up . He was later found in his car in the early morning hours of January 10; his wrists were slit and he was bleeding profusely. He initially claimed that two men had carjacked and attacked him, but later recanted the statement, saying he had attempted .\n\nIn the following weeks, it was alleged that Manes had used political appointments and favors as the source of large  schemes involving personal bureaucratic s, most notably the New York City Parking Violations Bureau. In 1978, Manes installed a friend, Geoffrey Lindenauer, who later cooperated with prosecutors, as the deputy head of the Parking Violations Bureau. With Manes’ help, Lindenauer steered collections of parking fines to a company that paid the two bribes of up to $2,500 per month by 1982. Later in 1982, Manes, Lindenauer and Bronx Democratic Party leader  each received shares in a company called Citisource, which won a city contract to develop a handheld parking ticket computer. Manes also accepted bribes from SRS, a company also involved in parking ticket collections, whose owner also cooperated with authorities. Columnist  published a story on January 23, 1986 in which the head of a third parking collections company confessed to paying $36,000 in bribes to Manes.\n\nZoning and cable TV franchises were being investigated, and some of Manes' appointees and associates were  or forced to resign. Manes' deputy  was installed as acting Borough President on January 28 and he formally resigned on February 11.\n\nThe scandal became nationwide news and a continuing top story in New York City. Manes, now facing the prospect of indictment on corruption charges, stayed in seclusion until March. On the night of March 13, he took a phone call from his psychiatrist, who discussed additional care with Manes (and his wife on an extension phone upstairs). Shortly before 10 p.m. the psychiatrist was called away from the phone and, while on hold, Manes reached into a kitchen drawer, pulled out a large kitchen knife and plunged the eight-inch blade into his heart. His daughter screamed for her mother, who came down to find Manes on the floor in a pool of blood. Marlene Manes pulled the knife from his heart as their daughter frantically called 911. Donald Manes was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nLess than three years later, on November 17, 1988, Morton Manes, Donald Manes' twin brother, attempted suicide in the same manner. He died of a heart attack at the age of 70 in May 2004.\n\nManes was buried at Mt. Ararat Cemetery in .  Manes' successor, , served as Borough President until 2002.\n\n\n* A loosely fictionalized version of the scandal served as the basis for the film '''' (1996).                   \n* The   of the television series '''', \"\", was based on the scandal.\n*Manes' suicide and dealings with attorney Michael Dowd are both referenced on a news broadcast in the opening of the 2023 film ''''.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Although the bill was not passed, it is believed to have influenced McDonald's and later others in the Southeast Queens area and across the country to add healthy food items to their happy meals. This same year, Comrie held high-profile hearings about gang merchandising. The hearings focused on Buffalo-based  who he accused of imitating gang styles to bolster profits. As chair of the Land-Use Committee, in 2013, Comrie helped lead the opposition to the proposed soccer stadium eyeing a home in . The proposal ultimately failed after an outpouring of opposition from the surrounding community.\n\n\nIn 2013, Comrie launched a campaign to succeed  as  of Queens. His campaign promised to push for major investment in Queens infrastructure, particularly adding a new subway for Queens. Early on, Comrie struggled to keep up with his competitors in fundraising and failed to receive the endorsement of the powerful Queens County Democratic Party who chose to support Melinda Katz instead. Comrie would eventually drop out and endorse current Queens Borough President  in the Democratic primary. Comrie would later serve as Deputy Borough President under Katz during her first year in office.\n\n\nAccepting a sizable pay cut, in 2014, Comrie challenged  for the  after his corruption charges and questionable loyalty to the Democratic Party began calls for his replacement. He defeated Smith in the   by a landslide. Following his election to the NYS Senate, Comrie helped lead the search to appoint his replacement as Deputy Borough President eventually selecting Melva Miller, the Queens Borough President's director of economic development and Southeast Queens resident, to the post.\n\nUpon taking office, Comrie was appointed  on the Elections Committee and Consumer Protection Committee.\n\n\nComrie was also selected to be a delegate at the 2016 Democratic National Convention for the New York State 5th Congressional District. Following the election of President Trump, Comrie joined Democrats across the State of New York to call for the Independent Democratic Conference of 8 State Senators to stop supporting the Republican Conference. He even began to vocally protest the institution by participating in town halls organized by their opponents. At one of these town halls, Comrie called his colleague, the Northeast Queens Senator Tony Avella, \"the single most selfish person that I've ever met on a lot of different levels ... He has not reached out to me at all in any type of collegial fashion.\"\n\n\n\nDuring his first legislative session in the New York State Senate, Leroy Comrie also passed a bill that expanded access to  for the disabled.\n\nAs state senator, Comrie has helped lead the community on multiple initiatives such as preventing a state-run juvenile prison from being built on a closed elementary school in Queens Village, fighting the development of a multi-story religious dormitory on the controversial  Lubavitch Jewish synagogue in Cambria Heights/Laurelton, and stopping the closure of the  facility in Cambria Heights which provides medical education and programming to the surrounding community. Comrie also took several high-profile stances against legislation considered by the NYC Council such as working with other Queens elected officials in opposing the congestion pricing proposal, and, in the NYS Senate, repealing the plastic bag fee passed by the NYC Council\n\n\nAs Ranking Member on the Elections Committee, he has pushed for the Vote Better NY legislation package to address \"the catastrophe known as New York's election law\" by establishing early voting, simplifying ballots, and streamlining voter registration. The bills, among others, stalled in the  due to opposition by the Republican leadership in control of the chamber at the time.\n\nComrie introduced legislation that would allow absentee ballot voting without an excuse. It would require amending the .\n\n\nIn 2007, Leroy Comrie was tangentially associated with a controversy regarding the dismissal of Council Member 's chief of staff, Viola Plummer. Following a heated committee meeting on a bill co-naming a street in Brooklyn after , Plummer exited city hall and spoke to a small group in the plaza that included reporters. Plummer, a resident of Comrie's district, threatened to end Comrie's career and politically \"assassinate\" Comrie. These statements, taken in the light of the 2003 assassination of Council Member , led City Council Speaker  to arrange for an  escort for Comrie and to dismiss Plummer. Plummer filed suit in federal court for violation of her  right to free speech but the claims were dismissed. During this trial Comrie testified that he felt \"physically threatened\" but took no personal actions to protect himself.\n\nIn 2011, Comrie made headlines when he chose not to renew the membership of the Chairperson of . Adjoa Gzifa, chairperson of the board for three years, speculated that the decision came when she declared her opposition to numerous high-profile street renaming proposals supported by then-Councilman Comrie, including slain officer John Scarangella and Sean Bell. Since her removal, Ms. Gzifa has reconciled with Comrie and even partnered with him on numerous initiatives.\n\n\nComrie has been married to Marcia Moxam since 1990. They have two children. He is a lifelong member of Saint Alban the Martyr Episcopal Church, where he served as a layperson, vestryman and chalice administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In that November's election, his name was on the ballot on the old  line, for which Davis was fired from the NYPD.  After pursuing litigation against the police department, Davis's claim that he never formally accepted the Liberal Party nomination was upheld and he was allowed to reclaim his job.

He graduated from North Babylon High School and earned a  degree in  and communications at  in 1991. Bellone enlisted in the  in 1992 and served as a Communications Specialist stationed at , Missouri. Bellone earned his Juris Doctor from  and was admitted to the  in 1999.\n\n\nAt age 32, after serving four years on the Babylon Town Board, Bellone was elected Supervisor of Babylon Township in 2001 to represent over 210,000 residents. As Supervisor, Bellone focused on government reform, reducing the size of government and delivering a $4.3 million tax cut to residents.\n\n\nBellone received national attention after spearheading an innovative environmental program called Long Island Green Homes. The program incentivized homeowners to make energy improvement upgrades to their homes to achieve considerable savings on energy bills. Bellone was named Environmentalist of the Year by the 's Long Island Group in 2009 in recognition of this initiative.\n\n\nBellone launched Wyandanch Rising, a comprehensive community revitalization plan in , that attracted over $70 million from government and private partners. This transit-oriented development included plans for a walkable, mixed-use community with bicycle lanes, on-street parking, better-lit sidewalks, safer crosswalks, mixed-use buildings, and public art blended with considerable residential, commercial, restaurant and gallery space.\n\nAs a result of these revitalization efforts, Wyandanch Rising was selected to be the first permanent home of the  museum on October 23, 2014.\n\n\n\nWith over 240,000 votes cast, Bellone was elected with 57% of the vote in 2011 in his bid for Suffolk County Executive. As County Executive, Bellone has focused on restoring structural financial balance, implementing government reforms, improving water quality, and ensuring a high quality of life for Suffolk County residents.\n\nIn 2015, with 99,115 votes, Bellone won reelection as Suffolk County Executive, defeating Jim O'Connor by nearly 25,000 votes.\n\n\nBellone's first term began with an inherited deficit of over US$500 million which coincided with the  of 2008 and 2009. Using the same economic policies instituted in the Town of Babylon to restore fiscal balance, the Bellone administration reduced Suffolk's deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars. The 2015 budget proposal recommends actions to eliminate the budget deficit completely. The Suffolk County deficit currently stands at $89.9 million, a reduction of $411 million in two years.\n\n\nAfter Bellone took office, his administration enacted a series of government reforms and offered a variety of proposals to improve government efficiencies while maintaining reduced staffing levels.  Beginning in 2010, county staffing was reduced by more than 1,100 employees and achieved annual reoccurring savings of over $100 million as a result. The reduction of \"one-shot\" revenues has allowed Suffolk County to focus on long-term budget mitigation efforts.  In addition, Bellone championed the merger of the Suffolk County Comptroller's Office and Suffolk County Treasurer's Office, a move estimated to save $800,000 a year and streamline the county's financial operations. The merger was approved by over 61% of Suffolk County voters in the November 4, 2014 election. The consolidation of the two offices took place on January 1, 2018.\n\n\nIn 2014, Bellone announced that improving the region's water quality would be his administration's top priority, and launched the \"Reclaim Our Water \" initiative, a comprehensive plan to improve Suffolk County's water quality and eradicate .\nFailing and unmaintained septic systems and cesspools had created an excess amount of nitrogen pollution in the region's water supply, becoming a serious threat to Long Island's water quality, wildlife, and quality of life; and had decimated the shellfish industry.  Nitrogen poisoning also destroyed the region's coastal vegetation, which acts as a natural habitat for marine and aviary life as well as a natural buffer against devastating storm surges as seen during .\nThe county identified 360,000 unsewered homes that contributed to nearly 70% of the nitrogen pollution load, and developed an actionable, long-term plan to sewer targeted areas, fortify existing waste water infrastructure, and bring advanced on-site waste water treatment systems to residential properties that were contributing most to the nitrification of waters.\nBellone worked extensively with state and federal officials to secure an investment of more than $380 million to help reduce excess nitrogen pollution, invest in wastewater infrastructure and help protect coastal vegetation and marshlands.\n\n\nBellone initiated a series of economic development plans to build innovation economies throughout Suffolk County to attract highly skilled and knowledge workers, and to keep young professionals on Long Island. Bellone tasked the Suffolk County Department of Economic Development and Planning with developing Suffolk County's first comprehensive master plan in decades to address issues involving land use, the overall economy, traffic and transportation, and natural and built resources. He introduced his Connect Long Island vision, a comprehensive transportation and development plan to connect Suffolk County downtowns, universities and research centers via mass transit. The plan strengthened local businesses by expanding natural customer bases and developed the necessary infrastructure to provide residents with north-to-south transportation options.\n\n\nIn order to maintain core government services while operating with reduced staff, the Bellone administration expanded its Performance Management department, which is responsible for ensuring the county workforce is as productive as possible. The office implemented quality improvements to improve operations in all government departments.\n\n\nBellone was prevented from running for reelection in 2023 by a Suffolk County law on term limits that he had signed and was overwhelmingly passed in a referendum the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was the city's first  mayor and longest-serving mayor of Buffalo. He previously served  as a member of the  and . He is the first African-American politician elected to the New York State Senate to represent a district outside  and the first member of any minority race to represent a majority-white New York State Senate district. He announced in a September press conference that he would resign as mayor of Buffalo sometime in October. Brown's resignation took effect on October 15, 2024, with  serving as acting mayor until the next mayoral election in 2025.\n\nBrown was born and raised in . He rose to office after serving in a variety of political roles. He began his political career as an aide to local representatives in several legislative bodies (Buffalo Common Council, Erie County Legislature, and ) and later became involved in a regional political organization. After several roles as a legislative aide, he was appointed to the   Director of Equal Employment Opportunity post.\n\n\nBrown was raised in  in a  his family shared with his grandparents, who were immigrants from the  island of . He grew up on 200th Street between 100th and 104th Avenues and has several relatives still in the area. As a Queens resident, he was a  and  fan.\n\nBrown was a  at Hollis Presbyterian Church in Queens and was also active in the Central Queens YMCA (now called  ). Brown attended Public School&nbsp;134 in Hollis, junior high school PS&nbsp;109, and , where he played the trumpet in the high school band. Brown and his sister, Andrea, were the first generation in his family to attend college.\n\nAfter graduating from August Martin High School, Brown attended . He played a year of   as a  . While he had considered a potential medical career, Brown graduated in 1983 with a dual  in  and . He subsequently completed a certificate program for senior executives in state and local government at  .\n\n\nAfter college, Brown worked for  for a year as a regional sales representative. Brown quit after a short tenure and took the  exam before becoming  for Buffalo Common Council President George Arthur for two years. He then spent two years as an aide to Erie County Legislator Roger Blackwell (later Erie County Legislature Chairman). Then, he worked for two years under , the Deputy Speaker of the . Subsequently, he served eight years as director of the Erie County division of the  under Erie  . He resigned his directorship in July 1993 to run for public office.\n\nDuring his early career, Brown also became a member of , a political organization that was founded in 1986 by a group of  leaders. Brown eventually served as a vice president of the organization.\n\nBrown was recognized in the November 1989 issue of '''' magazine as one of the \"30 Leaders of the Future\" with a caption that read \"Byron Brown chosen for leadership skills.\" The Buffalo Chapter of the  in 1991 honored him with the  Award for . In 1993 he was selected by Business First for its \"40 Under Forty Honor Roll\". He was awarded the Infinity Broadcasting/ 2001 \"Voice of Power Award\" and the 2004 \"Citizen of the Year\" award. He also received the \"Political Impact Award\" from the  sorority in 2001.\n\nIn 1992, Brown was a delegate to the  from the . His vote was originally pledged to  for the Democratic presidential nomination, but Brown transferred his support to then-Governor  after Kerrey bowed out of the  on March 5, 1992. In 1993, Brown was invited to attend Bill Clinton's Presidential Inauguration.\n\n\nIn his first attempt at public office in 1993, Brown ran for the third district of the Erie County Legislature against incumbent William Robinson and George \"Butch\" Holt, who had Eve's endorsement. Robinson earned the Democratic Party endorsement in June 1993, with the help of Holt who voted for Robinson instead of himself. In June, Brown was notified that he must resign his Erie County cabinet-level post in order to run for public office and he did so in July. Holt won the Democratic nomination with a 267-vote 40–37% margin over Brown in the September 14, 1993 .\n\nBrown won the September 1995 Democratic primary for the Masten District Buffalo Common Council seat. He then took time out from campaigning to attend the October 16, 1995 . Brown ousted 18-year veteran council member, David Collins, to win his seat on the Buffalo Common Council. He beat Collins by a 5,391–1,670 (76–24%) margin in the November 7, 1995 general election. In his 1997 re-election campaign, he won the September 9 Democratic primary handily, and he was unopposed in the November 4 general election. In his 1999 re-election campaign, he again won the Democratic primary easily on September 14, and he won the November 2 general election. Beginning in January 2000, Brown served as part of the first ever African-American majority in the history of the Buffalo Common Council.\n\nIn 1996, '''' described Brown as \"Buffalo's \". While on the council, the future state senator and mayor was called \"bright, creative and hardworking\" in a 1999 ''Buffalo News'' survey.\n\n\nIn 2000, he competed for the Democratic nomination for the New York State Senate 57th District against incumbent  and Samuel A. Herbert. Coppola was endorsed by  . Brown won the September 2000 primary by a wide 18% margin. However, Coppola remained on the ballot in the general election on the ,  and  lines. The  nominee was the politically inexperienced Harrison R. Woolworth. Although Brown began the race without organized political support, he earned endorsements from many veteran non-Western New York politicians such as , , and .\n\nWhen he was sworn into the State Senate on January 1, 2001, Brown became New York's first African-American State Senator elected outside of . He also became the first minority member of the New York State Senate to represent a majority-white district.\n\nDuring Brown's tenure in the New York State Senate, the  was in the minority. Brown was part of the majority that backed  's 2001 plan to build up to three  casinos on  land. The legislation was controversial because it granted  rights to casino operators for the first time in New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with s. Brown supported the casinos as a way to support the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was to apportion the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately 40&nbsp;million.\n\nBy spring of 2003, Brown was a rising star in the declining years of the \"\", a loose political fraternity of , , ,  and sometimes  that had dominated state politics while forging the careers of its members for much of the late 20th century. He was envisioned as a front-runner for the 2006 Democratic nomination as  or as Buffalo's first black mayor. By 2004 it seemed clear that he was eyeing the mayor's office. In the 2004 New York State Senate elections, Republican nominee Al Coppola opposed Brown for the  60th District and garnered only 23% of the vote.\n\n\n\nIn February 2005, Brown announced his candidacy for Mayor of Buffalo. On April 29, 2005, three-term Democratic Mayor Anthony Masiello announced he would not seek a fourth four-year term. Masiello had run on both major party lines for his final two terms and had twice endorsed Republican Governor George Pataki. During his tenure, the city population and industrial tax base had decreased. Six candidates, including Brown, entered the race to replace him, with Brown accumulating many endorsements and the backing of organized labor.\n\n  described helping Brown win the Mayoral race as his \"biggest campaign priority\" in the last month and a half before Primary Day. Buffalo, which had an 8:1 Democrat to Republican ratio and a 38% black population, was 75% contained in Brown's State Senate district. Brown carried 59% of the vote in the September 13, 2005, Democratic primary. He then went on to face Kevin Helfer, a former City Council colleague, in the general election. Brown was the sixth African-American to win the Democratic Mayor Primary since the 1960s, but all before him had failed to win the general election, even though the city had not elected a Republican since 1961. His Republican opponent, Helfer, beat him in the Conservative Party Primary as a  candidate, although Brown had been endorsed by that party. Brown raised more than five times as much money as Helfer, however, and defeated him 64% to 27% in the general election.\n\n\n\n  and   while Sen.  speaks at Erie Canal Harbor opening ceremony on July 2, 2008.]]\nBrown was sworn in on December 31, 2005, at the . During his first day in office he toured the Buffalo Waterfront to show his commitment to its development. Before the end of the year, restoration on the original point where the  met the  was underway. Brown presented his plans for the development during subsequent tours by top state leaders, including future New York State Governors  and . Erie Canal Harbor eventually opened on July 2, 2008.\n\nIn early 2006, the Seneca Nation filed with the  to build the third of the three Western New York casinos that had been legislated in 2002. In 2007, Brown was not sure he was in favor of the third casino, which seemed to cater to local residents instead of luring tourist revenues. , founder of , former owner of the   franchise and three-time candidate for New York State Governor, suggested that the Buffalo economy would not benefit from a business designed to transfer money from local citizens to the Seneca Gaming Corporation. Brown withheld support while awaiting clarification of the target consumer for the third casino. In October 2006, the Seneca Nation and Brown came to terms on the final sale of a two-block stretch of city road that runs amid the  construction site. As part of the sale the nation agreed to both marketing terms (regarding marketing beyond the local region), and hiring preferences for city residents. However, in January 2007, a federal judge ruled that the granting of permission to run the third casino by the  was improper. Seneca Nation received federal approval for their casino on July 2, 2007, and opened the following day.\n\n\nBrown was one of the original 15 mayors from United States cities such as Washington, Dallas, Philadelphia, Seattle and Milwaukee who convened at a meeting hosted by  and  at  to confirm their support for more serious attacks on the use of illegal firearms. Bloomberg and , the mayor of , were the only Republicans. The mayors all signed a six-point \"statement of principles\" focused on punishing gun possession \"to the maximum extent of the law\", prosecuting dealers who knowingly sell guns to criminals through so-called rs, opposing two  bills to restrict cities' access to gun-tracing data, endorsing technologies to detect illegal guns, and coordinating strategies and outreach to other cities in hopes of reconvening with at least 50 mayors by year end. A little over a year later the  co-chaired by Bloomberg and Menino included 225   leaders in pursuit of legal, political and media strategies to stem gun crime and had a stated goal of \"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets\". Brown noted that he learned several techniques that became useful in Buffalo in reducing the  rate 21% from the coalition and talks with specific mayors.  Rising homicides had been a disappointment in his first year as mayor.\n\nBrown's first-year review as a mayor was mixed.  He was praised for his overhaul of city hall, his follow through on projects and systems, and his influence on statewide redistribution, but he was dogged by crime issues and his efforts for the planned casino.  His agenda, hiring and discipline were respected, but rising homicides, continuing decay and evolving bureaucracy were troubling.  In addition to public perceptions, Brown had a good working relationship with the .\n\n.]]\nAs mayor of Buffalo, he presided over emergency relief from blizzards such as the mid-October 2006 two-foot snow storm. The storm more than doubled the previous record for single-day October snowfall. Despite the fact that about 200,000 city residents were without electricity, the city saw no spike in criminal activity, according to Brown.\n\nBuffalo is second only to  among cities nationwide in terms of percentage of vacant properties per capita. Therefore, in fall 2007, Brown committed to a $100&nbsp;million five-year plan to demolish 5,000 houses, which is about half of the city's total of vacant houses. However, since Buffalo has the second highest residential poverty rate (to ) homes continue to be abandoned. The program may benefit the city because abandoned house costs it an approximate average of $20,060 over five years in lost taxes, debris removal, inspections, and policing. Also, 41% of all fires in Buffalo are in vacant buildings, and more than 90% of all arson cases involved abandoned houses. Subsequently, during the first ever \"State of Upstate Address\", New York Governor Spitzer suggested committing $100&nbsp;million in state funds to build or rehabilitate 10,000 homes and apartments. The mayor's initial demolition plans met with resistance from preservationists and he had to negotiate with the , which got him attention from coast to coast.\n\nIn 2008, Brown convinced Buffalo to use a real-time wireless video surveillance system.  The city installed 56 Avrio Rapid Deployment Surveillance Solution PoleCams.  The system was the result of a request by Brown that the city evaluate surveillance cameras in other cities.  By January 2009 State of the City Address, Brown reported that crime had fallen 12% and homicide by 50% since he had taken office.\n\n\n\nOn June 13, 2008, upon the death of  Washington Bureau Chief and '''' moderator , who was a proud Buffalo native, Brown ordered that all flags on city property be lowered to  in order to honor Russert's memory. Brown called Russert one of Buffalo's finest ambassadors, and his decision to lower the flags in honor of Russert, a civilian who never held elected office, was an unusual gesture that was described as breathtaking on '''' by . He was joined by several other officials in recognizing Russert.  Chief among those was   who signed a bill that named a stretch of  that passes in front of  (home stadium of the ) Timothy J. Russert Highway.\n\nIn a public relations controversy, Brown got caught in a fight against the movement to replace traditional lawns with front yard gardens. His office had issued an edict that a resident remove her landscape renovations. However, an e-mail campaign in defense of the resident caused the mayor to rethink his stance.\n\nIn 2019 Buffalo won the , an award presented annually to the Upstate New York city that had the largest snowfall the previous winter. Brown refused to claim the Golden Snowball Trophy from the mayor of the previous winner, Syracuse, because he \"did not see the contest as 'a real contest'\".\n\n\n\nOn September 15, 2009, Brown won the Democratic Primary for a second term by a nearly two to one margin over City council member .   Brown had amassed an early lead amongst voters until several scandals involving former basketball star Leonard Stokes, including the questionable government support of his failed \"One Sunset\" restaurant and a perceived undue influence in mitigating Stokes's arrest for possessing a stolen  permit, cut away most of his lead.  There were no Republican, third-party or independent candidates, so Brown ran unopposed and won the general election.\n\n\nBrown and Erie County Democratic Party chairman Leonard Lenihan were at odds over various political positions after Lenihan played a major role in Brown's election to the office of mayor. Brown supported  for  in the 2006 general election,  for  in the 2006 general election and  for 60th District New York Senator in a special election on February 28, 2006. Lenihan disagreed with each of these choices. Thompson had run Brown's last common council campaign, and Brown was upset that he did not get to select his successor in the 60th District. Many supporters considered ing the special election due to a perceived racial slight against an African American who seemed to be wrongfully shutout of the process. Lenihan pointed out that neither of the previous state senators turned mayor,  and , was granted the right to pick their successor, and he noted that Thompson had not been timely in entering the special election process. The Erie and  County Democratic committees bypassed Thompson as their nominee in favor of  despite Brown's backing in the February special election. Thompson subsequently decided to run for the New York Senate seat in the November general election.\n\nThe week before the 2006 New York State Democratic Convention, Brown was described as a political confidant of Democratic New York Attorney General candidate Andrew Cuomo. He seconded Cuomo's nomination at the convention on May 30, 2006. Throughout the campaign Brown was described as a close political advisor to Cuomo. He was noted as (along with ) one of the important black political leaders that Cuomo courted on his road to victory.\n\nDuring the , like most of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a supporter of , the  from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported  from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the . In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5&nbsp;million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, '''' alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat  in the New York State Assembly.\n\nAs  resigned her United States Senate seat on January 21, 2009, to assume a position in the  under  ,  New York Governor  was required to appoint a temporary replacement until a special election in 2010 for the balance of her term. Some thought that the New York State Governor would appoint a minority senator such as Brown, , , ,  or . However, Andrew Cuomo was the front-runner for the seat and the next most likely candidates were Velázquez, ,  and Meeks. Prominent women who were mentioned include  and . ''The New York Times'''s Danny Hakim noted that Cuomo, Paterson and Brown were the three names most often mentioned prior to Paterson's ascension to the governor's office.  Although these three were the favorites, Brown was considered an unknown outside of Western New York.  Nonetheless, Brown's name was mentioned before Kennedy's and Cuomo's in a ''New York Times'' article paragraph about Paterson's final nomination decision thoughts.  In fact, in at least one article in ''The New York Times'' on the subject, Brown was mentioned and Cuomo wasn't.  When Paterson announced he had selected  , Brown was one of the few contenders to attend the event.\n\nWhen Andrew Cuomo ran for governor during the , Brown was mentioned in early 2010 as a possible  candidate by numerous sources, including multiple journalists from ''The New York Times''.  Meanwhile, in early 2010, newly transplanted New Yorker  considered challenging New York's junior United States senator, , in the  and met with Brown as part of his statewide political travels.\n\n\n\n\nBrown was elected to a third and fourth term, winning handily in both elections. Among some of his most notable actions during these terms include successfully lobbying for a replacement for the  and announcing changes to the  following an  during the . He also oversaw a period of development after the passing of the  program.\n\nHe was a close political ally of former  .\n\nIn 2016, Brown spearheaded The Unified Development Ordinance, also known as the Buffalo Green Code, which eliminated minimum parking standards in the city's zoning regulations.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Brown campaigned for an unprecedented fifth term, but was defeated in the Democratic primary on June 23, 2021, by . During the primary campaign, Brown refused to participate in debates. While initially low key in his fundraising efforts, he was supported by a number of wealthy donors late into his campaign.\n\nAfter his defeat in the primary, Brown announced that he would run as a write-in candidate in the general election. Since the Erie County Democratic Party has supported India Walton following her victory in the Democratic Party primary, Brown increasingly relied on support from local Republican officials and right-wing organizations which were opposed to Walton, including to assist with collecting signatures for a place on the general election ballot.  On August 17, 2021, Brown's campaign submitted approximately 3,000 signatures in order to appear on the ballot as an independent, with the party label \"Buffalo Party.\"  The Erie County Board of Elections initially ruled the petitions invalid, and Brown sued for ballot access. However, on September 16, 2021, state and federal courts ruled against Brown, meaning that he would not appear on the 2021 general election ballot and would instead continue his campaign as a write-in candidate. During the November 2 general election, Brown was re-elected after winning 58.8% of the vote as a write-in candidate. Brown declared his surprise victory as \"one of the greatest comeback stories in our history.\" Brown had focused his campaign on rejecting the supposed radical views of Walton while stressing his own moderate credentials. He stated his victory was \"a rebuke of , [...] a rebuke of socialism\", issues that his opponent India Walton ran on.\n\nBrown received general election endorsements from  ,  members Joseph Golombek, , and Ulysees Wingo, former mayor of Buffalo , the  of '''', and the local, county, and state .\n\n\nBrown held a press conference on September 30, 2024, where he announced his intention to resign from office in order to accept a job as president and CEO of Western Regional Off-Track Betting. His resignation took effect on October 15. , the president of the Buffalo Common Council, will serve as acting mayor until the regularly scheduled mayoral election in November 2025.\n\n\nByron Brown is married to the former Michelle Austin and they have a son, Byron III, who is referred to as Byron Jr. by some accounts. Brown III enjoys basketball and has attended high-level youth basketball camps. He played for .

In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by  CEO  that his company would not seek new business in Iran.\n\nIn February 2018, the  Prime Minister  stated that \"there were Jewish perpetrators\" of the , \"not only German perpetrators.\" Lauder condemned Morawiecki's comment as anti-Semitic, saying: \"The Polish prime minister [Morawiecki] has displayed appalling ignorance with his unconscionable claim that so-called 'Jewish perpetrators' were partly responsible for the Nazi German attempt to wipe out European Jewry ... this government is going to extreme and unfathomable lengths to exonerate some of their countrymen's own complicity in the murders of their neighbors. This is nothing short of an attempt to falsify history, that is one of the very worst forms of anti-Semitism and Holocaust obfuscation. We demand an immediate retraction and apology from the Polish government of these absurd and offensive remarks.\".\n\nin 2019, Lauder launched the Antisemitism Accountability Project (ASAP) to fund campaigns fighting federal, state, and local candidates who support or promote antisemitism.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported in October 2023 that Lauder announced he was no longer providing financial resources to the University of Pennsylvania over antisemitism concerns following the terrorist group Hamas attacking Israel.\n\n\nLauder had donated $1.1 million in 2016 to  (SAN).

In the proposal he proposed to be the intermediary in the transaction which Denmark rejected.  His involvement was first reported in a 2022 book ''The Divider'' by  and his wife .\n\nHis brother supported 's successful campaign for New York governor in 2022, but Ronald himself gave $11 million to the Republican challenger .\n\n\nLauder has repeatedly come to the defense of Israel in public and is seen as an ally of Prime Minister . In May 2012, he reacted \"with dismay\" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were \"illegal\" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians \"impossible\". Lauder said: \"Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical.

Rangel had the backing of the other Democratic power bases, however, and won the primary by a 3–to–1 margin and the general election easily.\n\nRangel won re-election every two years until his retirement, usually with over 90 percent of the vote and often with more than 95 percent.Barone and Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2008'', p. 1169. In a number of elections Rangel received the backing of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the . Rangel's consistent appeal to his constituents has been due to the perception of him as a champion for justice not just in Harlem but elsewhere in the world. He did face a mid-career primary challenge in 1994 when two-term New York City Councilman  was his opponent and held Rangel to 58 percent of the vote. Rangel then faced strong primary challenges from 2010 on during and after his ethics troubles.\n\n,which Rangel had represented until 2013]]\nHis district was numbered the Eighteenth District from 1971 to 1973; the Nineteenth District from 1973 to 1983; the Sixteenth District from 1983 to 1993; and the Fifteenth from 1993 to 2013. Early 1970s' reapportionment led to the area that Rangel represented being only 65 percent black,''Current Biography Yearbook 1984'', p. 339. and by 1979 it was 50 percent non-Hispanic black, 30 percent white, and 20 percent . By 2000, only 3 in 10 district residents were non-Hispanic blacks, while nearly half were , with many of the newcomers being Dominican.Barone and Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2008'', p. 1170. Subsequently, numbered the Thirteenth, Rangel's area of representation showed a 2-to-1 preponderance of Hispanics over non-Hispanic African Americans.\n\nRangel was an original member when the  was formed in 1971. In 1974, he was elected its chairman and he served in that role until 1976. He remained a member of the caucus for the duration of his time in office.\n\n;Committee assignments\n*'''''' (1975–2017; Ranking member 1996–2006; Chair 2007–2010 [leave of absence for part of 2010])\n*'''''' (Chair 2007, 2009; Vice Chair 2008, 2010 [until left Ways and Means chair])\n* (1976–1993; Chair 1983–1993)\n* (1971–1973)\n* (1971–1974)\n\n;Caucus memberships\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n in 1971]]\nAs a freshman representative Rangel focused on the issue of drugs and was a member of the . In February 1971, he criticized the  for not taking stronger action against Turkey and France, the source and manufacture points for most of the heroin coming into the U.S. His proposal to halt foreign aid to countries not cooperating in the effort against international drug trafficking was unsuccessful, but led to a bill authorizing the president to reduce aid to those countries. Rangel created controversy in New York City by accusing some members of the  of cooperating with drug pushers.\n\nOn April 14, 1972, Rangel and  interfered in the investigation of , who was fatally shot in a Harlem  mosque where  used to preach. Before a suspect could be taken into custody, Farrakhan and Rangel arrived at the scene, saying a riot would likely occur if the suspect and others were not released. Some police department officials also limited the investigation, including deputy commissioner for public affairs , who had ordered all white officers away from the scene in acquiescing to the demands of Farrakhan and Rangel.\n\nDespite an initial impression that Rangel was mostly concerned with the \"ghetto problems\" of drugs and welfare, Rangel focused on many other issues. He consistently backed Israel, including objecting to an anti-Israeli resolution adopted at the  in 1972 and urging black Americans to support the  in 1975.  In other respects Rangel opposed foreign interventions and military spending, voting against bombing in , and against funding for the  and s.\n\nIn Congress one of Rangel's first committee assignments was on the ; during the  he participated in the 1974 . Rangel received both national attention and respect for his well-informed questioning style during the hearings. Rangel was also prominent in questioning Governor Rockefeller on his role in handling the  during Rockefeller's vice presidential confirmation hearing.\n\nRangel rose rapidly in the House, due to his political skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner. In 1974, he became the first African American ever named to the , a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee) and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important . In 1976, he was named to the . By 1979, he was a member of the influential . He combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises.  Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican  on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the .  In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem.  Rangel said of himself, \"I guess I'm practical, but you have to live with yourself and make sure you are not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself.\"\n\nBesides his increasing influence in Washington, by the late 1970s Rangel was New York City's leading black political figure.  After initially endorsing  in the , he endorsed  over  in the Democratic primary run-off.''Current Biography Yearbook 1984'', p. 340. He attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive. As Koch related, \"He has told some blacks angry with me: 'You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? I want you to know he's nasty to everybody.' I thought that was rather nice.\"\n\n\n, 1985]]\nIn 1981, Rangel became chairman of the  giving him power in attempting to oppose the 's cuts in . By 1983 he was the third-ranking member on Ways and Means, and worked well with its powerful chairman, . Rangel became a protégé of   who made him  later that year. In the , Rangel supported former Vice President  rather than the primary campaign of .\n\nBy that time Rangel was known as one of the , who along with his old mentor , city and state figure , and future mayor  were the most prominent politicians in Harlem. They broke racial barriers, attained offices once viewed as not possible for black Americans to achieve, and paved the way for many others around the nation. As  they would dominate public life in Harlem for a generation.\n\nRangel endorsed Koch for re-election in 1981; by 1983 his relationship with the mayor had fallen apart: \"I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he sit down with the mayor.\" By 1984 Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State.''Current Biography Yearbook 1984'', p. 337. His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development,  needs, , and shelters for the homeless. Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best case even House Speaker. Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.\n\nIn 1983, Rangel became chair of the Select Committee on Narcotics solidifying his position as a leading strategist on an issue perennially important to him.  Rangel kept the committee going in the face of usual pressure to disband special committees. He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, advocating for increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement and were included in the . He traveled to countries in Central and South America and other places to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; '''' magazine termed Rangel \"a front-line general in the war against drugs.\" Rangel said \"We need outrage!\", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of , heroin, , and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. He believed that legalizing drugs would represent \"moral and political suicide\". He did not refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that s were so stupid they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. By 1988, Rangel was saying that President  had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady 's \"\" campaign had been quite valuable. The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. '''' said Rangel was \"in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation's agenda\". He would remain as chair of the committee through 1993,''Black Americans in Congress 1870–2007'', pp. 780–781. when it was abolished along with other House select committees.\n\n on the White House .]]\nRangel was part of the  that worked on the , a simplifying overhaul that constituted the most sweeping reform of the  in 50 years. In the negotiations Rangel successfully argued for dropping more lower-income people from the tax rolls; the elimination of six million households from federal income taxation was hailed as a wise policy by both liberal and conservative groups. Rangel authored the  portion of the bill, which increased affordable housing in the U.S. He also played a key role in preserving the deductibility of state and local income taxes. He asserted that while beneficiaries of  were not well organized, business interests opposed to it were. When the conference threatened to break down, he stressed it was vital to reach an agreement.\n\nBy late 1985 Rangel was in a six-person race to become the next , the third-highest ranked position in the House and for the first time up for election by the members rather than appointment by the Speaker. In October 1986 the race was heating up, with Rangel as the underdog coming close to Representative  from California through use of his personal skills and Rangel arguing that the Democratic leadership needed better regional balance. However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the vote for whip, 167–78. Rangel attributed his loss to Coelho having funded the campaigns of many House members via his role as chairman of the , later saying, \"I had never been so goddamn naive. I came to Washington as an experienced politician. How did I miss Coelho's contribution to members?\"\n\nIn December 1984, Rangel was arrested for participating in an  rally in front of the South African Consulate in New York. Rangel successfully pushed to have s removed for corporations doing business in that country, a 1987 act that became known as the \"Rangel Amendment\".  A number of companies left South Africa as a result, and the amendment proved to be one of the more effective anti-apartheid sanctions.  The bill won praise from  and Rangel later said was one of his actions that he was most proud of.\n\n\nDuring the 1991 , Rangel demanded that   investigate allegations of discrimination from black members of the  regarding combat training and treatment. During the , Rangel battled with executive branch officials over budget items almost as much as he had during Republican administrations, and always resented when Clinton negotiated directly with Republicans while bypassing congressional Democrats. In 1993, however, Rangel was a key sponsor of increases to the  that passed.\n\nRangel's dream of becoming chairman of Ways and Means took a tumble with the  of 1994, which took control of the House away from the Democrats for the first time in decades.  He did become the ranking Democrat of the committee in 1996. Rangel was bitterly opposed to the Republican , considering it an assault on America's poor, and strongly criticized Democrats such as President  and religious leaders such as  for perpetuating \"the silence of good people\" that he likened to what happened in . When Rangel made a similar allusion directed at new Ways and Means chair  in 1995, Archer refused to speak to him for several years except at public meetings.Barone and Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2008'', p. 1171. Rangel also strongly opposed the , accusing Clinton of supporting it for political reasons and predicting its consequences would cast a million children into poverty.\n\nOpening up economic opportunities for minorities and the poor was a focus of Rangel's during the 1990s. His 1993 legislation created \"s\", which provided tax incentives for investment and job creation in inner urban areas; it would eventually account for $5 billion in federal spending across the nation's cities.  Rangel played a specific role in the creation of the 1995 , which led to a $500 million spending of public and private monies towards changing the face of Harlem, including gentrification effects. Rangel served on the corporation's board, and the effort was credited with helping the resurgence of Harlem that took place during the 1990s.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, Rangel led an outreach effort on behalf of the  that sought to gain African American votes for white candidates in key swing districts. The project may have helped gain or keep several seats during the .\n \nIn late 1998, when long-time Senator  of New York announced his retirement, Rangel was one of the first to advocate that   move to New York and run for the seat. She did so successfully.\n\nOn March 15, 1999, the congressman was arrested along with two other prominent African American leaders (civil rights activist  and former  ) for protesting the fatal shooting of , a 23-year-old immigrant to the United States from Guinea, by four  and Hispanic New York City police officers. The officers involved were later acquitted by a mixed-race jury.\n\nIn October 1998,   filed a lawsuit charging the directors of the foundation behind New York's , including foundation chair Rangel, with failing to collect more than $4 million owed it by a company controlled by Percy Sutton that produced the television program ''''. The suit sought the removal of Rangel; after months of indecision, Rangel stepped down as chair but remained on the board. In October 1999, new Attorney General  dismissed the lawsuit and cleared Rangel and Sutton of any wrongdoing, saying that all monies properly owed had changed hands.  Rangel expressed bitterness over the year-long episode, saying \"I shouldn't have had to go through this.\"\n\n\n in 2004]]\nDuring the early 2000s Rangel advocated continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including  and . Rangel also had an unproductive relationship with Ways and Means chairman , leading to an incident in which Thomas called the  on Rangel for having his members read a bill in the library, an action for which Thomas apologized.\n\nRangel sponsored the , passed in 2000, despite the opposition of labor unions, the textile industry, and the Congressional Black Caucus. For the first time incentives were provided for U.S. trade with . Indeed, Rangel became known for support of  agreements, in contrast to many House Democrats.\n\nFollowing the , Rangel helped secure an extension to unemployment benefits. His intent was to help those in New York industries affected by the events.\n\nMotivated by seeing few African American diplomats on his trips abroad, he founded the  in 2002. The program is a collaboration between  and the  that has significantly increased the number of minorities working in the .\n\nIn July 2004, Rangel was the first of three sitting U.S. House members to be arrested on  charges, for protesting  in front of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington ( and  would follow). Rangel said, \"When human lives are in jeopardy, there should be outrage.\"\n\nRangel was an adamant opponent of the  and of the .  Feeling powerless to stop the latter in the Republican-controlled Congress, he said in 2007 that he had suffered from nightmares: \"It was my lowest point ever in my 37 years in Congress ... It was a sad period where you saw lives being lost [in the war] and you couldn't do anything about it.\"\nIn April 2006, Rangel and nine other representatives joined ' action against George W. Bush and others, alleging violations of the  in the passing of the . '''' was dismissed later that year for .\n\nRangel has been long been opposed to the all-volunteer army and repeatedly called for the government to bring back  (military conscription). In 2003, Rangel said that \"A disproportionate number of the poor and members of minority groups make up the enlisted ranks of the military, while the most privileged Americans are underrepresented or absent\", and that a draft would make the military more representative of the American public at large. While some observers saw the logic in what Rangel was saying, his proposals attracted little organized support from either party or from antiwar organizations. During 2006 Rangel said that no soldier would be fighting in Iraq if they had decent career possibilities and stating:\n\n\n\nRangel introduced versions of his  in the House in 2003, , 2007, and 2010. Polls showed 70&nbsp;percent of Americans opposed a reinstatement of the draft. Rangel emphasized that people could fulfill their draft obligations through non-military services, such as port and airline security. The one time the act came up for a vote in the full House, in 2004, it was defeated 2–402, with Rangel voting against his own bill in protest at the procedural handling of it.\n\nIn June 2006, the  passed a $3&nbsp;million  to establish the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at . By 2007 the amount had been reduced to $2&nbsp;million, but the funding for the center, whose purpose was to bring more poor and minority students into politics, was the target of criticism from Representative  of California and other Republicans as an abuse of the earmark process and as Rangel's \"Monument to Me\". City College said it was proud to house the center and Rangel said \"I cannot think of anything I am more proud of.\"\n\nIn August 2006, Rangel said he would resign his seat if the Democrats did not take the House that November, a statement that had real intent behind it, as at age 76 Rangel was feeling \"the claustrophobia\" of time.  \n in 2007 under the 's Global Connections and Exchange Program]]\nThe Democrats did take control and in January 2007, Rangel's long wait to head the Ways and Means Committee was over.  Not only was he the first African American to do so, but he was also the first New Yorker to chair the committee since  in the 1870s. As holder of one of the most powerful posts in Congress, he said the chairmanship \"couldn't have come any later for me\".  Age was not otherwise a factor with Rangel, who worked a scheduled 16 hours a day and looked a good deal younger than he was. '''' magazine termed Rangel's ascent to the chairmanship \"a watershed moment for African-Americans, who historically have been shut out when it comes to deciding how to divvy up the trillions of dollars in the federal government's budget\". Rangel was able to establish an effective working relationship with ranking member .Barone and Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2008'', p. 1172.\n\nIn April 2007, Rangel published his autobiography, ''... And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since: From the Streets of Harlem to the Halls of Congress'', whose title reflected his experience in Korea.  '''' gave it a favorable reviewing, saying it was \"mercifully short on laundry lists [that some other political memoirs have], but long on sass and spirit\".\n\nRangel was an early and strong supporter of  for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking a shot at the marital histories of former Mayor of New York , then the Republican front-runner, and his wife , resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. As events in 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator . Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying \"There's just no question in my mind that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain't no time for a beginner.\" (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2008, '''' reported that Rangel was soliciting donations to the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York from corporations with business interests before his Ways and Means Committee, and was doing so using Congressional . The companies and individuals included , , and , and by this time Rangel's efforts had helped raise $12&nbsp;million of the $30&nbsp;million goal for the center. Government watchdog groups and ethics experts criticized Rangel's actions, with the dean of the  saying Rangel \"has crossed the line\".\n\nRangel denied any wrongdoing and asked the , commonly known as the House Ethics Committee, to determine if his use of Congressional  while arranging meetings to solicit contributions for the center had violated any House rules. House Speaker  agreed to Rangel's request.\n\n\n'''' reported in July 2008 that Rangel rents four apartments at below-market rates in the Lenox Terrace complex in Harlem. It reported that Rangel paid $3,894 monthly for all four apartments in 2007. In contrast, the landlord's going rate for similar apartments in the building was as high as $8,125 monthly. Three adjacent apartments were combined to create his  home. A fourth unit is used as a campaign office, which violates city and state regulations that require  apartments to be used as a primary residence. Rangel received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from one of the landlords, according to the paper. Rangel said his rent does not affect his representation of his constituents.\n\nCongressional ethics experts said the difference in rent between what Rangel was paying and market rates, an estimated $30,000 per year, could be construed as a gift, exceeding the $100 House of Representatives gift limit.Kocieniewski, David. , ''The New York Times'', July 11, 2008.  In late July, the House voted 254–138 to  a resolution by Republican Minority Leader  that would have censured Rangel for having \"dishonored himself and brought discredit to the House\", by occupying the four apartments.\n\n\nA September 2008 '''' article reported that Rangel had been using a House parking garage as free storage space for his  for years, in apparent violation of Congressional rules. Under  regulations, free parking (here, worth $290 a month) is considered , and must be declared on s.  In July 2010 the House Ethics Committee ruled that Rangel had committed no violation, since in practice the parking policy was only applied to Congressional staff and not to members themselves.\n\n\nRangel was accused of failing to report income from his rental of a beachside villa he owns in  in the .  A three-bedroom, three-bath unit, it has rented out for as much as $1,100 per night in the busiest tourist season.\n\nLabor lawyer , a principal investor in the resort development company and frequent campaign contributor to Rangel, had encouraged him to purchase the villa. Rangel purchased it in 1988 for $82,750. He financed $53,737.50 of the purchase price for seven years at an interest rate of 10.5%, but was one of several early investors whose interest payments were waived in 1990.\n\nIn September 2008, Rangel's attorney, , disclosed that Rangel had failed to report on his tax returns or in congressional disclosure forms $75,000 in income he had received for renting his Dominican villa. That month, Rangel paid $10,800 to cover his liability for the related . The New York Times, Published: September 19, 2008 He had owed back taxes for at least three years. The Ways and Means Committee writes the , and as such his failure to pay taxes himself led to heavy criticism.\n\nA September 14, 2008, ''New York Times'' editorial called for Rangel to step down temporarily from his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee while his ethical problems were investigated.\n\nOn September 24, 2008, the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate whether Rangel had violated its  or any law or other regulation related to his performance of his duties. On November 23, 2008, the '''' reported that Rangel took a \"\" tax break on his Washington, D.C., house for years, while simultaneously occupying multiple New York City rent-stabilized apartments, \"possibly violating laws and regulations in both cases\". In January 2009, Republican Representative  introduced the Rangel Rule Act of 2009 (H.R. 735), a  proposal that would have allowed all taxpayers to not pay penalties and interest on back taxes, in reference to Rangel not yet having paid his.\n\n\n, in Bermuda in 2009]]\nIn November 2008, following reports by ''The New York Times'', Republican Congressmen asked the House Ethics Committee to look into Rangel's defense of a  approved by his Ways and Means Committee. One of the four companies that benefited from the loophole was , which opened headquarters in  as a foreign corporation.Kocieniewski, David.  ''The New York Times'', November 25, 2008. Under the loophole Nabors received tens of millions of dollars in s. In 2004, Rangel had led opposition to the tax breaks.  Nabors donated $1 million in 2006, and $100,000 later, to the City College of New York school named after Rangel.\n\nIts CEO said the donations were unrelated to Rangel's February 2007 promise to oppose closing the loophole. He denied there was any '''', and called the article about it \"malarkey\".  Rangel said ''The New York Times'' had ignored facts and explanations, and denied the charges.Kocieniewski, David, \"\", ''The New York Times'', November 25, 2008.   The House Ethics Committee voted in December 2008, to expand its investigation of Rangel to the matter.  Eventually the Ethics Committee would not make a specific charge over this matter but did include it in the supporting documentation for the overall charge that Rangel had solicited Rangel Center donations from those with business before his committee.\n\n\nOn September 15, 2008, it was disclosed that: (a) Rangel had omitted from his financial reports details regarding his sale of a Washington, D.C. home; (b) discrepancies existed in the values he listed for a property he owns in  (varying from $50,000 to $500,000); and (c) inconsistencies appeared in his  reporting.  He apologized, saying \"I owed my colleagues and the public adherence to a higher , not only as a member of Congress, but even more as the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.\"  Republicans called for his removal as chair.  Rangel said there was no justification for that, as the mistakes were errors of omission, that would not justify loss of his position.\n\nIn August 2009, Rangel amended his 2007 financial disclosure form to report more than $500,000 in previously unreported assets and income. That doubled his reported . Unreported assets included a  checking account of between $250,000 and $500,000, several investment accounts, stock in  and , and property in . Rangel also had not paid es on two of his New Jersey properties which he was required by law to do.\n\nThe ethics issues led by December 2008 to some loss of standing for Rangel, to Republicans trying to tie him to all Democrats, and to some Democrats privately saying it would be best if Rangel stepped down from his Ways and Means post. \nIn late 2008 and again in September 2009, the government   named Rangel one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress. Media pieces compared Rangel's woes with those unethical former Ways and Means chairs  and . Pelosi, a long-time friend of Rangel's, withheld any possible action against Rangel pending the House Ethics Committee report. Rangel evinced impatience with that body, saying \"I don't have a complaint now, except that it's taking too goddamn long to review this thing and report back.\"\nOn September 3, 2009, '''' called on Rangel to resign his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force him out of his chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the  (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.\n\n\nIn May 2009, the non-profit  filed an ethics complaint against Rangel and other members of Congress for trips, taken in 2007 and 2008 to . The trips had been sponsored by Carib News Foundation, a New York non-profit funded by corporations with interests before Congress and the Ways and Means Committee. This combined with the duration of the trips seemed to violate House rules. The Ethics Committee agreed the following month to investigate the matter.\n\nOn February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee issued its report. It determined that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his travel to the conferences. The committee found that he had not known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying:\n\n\n\nPelosi said she would not take any action against Rangel pending further committee findings, as his staff had been more at fault and he had not broken any law. The Ethics Committee continued to investigate the charges against Rangel relating to obtaining rent-stabilized apartments, fundraising, and failure to disclose rental income from his Dominican villa.\n\n\nAfter a February 2010 House Ethics Committee report criticizing him for taking sponsored Caribbean trips, the White House backed off its prior support of Rangel somewhat, and within days 14 Democratic members of Congress publicly called on Rangel to step aside as Ways and Means chair. Other Democrats were concerned that Rangel would impede Democrats' efforts to maintain their majority in the , but did not say anything publicly out of respect and personal affection for Rangel. \nMomentum quickly built against Rangel, with 30 or more Democrats planning to oppose his continued chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, in a full House vote being pushed by Republicans.  Democrat  of New Hampshire noted:\n\n\n\nOn March 3, 2010, Rangel said he would take a  as chair, pending issuance of the Ethics Committee's report. Pelosi granted his request, but whether such a leave was possible was unclear and the House  said that a resignation had taken place and that Rangel was no longer chair. Observers opined that it was unlikely that Rangel would ever be able to regain the position. Several Democrats said they would return or donate to charity campaign contributions given to them by Rangel. Representative  of Michigan took over as acting chair.\n\n\nOn July 22, 2010, a bipartisan, four-member investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee indicated it had \"substantial reason to believe\" that Rangel had violated a range of ethics rules relating to the other charges. The matter was referred to another, newly created, special subcommittee to rule on the findings. Majority Leader  said the action indicated the \"process is working as it should, while Minority Leader  called the announcement \"a sad reminder\" of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's \"most glaring broken promise: to 'drain the swamp' in Washington\".\n\nRangel negotiated with the Ethics Committee. But participants in the talks characterized him as unwilling to admit wrongdoing in connection with several of the charges, and anxious about preserving his legacy. No settlement was reached.\n\nOn July 29, 2010, Rangel was charged by the committee with 13 counts of violating House rules and federal laws. Rangel's lawyers continued to insist that he had not intentionally violated any law or regulation, had not handed out political favors, and had not misused his office for personal financial gain. Rangel somberly only said this on the day the charges were announced:\n\nSixty years ago, I survived a Chinese attack in North Korea. And as a result I wrote a book that, having survived that, that I haven't had a bad day since. Today I have to reassess that.\n\n\nRangel suggested that 's primary run in the  against incumbent , who was the first African American governor of New York, would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising  primary contest against . At the time McCall was the highest-ranking African American and first major party candidate for governor in the state. Rangel had been a staunch supporter of McCall against Cuomo in 2002.  For the upcoming 2010 gubernatorial race, Rangel suggested that for the white Cuomo to challenge the African American incumbent would not be \"the moral decision\". Rangel said, \"There might be an inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. Since we have most African Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion.\" Paterson fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election. By this point Rangel's continuing difficulties, along with the death a few months prior of  and the failure of Paterson ('s son), marked the end of the era of Harlem's \"\".\n\nRangel faced several Democratic primary challengers for his seat in 2010: , whose  campaign bore many resemblances to Rangel's own against the scandal-plagued , in 1970; , who had previously challenged Rangel in 1994; labor activist and past primary candidate for statewide office ; and former Obama campaign official Joyce Johnson.  While Rangel's fund-raising was down from previous years, and he had paid nearly $2 million in legal fees, he still had far more cash available for the campaign than any of his challengers.\n\nOn September 14, 2010, Rangel prevailed in the primary election, gaining 51&nbsp;percent of the vote against Powell's 23&nbsp;percent and lesser amounts for the other contenders.  He then won the November 2, 2010, general election easily, garnering 80&nbsp;percent of the vote against Republican 's 10&nbsp;percent and smaller amounts for third-party candidates.\n\n\nOn November 15, 2010, Rangel's formal ethics trial began. He walked out of the hearing at the start, saying that he was unable to afford representation after having paid his previous lawyers over $2&nbsp;million, and arguing unsuccessfully that the proceeding should be delayed until he could arrange for a legal defense fund.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, Rangel was found guilty on 11 of the 12 standing charges against him by the adjudicatory subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee.  Two of the charges were focused on his actions with regards to soliciting funds and donations for the Rangel Center from those with business before the Ways and Means Committee; four were for improper use of Congressional letterhead and other House resources in those solicitations; one was for submitting incomplete and inaccurate financial disclosure statements; one was for using one of his Harlem apartments as an office when he had Congressional dealings with the landlord; one was for failing to pay taxes on his Dominican villa; and two reiterated these charges in describing general violations of House rules.\n\nTwo days later, a near-tears Rangel pleaded for \"fairness and mercy\" and he had support from fellow Representative .  But it was to no avail; the full Committee voted 9–1 to recommend that the full House approve  upon Rangel. The committee stated: \"Public office is a public trust [and Rangel] violated that trust.\" Censure is the strongest penalty the House can impose short of outright . The committee also said that Rangel should make restitution for any unpaid taxes.\n\nSupporters of Rangel argued that by comparison with previous cases, a reprimand would be a more fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure.  Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. It was to no avail. On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. Ethics committee chair  emphasized that it was Rangel's \"accumulation of actions\" that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Only two Republicans voted against censure,  of Long Island and  of Alaska. Per custom Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the . Rangel asked to speak and said, \"I know in my heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress. I'll be judged by my life in its entirety.\"\n\n\n in 2011]]\nRepublicans took over control of the House as the  began in January 2011, meaning Rangel would have lost his Ways and Means chair even without his ethics issues. He was not considered for the ranking member slot either, which after a contested election among the Democratic caucus had gone to former acting chair Sander Levin. His difficulties were not completely over; the  filed a complaint with the  alleging that he had improperly paid legal bills from a political action committee. To cover both ongoing and past legal expenses he established a legal defense fund (whose creation was approved by the House Ethics Committee).\n\nHe was the first elected politician to use the now-defunct  mobile app to interact directly with his constituents.\n\nDuring 2011 Rangel became the first member of Congress to declare support for the  movement and made several visits to their nearby demonstration site in . However the protesters themselves picketed Rangel's office, objecting to his free trade stance (in particular to agreements he supported  and  that they said resulted in jobs being exported).\n\nIn early 2012, Rangel was beset by a back injury and a serious viral infection; he was away from Congress for three months.  Moreover, his district had been renumbered as the  following the 2010 census, and its demographics had been changed significantly. He found himself in a district that stretched from Harlem to the Bronx and was now majority-Hispanic; it was 55 percent Hispanic and 27 percent African American. As a result, Rangel faced a serious primary challenge from State Senator . Rangel struggled with fundraising, and he began receiving contributions from fellow members of Congress whom he had helped over the years.  – the real contest in what was still an overwhelmingly Democratic district – Rangel defeated Espaillat by less than a thousand votes,  that took two weeks to fully resolve.  He won the subsequent November general election easily.\n\nIn April 2013, Rangel filed a lawsuit in the  against several members and staff of the House Ethics Committee, saying that they had engaged in \"numerous, flagrant, knowing and intentional violations\" in their investigation against him. The suit sought to overturn the measure of censure that had been taken against him. In December 2013, Judge  dismissed the suit, saying that there were \"insurmountable separation-of-powers barriers\" against the courts becoming involved in House of Representatives internal actions. Rangel appealed the dismissal, but the judge's action was upheld by the  in May 2015, saying the matter fell outside the jurisdiction of the courts. In October 2015, the  declined to consider the case ending Rangel's legal bid.\n\nRangel ran again in 2014, facing Espaillat once more in the Democratic primary as well as Reverend Michael Walrond from the . Rangel said that if he was re-elected, it would be his final term in the House. He lost some of his traditional endorsements, but retained others and campaigned hard even while turning 84 years of age. In the  the voting was again close but Rangel prevailed over Espaillat. Rangel faced no Republican opposition in the November general election and won easily against a minor party candidate, saying as he voted on November 4, \"Today was a historic day and a very emotional day [as] I cast my final vote as a candidate on the ballot...\"\n\nAfter being strongly opposed to 's March 3, 2015, speech to Congress (in which, at the invitation of House Republicans, the Israeli Prime Minister spoke in opposition to the Obama administration's efforts to secure a ) and saying he would be one of those Democrats not attending, Rangel changed his mind and did attend, attributing his reversal to the advice of friends and constituents and saying, \"Enough damage has already been done... I don't want my absence to add to what is already a shattered type of relationship.\"\n\nDue to a large personal loan he made and his continuing struggles with fundraising, Rangel's 2014 re-election campaign debt stood at $140,000 as of June 2015. He engaged in various fundraising efforts during 2015 in an effort to reduce this debt, which brought about some criticism from  that these efforts were not fully transparent. He had planned to raise money towards paying off that debt at his 85th birthday celebration to be held at the  that month. Guests included , , and Hillary Clinton, however Clinton took over Rangel's party as a \"Hillary for America\" event to raise money for .\n in December 2016]]\nAs he had vowed two years earlier, Rangel did not run for re-election in the 2016 election. In the June 2016 Democratic primary election to effectively pick his successor, Rangel supported State Assemblyman  expressing the hope that an African American would continue to represent the district. However Espaillat won a close victory over Wright in a large field of candidates. Underlining the demographic changes that had been taking place, after winning the general election in November Espaillat became the first non-African American to represent Harlem in the House since a series of Harlem-focused congressional districts were formed beginning in the 1940s. Rangel left office at the expiration of his term on January 3, 2017.\n\n\nAfter his retirement, Rangel has been occasionally active in public life. He gave reflective interviews that also commented on the future course of Harlem. He endorsed  in his successful bid to unseat  in  in a 2018 race, and he endorsed  during the .\n\nWhen asked in 2019 whether he had ever witnessed any racist comments made by  prior to his presidency, Rangel said he had not, but added: \"I don't remember any remarks he ever made that was not sharing with me how much he thought about himself. It was always the same story.\"\n\nRangel served as grand marshal of Harlem's  in 2019.  He rode in the parade again in 2022, at age 92, when it resumed following .\n\n\nVarious s have given Rangel scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group.Mayer, William. , '''' March 28, 2004.  \"The question of how to measure a senator's or representative's ideology is one that political scientists regularly need to answer. For more than 30 years, the standard method for gauging ideology has been to use the annual ratings of lawmakers' votes by various interest groups, notably the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and the American Conservative Union (ACU).\" Overall as of 2003, Rangel had an average lifetime 91 percent \"liberal quotient\" from . In contrast, the  assessed to Rangel a lifetime rating of less than 4&nbsp;percent through 2009.  '''' rates congressional votes as  or  on the , in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Rangel's averages were as follows: economic rating 91&nbsp;percent liberal and 6&nbsp;percent conservative, social rating 94&nbsp;percent liberal and 5&nbsp;percent conservative, and foreign rating 84&nbsp;percent liberal and 14&nbsp;percent conservative.Barone and Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2008'', p. 1168.\n\n provides the ratings of many, many lesser known interest groups with respect to Rangel. Rangel typically had 100 ratings from  and \nand, inversely, 0 ratings or close to that from the . \nHe has typically gotten very high ratings in the 90s or 100 from the , the , and the . The  has usually given Rangel around a 90 rating.\n has given Rangel ratings in the middling 40–50 range, while\nthe  has typically given Rangel very low ratings or an 'F' grade.\n\n\n\nRangel is known as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one who is able to gain friendship and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor. He was called \"Charlie\" by everyone in Congress from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees. Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair  said, \"Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is.\" The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called \"Rangeling\" by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts. O'Neill aide  said these members were \"tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent\".\n\nRangel has been described as having a meticulous appearance. Long-time mentor  recalled, \"In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because he was one of those handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.\" Later '''' described him thusly: \"After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally.\" In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. The congressman's life has been dominated by politics with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested when he was being investigated for possible ethics violations and a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's .\n\nRangel has been known for his blunt speaking and candor. When asked how he would like to be remembered, he paraphrased  in '''': \"Well, ... if I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn.\" In any case he has often made controversial remarks.\n\nSome have been linked to his caustic criticism of George W. Bush's administration. Speaking at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, his frustration over  led him to compare Bush to the  , a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, saying: \"George Bush is our Bull Connor.\"  A few days later he said both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President  who said, \"I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me  they were so out of line, it almost struck me that... Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess.\" Rangel responded by saying, \"The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself... He should look so good at seventy-five.\"\nRangel again expressed his displeasure with the vice president in October 2006 – after Cheney had said that \"Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works\" – by opining that Cheney is \"a real son of a bitch\" who \"enjoys a confrontation\" and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects. The White House said that the vice president did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a \"big hearty laugh\" over them.\n \nRangel sometimes seems to find the other side; following the  in which the Venezuelan leader implied that Bush was the devil, Rangel said, \"I want President Chávez to please understand that even though many people in the United States are critical of our president that we resent the fact that he would come to the United States and criticize President Bush... you don't come into my country, you don't come into my congressional district and you don't condemn my president.\"\n\nOther remarks of Rangel's have revolved around Rangel's feelings about his home state and city, such as disparaging the state of MississippiIn November 2006, Rangel, in announcing some of his plans as new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he planned to push more funds into his home state of New York. He added to this, \"Mississippi gets more than their fair share back in federal money, but who the hell wants to live in Mississippi?\" Mississippi Representative  demanded an apology and Rangel issued a statement declaring: \"I certainly don't mean to offend anyone. I just love New York so much that I can't understand why everyone wouldn't want to live here.\" See  \nor suggesting that President Obama and First Lady  might be unsafe if they visited New York.In May 2009, when asked by the '''' what President Obama and First Lady  should do during a visit to New York, Rangel replied, \"Make certain he doesn't run around in East Harlem unidentified.\" Rangel said this following the accidental shooting of African-American  officer Omar Edwards by Caucasian fellow officer Andrew Dunton, an incident of mistaken identity. See  The comment was criticized by New York City Mayor , who said, \"I have a lot of respect for Charlie Rangel, but in this case, he's just plain wrong. This was a tragedy. Our police department is diverse, and they train; sometimes things happen and they're inexplicable. There's no reason to suspect this had any racial overtones.\" See  Rangel soon apologized for the comment, saying, \"It was entirely inappropriate to bring the President and his wife into this discussion during their visit to New York and I hope my off-the-cuff comment did not cause embarrassment to anyone.\" See \nIn both cases apologies from the congressman followed. In certain instances, his remarks only exacerbated his existing problems. When his ethics issues were made public, Rangel remarked that Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee  was \"disabled\".In September 2008 – after spending a week avoiding reporters's questions on his ethics issues, by just giving his  – while being interviewed by  on , Rangel said of Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee , \"You got to be kind to the disabled.\" When Kramer pressed him on whether he really thought she was disabled, Rangel replied, \"There's no question about it politically. It's a nightmare to think that a person's foreign policy is based on their ability to look at Russia from where they live.\"  New York Congressman  demanded that Rangel apologize, especially given that Palin's five-month-old son, Trig, had , saying, \"Charlie owes a sincere apology to Sarah Palin and the entire disabled community. All of us know parents who have disabled children or relatives, so from any perspective this was wrong, wrong, wrong.\" Carr Massi, the president of , also criticized Rangel: \"I am not one of [Palin's] fans, but I don't like the idea he referred to the woman as disabled. I mean he is talking about her politics – that word has no place there.\" Rangel suggested later in an interview with the '''' that his comments were aimed at her thin foreign policy background and dismissed suggestions that he was talking about her newborn son as ridiculous.  The episode prompted '''' to declare that \"Rangel's off the rails.\" See  and  In 2013, he compared the  to segregationists who opposed the Civil Rights Movement and said they could be defeated the same way: \"It is the same group we faced in the South with those white crackers and the dogs and the police. They didn't care about how they looked. It was just fierce indifference to human life that caused America to say enough is enough.\"\n\n\n\nAfter defeating  in the Democratic primary in 1970, Rangel won re-election to represent New York's , , , ,  districts at different times.\n\n\nIn 1986, the  awarded Rangel with the .\n\nRangel was given the 's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.

In response to the pressure he was receiving from other Republicans to vote against the measure, he is quoted as saying:\nYou get to the point where you evolve in your life where everything isn't black and white, good and bad, and you try to do the right thing. You might not like that. You might be very cynical about that. Well, fuck it, I don't care what you think. I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm tired of Republican-Democrat politics.

During the 2010 campaign, he ran on a platform favoring minimal regulation of business and signed the  /  pledge of \"no new taxes under any circumstances\".\n\n\nFollowing the resignation of Anthony Weiner, Turner ran for the vacant seat in  held on September 13, 2011beating his Democratic opponent, , by a margin of more than 4,000 votes. His campaign consultant was strategist . Turner's campaign ran ads showing images of the  in flames, accusing Weprin of commemorating the attack by defending the right of Sufi Muslims to build the Islamic community center . Turner also said that Weprin would merely toe the Democratic Party line if elected and emphasized that Weprin had said the national debt was $4 trillion when the correct number was $14 trillion. Turner, according to the ''New York Times'', \"aggressively courted observant Jewish voters\", and painted Weprin as a puppet of President Obama, who would not stand up for Israel. Turner won strong support from Orthodox Jewish leaders, and won crossover endorsements, two key ones being New York Assemblyman , and former New York Mayor , both Democrats and Jews.\n\nTurner began the campaign with a disadvantage in fundraising because the national and state Republican parties had spent heavily in previous special elections in New York state. Turner turned down  support and offers to help during his special election campaign. Regardless, Turner rose in the polls from an underdog to an eight-point advantage days before the election. The Democratic Party contributed heavily to Weprin in the last weeks of the race, as Turner's odds of winning increased. Turner's win was publicized as a large upset victory, and made national headlines because Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 3-to-1 in the district. His win was also unexpected because his district had a large Jewish constituency (up to one quarter of registered voters are Jewish), and Turner beat Weprin, an Orthodox Jew, with a majority of the Jewish vote.\n\nTurner's campaign manager, E. O'Brien Murray, was later named 2012 GOP campaign manager of the year, by the  for his role in the win. The district is Democratic leaning with a  (CPVI) of D+5. In ''Salon'', which called Turner's win \"unremarkable\", it was argued that the district had been leaning rightward, as it was one of the few districts in the nation in which  performed one point worse than  in 2004 and 12 points worse than  in 2000. However, ''Salon''s claims were questioned by some as Obama had won the district in 2008 by 11 points and Kerry by 12 in 2004, which did not seem to imply a strong conservative swing. Furthermore, the local city council seat was easily won by a Democrat in the most recent election, along with the local State Senate and Assembly seats. This included a special election for  on the same day as Turner's election, within his congressional district, where the Democratic candidate won with 76% of the vote. Additionally,  easily won the district during his run for Governor of New York.\n\n\nOne of Turner's campaign themes was fiscal recovery through cuts in federal spending. He opposed what Democrats said were Republican plans to privatize Medicare and Social Security and turn Medicaid into a block-grant program, reportedly at the request of former New York mayor , who supported him. In endorsing Turner's opponent, ''The New York Times'' said that Turner's economic plan to reduce taxes without reducing benefits for current Medicare and Social Security recipients was unrealistic. \"That would take a magician, not a businessman\", said the Times. One month before the election, Turner admitted that an op-ed he written for the '''' calling for a one third reduction in federal spending and \"an end to government dependencies\" was \"blatant pandering\" to \"a particular audience\".\n\nDuring his 2011 campaign, Turner stated he came out of retirement to run for Congress \"to fix what's broken and go home. End subsidies. End government dependencies. Dramatically cut the budget by 30 or 35 percent. Slash capital-gains taxes down to zero. Cut taxes across the board. The rest of America's economic healing will happen naturally as a consequence\", he said.  In 2011 he chose not to sign \"the pledge,\" citing the need to compromise in the critical area of reducing the debt. In his 2011 campaign he cited illegal immigration as a major cause of U.S. unemployment. To resolve the U.S. debt, he proposed eliminating the U.S Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency and reducing the size of the Department of Education.\n\n\n, where he argued for the elimination of its tolls]]\nTurner was sworn in on September 15, 2011. He was mentored by Homeland Security Committee chair  (R-NY) in his transition to his new job. Turner met with his former rival, Anthony Weiner, discussing open constituent files and issues facing the district, including noise pollution and eroding beaches. He had a cordial and businesslike meeting with Weiner, though the two men have been described as polar opposites.\n\nWithin weeks of taking office, Turner was attacked by the  (DCCC) for his no new tax pledge, and painted by the DCCC as representing wealthy individuals and corporations rather than the average district voter. Turner expressed support for  in upstate New York, and would allow states to opt out of . Remarking on the tenth anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Turner said he would \"leave our military commitment in Afghanistan up to the generals in the field,\" adding that, \"If they believe the sacrifice of our soldiers continues to be necessary to prevent attacks on U.S. soil, then we have no choice but to let them finish the task.\" Turner was an advocate for removing the tolls on the , and applauded Gov. Cuomo for his motions towards changing the policy.\n\nIn November 2011, a protester affiliated with the  movement shouted during Turner's ceremonial swearing-in. Turner then criticized the OWS demonstrators as socialist and praised America's capitalist system as a \"beacon to the world\". Turner voted for Paul Ryan's revised  in 2012, despite reluctance that it would privatize . Turner promised during his campaign to protect Social Security, and explicitly said he would vote no to the Ryan plan. Turner's spokesman defended his vote for the bill, saying Turner was opposed to many of its provisions, but believed it was a good starting point for negotiations because it would not be finalized without compromise with the Democratic-controlled Senate. However, Turner did suggest raising the minimum age from 65.\n\nTurner introduced The TEACH Act of 2012, which would provide a  of up to $5,000 per year to families who send their children to non-public K-12 schools. Congressman Turner has said his goal with the TEACH Act is to ameliorate the “double taxation” burdening on parents paying for local school taxes and private schooling tuition. His proposal received wide support from the , Yeshiva congregations in Queens, and the . The Act is currently in .\n\n\n. On foreign affairs, he supported Israel and voted to restrict the threat of a nuclear Iran]]\nThe House Republican Steering Committee assigned Turner to three committees in the House, including '''''', '''''', and ''''''. When asked about the news, Turner said he was \"very excited to be appointed to three important House committees.\" Rep.  commended Turner's involvement in homeland security, saying Turner knew that \"New York is the number one target.\" Turner sided with the , and supported more funding for defense. Upon being chosen to serve on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he stated, \"I intend to forward my beliefs that it is in our national interest to defend our Middle East ally, Israel, and I will oppose further attempts by the U.N. to recognize a Palestinian state.\" He co-sponsored H.R. Bill 556, which condemned Iran for human rights abuses, and urged Pres. Obama to challenge Iran for its nuclear armament policies Turner pushed for strict economic sanctions on the , and criticized Sen.  for stalling H.R. 1905, which would have allowed the U.S. to restrict Iran's trade internationally and bar U.S.-Iran diplomacy.\n\n''Brooklyn Daily'' opined that the assignments would not allow Turner to make use of his business experience and offered little opportunity for him to deliver on his promises of bringing \"fiscal sanity\" to Washington. His predecessor, Anthony Weiner, had served in the '''''', which had the broadest jurisdiction of the committees.\n\n\nFollowing the 2010 Census, New York State lost two congressmen in its delegation, and Turner's district was split. ''Crain's New York Business'' said that Turner's win would make the New York Republican Party more likely to push for a \"super Jewish\" congressional district, extending the influence of Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community.  Under the new congressional district lines, he would possibly have faced  in a more African-American and heavily Democratic constituency; Turner was not optimistic about his chances, telling reporters, \"That’s a district that really can’t be moved. That’s not a legitimate shot.\"\n\n\n\nIn March 2012, he announced he would challenge Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator . Turner faced attorney  and Nassau County Comptroller  in a primary election to face Gillibrand.  The 2012 New York State Republican convention split the endorsement among the three candidates, with enough support for each candidate to automatically appear on the ballot.  Turner lost the primary election to Long on June 26, 2012. He additionally sought the endorsement of New York's , which he also lost to Long.\n\n\nOn March 12, 2015, Turner was named chairman of the  borough Republican Party. He was endorsed for the position by New York state Republican chairman , and voted in unanimously. On September 27, 2017, he was ousted as chairman by Joann Ariola.\n\n\nTurner is married to Peggy Turner, a foster care nurse for special needs children. The couple has five adult children and 13 grandchildren and resides in . In August 2011, Turner revealed the couple's 1994 adoption of C.J. Holmstrom, an orphan boy whose parents had died from AIDS. C.J.'s mother, Rosemary Holmstrom, had been on daytime talk shows in the 1980s discussing the death of her husband from AIDS and her own HIV-positive status. The Turners helped her and C.J. from that time on, adopting C.J. after her death.

Hein''' (born July 20, 1965) is an American politician who served as the 1st County Executive of , serving until February 10, 2019 after having first been elected on November 4, 2008. Prior to the creation of this position, the 2008 ratification by referendum of the Ulster County Charter, he was the Ulster County Administrator.\n\n\nHein was reared by his parents on their farm in  and attended school in .  In 1987, he received a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration with a special emphasis in Management from .\n\n\nHein became the deputy treasurer of Ulster County in 2003, and was appointed as county administrator in 2006.  The duties of that position have since been shifted to the purview of the county executive, a position which came into being in 2006 due to the passage of the first county charter.  Hein was elected to the position and assumed office in January 2009.\n\nHein cut spending by $6 million, through attrition and privatization, and provided a 0% tax increase for 2011  He has also promoted tourism initiatives in the county.\n\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the New York City Department of Environment Protection began releasing turbid water from the Ashokan Reservoir via a waste channel which feeds into Ulster County's . The Esopus Creek became contaminated with turbid water causing major problems to local farmers and residents as well as potentially damaging the aquatic ecosystem. This action by the agency which oversees the watershed feeding New York City's drinking water drew the attention of environmental groups and Ulster County residents, as well as that of County Executive Hein and many other local leaders.\n\nOn Tuesday January 12, 2010, after 97 days of contaminated releases into the Esopus Creek, County Executive Hein announced Ulster County's intentions to file a lawsuit against New York City DEP. After enlisting the help of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Attorney General's office, Hein brought an end to these releases and forced New York City DEP to pay for an independent damage assessment in order to evaluate the impact of their actions.\n\n\nIn October 2013, Hein included in his budget an amount totaling $642,000 that was to be earned by taking up tracks in an unused section of an almost 40-mile long corridor leased to a local tourist train company, the . Later, Hein suggested that much of the corridor be converted to a  while preserving segments for continued tourist train operations  In response, the railroad created a plan calling for both rail and trail throughout in the former . In 2013, Ulster County issued the tourism train a \"Notice to Cure\" citing lease violations. The lease with the tourism train was supposed to end in May 2016, and Mr. Hein was working with the Ulster County Legislature and other entities to prepare for future uses of the corridor.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, it was announced that the Catskill Mountain Railroad would be allowed to continue its operations between Kingston and Hurley, as well as Phoenicia and Boiceville.  In late 2016, Mr. Hein denied the railroad the right to operate out of Phoenicia, and the County made that portion of the line available to the highest bidder shortly thereafter.  The railroad bid for another lease on the line but Rail Explorers Inc. came in higher and was allowed to restore and operate the line with their rail-based bicycle system.\n\nRail Explorers had put very little effort into restoring the line early on and missed their 2017 opening date, reportedly they will begin operating the line after Memorial Day 2018.  Many local communities are in disagreement the actions of the County and of the Rail Explorers.  One point of argument is the proposed parking lot and bus turn around in the small residential village of Cold Brook.  Many residents fear that riders may wonder throughout the neighborhood, trespass and damage private property, while waiting for a bus to arrive and pick them up to return them to Phoenicia, the Rail Explorer's base of operations.\n\nThe Catskill Mountain Railroad has a large amount of its equipment stored in Phoenicia, however much of it is stored on County-owned rail, the County has reportedly sued them for not removing their equipment from the property, the railroad has no way of moving the equipment off of County Property as Phoenicia is cut off from the rest of the United States' rail network, including the rest of the Catskill Mountain Railroad.  Currently, the Empire State Railway Museum is attempting to construct several storage tracks on their property for the railroad to store their equipment.  In January 2018, Ulster County oversaw the removal of a large portion of the line along the Ashokan Reservoir.  According to local sources, they removed the rail, but have not completely removed the contaminated ties, which raises an environmental issue due to the adjacent Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies drinking water to New York City, and Esopus Creek, both of which provide habitat for much wildlife, including a large population of bald eagles.\n\n\n\n\n\n* ''Official County Government Site''\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Selvaratnam added that Schneiderman spat on her, choked her, called her his \"brown slave,\" ordered her to call him \"Master\" and say that she was \"his property,\" and demanded that she find another woman who would be willing to engage in a ''ménage à trois''. Both Selvaratnam and Barish alleged that Schneiderman engaged in a pattern of alcohol abuse, and that he had threatened to kill them if they ended their respective relationships with him. Mayer and Farrow reported that they confirmed the women's allegations with photographs of wounds and bruises, as well as with statements from friends in whom the women had confided after the assaults.\n\nIn his initial response to the allegations, Schneiderman said: \"In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.\" Three hours after the article was published in '''', Schneiderman announced his resignation effective the next day. In a statement, he said that he \"strongly contested\" the allegations, but resigned because they would \"effectively prevent\" him from performing the duties of his office. He did not seek re-election. Schneiderman's deputy, Solicitor General , was appointed to replace him as Attorney General.\n\nGovernor  assigned  District Attorney  as a special prosecutor to investigate possible criminal charges against Schneiderman. On November 8, 2018, Singas announced that Schneiderman would not be prosecuted. Singas stated that she believed the allegations made by Schneiderman's accusers, but added that \"legal impediments, including statutes of limitations, preclude criminal prosecution.\" In response, Schneiderman stated, \"I recognize that District Attorney Singas' decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong. I accept full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them.\" Schneiderman further stated that he was \"committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends\" and apologized for the pain he had caused.\n\nIn 2019, Schneiderman had completed a class on becoming a meditation teacher. As a supporter of the #MeToo movement prior to the allegations against him, Schneiderman has worked to address and rectify his personal behavior. In 2022, he promised not to run for political office again.\n\n\n\n*McGowan was also listed on the Liberal Party line; Brance was also listed on the Right to Life Party line.\n\n*Schneiderman was also listed on the Working Families Party line; Madon was also listed on the Independence Party line.\n\n*Schneiderman was also listed on the Working Families Party line.\n\n*Schneiderman was also listed on the Working Families Party line.\n\n*Schneiderman was also listed on the Working Families Party line.\n\n*Schneiderman was also listed on the Working Families Party line.\n\n\n*Schneiderman was also listed on the Independence Party and Working Families Party line; Donovan was also listed on the Conservative Party line.\n\n*Schneiderman was also listed on the Independence Party, Working Families Party, and Women's Equality Party lines; Cahill was also listed on the Conservative Party and Stop Common Core Party lines.\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* ''\".''\" New York, New York, 2020\n\n\n* \n*   Official campaign website\n*  listing from New York State Unified Court System\n* Disciplinary case https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/attorneyservices/wicket/page?4-1.-historyPanel-wmcDisciplinaryHistory-disciplinaryHistory-0-CourtDecisionsSearchPage\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He is the only child of working-class parents Helen (née D'Avanzo) and Harold Angelo Giuliani, both children of Italian immigrants.  Harold Giuliani, a plumber and a bartender, had trouble holding a job, was convicted of  assault and robbery, and served prison time in . Once released, his father worked as an  for his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, who operated an -affiliated ing and gambling ring from a restaurant in Brooklyn.\n\nGiuliani was raised a . When he was seven years old, his family moved from Brooklyn to  on , where he attended the local Catholic school, St. Anne's. Later, he commuted back to Brooklyn to attend , where he graduated in 1961.\n\nGiuliani attended  in , where he majored in  with a minor in philosophy.\nGiuliani was elected president of his class in his sophomore year, but was not re-elected in his junior year. He joined the  college forensic fraternity and honor society. He graduated in 1965.\n\nGiuliani considered becoming a priest but decided to attend  in , where he was a member of the '''' and graduated '''' with a  degree in 1968.\n\n\nGiuliani started his career and political life as a , working as a Democratic Party committeeman on  in the mid-1960s. In 1968, he volunteered for 's presidential campaign in the , and voted for  for president in the .\n\n in 1984]]\nAfter graduating from law school, Giuliani  for Judge , United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.\n\nGiuliani did not serve in the military during the . His  was deferred while he was enrolled at Manhattan College and NYU Law. Upon graduation from law school in 1968, he was  1-A (available for military service), but in 1969 he was reclassified 2-A (essential civilian) as Judge MacMahon's law clerk. In 1970, Giuliani was reclassified 1-A but received a high 308 draft lottery number and was not called up for service.\n\n\nGiuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent in 1975. This occurred during a period of time in which he was recruited for a position in , with the : Giuliani served as the  and  to  .\n\nHis first high-profile prosecution was of Democratic   (), who was convicted of corruption. Podell pleaded guilty to conspiracy and conflict of interest for accepting more than $41,000 in campaign contributions and legal fees from a Florida airline to obtain federal rights for a Bahama route. Podell, who maintained a legal practice while serving in Congress, said the payments were legitimate legal fees. '''' later reported, \"The trial catapulted future New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani to front-page status when, as assistant U.S. attorney, he relentlessly cross-examined an initially calm Rep. Podell. The congressman reportedly grew more flustered and eventually decided to plead guilty.\"\n\nFrom 1977 to 1981, during the , Giuliani practiced law at the  , as chief of staff to his former boss, Ace Tyler. In later years, Tyler became \"disillusioned\" by what Tyler described as Giuliani's time as US Attorney, criticizing several of his prosecutions as \"overkill\".\n\nOn December 8, 1980, one month after  brought Republicans back to power in Washington, he switched his party affiliation from Independent to Republican. Giuliani later said the switches were because he found Democratic policies \"naïve\", and that \"by the time I moved to Washington, the Republicans had come to make more sense to me.\" Others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the Justice Department. Giuliani's mother maintained in 1988 that he \"only became a Republican after he began to get all these jobs from them. He's definitely not a conservative Republican. He thinks he is, but he isn't. He still feels very sorry for the poor.\"\n\n\nIn 1981, Giuliani was named  in the , the third-highest position in the . As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S. Attorney Offices' federal law enforcement agencies, the , the , and the . In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the  \"detention posture\" regarding the internment of more than 2,000 an s who had entered the country illegally. The U.S. government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were \"economic migrants\". In defense of the government's position, Giuliani testified that \"political repression, at least in general, does not exist\" under  's regime.\n\n\nIn 1983, Giuliani was appointed to be , which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases and because the  is considered the highest-profile United States Attorney's Office in the country and as such is often used by those who have held the position as a springboard for running for public office. It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of  figures  and . He also focused on prosecuting drug dealers, , and corruption in government. He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals. As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the , parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool. After Giuliani \"patented the perp walk\", the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide.\n\nGiuliani's critics said that he arranged for people to be arrested but then dropped charges for lack of evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his arrests of alleged  at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened sparked controversy and damaged the reputations of the alleged \"perps\". He said veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of , was guilty of ; in February 1987 he had , with Wigton in tears. Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young arbitrageur and former colleague of Wigton, so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond.\n\nWithin three months, charges were dropped against both Wigton and Tabor; Giuliani said, \"We're not going to go to trial. We're just the tip of the iceberg\", but no further charges were forthcoming and the investigation did not end until Giuliani's successor was in place. Giuliani's high-profile raid of the Princeton/Newport firm ended with the defendants having their cases overturned on appeal on the grounds that what they had been convicted of were not crimes.\n\n\n\n]]\nIn the , which ran from February 25, 1985, through November 19, 1986, Giuliani indicted eleven  figures, including the heads of New York City's so-called \"\", under the  (RICO) on charges including , labor racketeering, and . '''' magazine called this \"case of cases\" possibly \"the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the  was swept away in 1943\", and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: \"Our approach is to wipe out the five families.\"  boss  evaded conviction when he and his   were murdered on the streets of  on December&nbsp;16, 1985. However, three heads of the Five Families were sentenced to 100 years in prison on January 13, 1987.  and  leaders,  and , received additional sentences in separate trials, with 70-year and 39-year sentences to run consecutively. He was assisted by three Assistant United States Attorneys: , the eventual second United States Secretary of Homeland Security and co-author of the ; John Savarese, now a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz; and Gil Childers, a later deputy chief of the criminal division for the Southern District of New York and now managing director in the legal department at Goldman Sachs.\n\nAccording to an FBI memo revealed in 2007, leaders of the Five Families voted in late 1986 on whether to issue a contract for Giuliani's death. Heads of the , , and Genovese families rejected the idea, though Colombo and Gambino leaders, Carmine Persico and , encouraged assassination. In 2014, it was revealed by former  member and informant  that , a notorious Sicilian Mafia leader, had ordered a murder contract on Giuliani during the mid-1980s. Riina allegedly was suspicious of Giuliani's efforts prosecuting the American Mafia and was worried that he might have spoken with Italian anti-Mafia prosecutors and politicians, including  and , who were both murdered in 1992 in separate car bombings. According to Giuliani, the Sicilian Mafia offered $800,000 for his death during his first year as mayor of New York in 1994.\n\n\n, a Wall Street ur who had amassed a fortune of about $200million by betting on corporate takeovers, was originally investigated by the  (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders, leading the way for the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York to investigate as well. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader . Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a -year prison sentence along with a $100million fine. In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Giuliani had his license to practice law suspended in the state of New York, pending an investigation related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. On July 2, 2024, he was disbarred in the state of New York. On September 26, 2024, he was disbarred in the District of Columbia under reciprocal discipline.\n\n\nGiuliani was U.S. Attorney until January 1989, resigning as the  ended. He garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions. He joined the law firm  in New York City as a partner. He remained with White & Case until May 1990, when he joined the law firm Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, also in New York City.\n\n\n in 1989]]\n\nGiuliani first ran for New York City mayor in 1989, when he attempted to unseat three-term incumbent . He won the September 1989 Republican Party  against business magnate  in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was  after an acrimonious debate between the two men. In the Democratic primary, Koch was upset by Manhattan  .\n\nIn the general election, Giuliani ran as the  candidate of both the Republican and the  parties. The , which had often co-lined the Republican party candidate, withheld support from Giuliani and ran Lauder instead. Conservative Party leaders were unhappy with Giuliani on ideological grounds. They cited the Liberal Party's endorsement statement that Giuliani \"agreed with the Liberal Party's views on , , , , and tuition s\".\n\nDuring two televised debates, Giuliani framed himself as an agent of change, saying, \"I'm the reformer,\" that \"If we keep going merrily along, this city's going down,\" and that electing Dinkins would represent \"more of the same, more of the rotten politics that have been dragging us down\". Giuliani pointed out that Dinkins had not filed a tax return for many years and several other ethical missteps, in particular a stock transfer to his son. Dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off. He denied other wrongdoing, saying that \"what we need is a mayor, not a prosecutor\" and that Giuliani refused to say \"the R-wordhe doesn't like to admit he's a Republican\". Dinkins won the endorsements of three of the four daily New York newspapers, while Giuliani won approval from the ''''.\n\nIn the end, Giuliani lost to Dinkins by a margin of 47,080 votes out of 1,899,845 votes cast, in the closest election in New York City's history. The closeness of the race was particularly noteworthy, considering the small percentage of New York City residents who are registered Republicans, and it resulted in Giuliani being the presumptive nominee for a rematch with Dinkins at the next election.\n\n\n\nFour years after his defeat to Dinkins, Giuliani again ran for mayor. Once again, Giuliani also ran on the Liberal Party line but not the Conservative Party line, which ran activist George Marlin.\n\nAlthough crime had begun to fall during the Dinkins administration, Giuliani's campaign capitalized on the perception that crime was uncontrolled in the city following events such as the  and the . The year prior to the election, Giuliani was a key speaker at a  opposing Dinkins, in which Giuliani blamed the police department's low morale on Dinkins' leadership. The rally quickly devolved into a riot, with nearly 4,000 off-duty police officers storming the  and blocking traffic on the .\n\nDinkins and Giuliani never debated during the campaign, because they were never able to agree on how to approach a debate. Dinkins was endorsed by ''The New York Times'' and '''', while Giuliani was endorsed by the '''' and, in a key switch from 1989, the New York ''''. Giuliani went to visit the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi , seeking his blessing and endorsement.\n\nOn election day, Giuliani's campaign hired off-duty cops, firefighters, and corrections officers to  in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and The Bronx for cases of . Despite objections from the Dinkins campaign, who said that the effort would intimidate Democratic voters, Police Commissioner  assigned an additional 52 police captains and 3,500 officers to monitor the city's polling places.\n\nGiuliani won by a margin of 53,367 votes. He became the first Republican elected mayor of New York City since  in 1965. Similar to the election four years prior, Giuliani performed particularly well in the white ethnic neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Giuliani saw especially high returns in the borough of Staten Island, as a referendum to consider allowing the borough to secede from New York City was on the ballot.\n\n\n\n\nGiuliani's opponent in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough president , who had beaten  in the September 9, 1997, Democratic primary. In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party and not the Conservative Party listing. Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997  poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.\n\nThroughout the campaign he was well ahead in the polls and had a strong fund-raising advantage over Messinger. On her part, Messinger lost the support of several usually Democratic constituencies, including gay organizations and large labor unions. The local daily newspapers''The New York Times'', '''', '''' and ''''all endorsed Giuliani over Messinger.\n\nIn the end, Giuliani won 58% of the vote to Messinger's 41%, becoming the first registered Republican to win a second term as mayor while on the Republican line since  in 1941. Voter turnout was the lowest in twelve years, with 38% of registered voters casting ballots. The margin of victory included gains in his share of the  vote (20% compared to 1993's 5%) and the  vote (43% from 37%) while maintaining his base of white ethnic and Catholic and Jewish voters from 1993.\n\n\n\n in 1993]]\n\nGiuliani served as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001.\n\n\nIn Giuliani's first term as mayor, the at the instigation of Commissioner adopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on 's \"\" approach. This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping,  possession, and  by \"\", on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained. The legal underpinning for removing the \"squeegee men\" from the streets was developed under Giuliani's predecessor, Mayor David Dinkins. Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner , also created and instituted , a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions. Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data. An extensive study found a high correlation between crime rates reported by the police through CompStat and rates of crime available from other sources, suggesting there had been no manipulation. The CompStat initiative won the 1996 Innovations in Government Award from .\n\n\nDuring Giuliani's administration, crime rates dropped in New York City. The extent to which Giuliani deserves the credit is disputed. Crime rates in New York City had started to drop in 1991 under previous mayor , three years before Giuliani took office. A small nationwide drop in crime preceded Giuliani's election, and some critics say he may have been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress. Additional contributing factors to the overall decline in New York City crime during the 1990s were the addition of 7,000 officers to the NYPD, lobbied for and hired by the Dinkins administration, and an overall improvement in the national economy. Changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions, which were similar across the country during this time. Because the crime index is based on that of the , which is self-reported by police departments, some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories the FBI does not collect. Sociologist , in his 2006 book ''The Great American Crime Decline'', claimed that \"up to half of New York's crime drop in the 1990s, and virtually 100 percent of its continuing  since 2000, has resulted from policing.\"\n\nBratton was featured on the cover of '''' magazine in 1996. Giuliani reportedly forced Bratton out after two years, in what was seen as a battle of two large egos in which Giuliani was not tolerant of Bratton's celebrity. Bratton went on to become chief of the . Giuliani's term also saw allegations of civil rights abuses and other police misconduct under other commissioners after Bratton's departure. There were police shootings of unarmed suspects, and the scandals surrounding the torture of  and the killings of ,  and . Giuliani supported the New York City Police Department, by releasing, for example, what he called Dorismond's \"extensive criminal record\" to the public, including a sealed juvenile file.\n\n\nThe Giuliani administration advocated the privatization of the city's public schools, which he called \"dysfunctional\", and the reduction of state funding for them. He advocated a -based system to promote private schooling. Giuliani supported protection for . He continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the  about immigration violations, on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of .\n\nDuring his mayoralty, gay and  New Yorkers received ship rights. Giuliani induced the city's Democratic-controlled New York City Council, which had avoided the issue for years, to pass legislation providing broad protection for s. In 1998, he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith , Giuliani was ineligible to run in 2001 for a third term as mayor. In November 1998, four-term incumbent Democratic   announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat. Because of his high profile and visibility, Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party. Giuliani's entrance led Democratic Congressman  and others to recruit then-  to run for Moynihan's seat, hoping she might combat his star power.\n\nIn April 1999, Giuliani formed an exploratory committee in connection with the Senate run. By January 2000, polling for the race showed Giuliani nine points ahead of Clinton, in part because his campaign was able to take advantage of several campaign stumbles by Clinton. In March 2000, however, the 's fatal shooting of  inflamed Giuliani's strained relations with the city's minority communities, and Clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue. By April 2000, reports showed Clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking Giuliani, who said his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more. Clinton was now eight to ten points ahead of Giuliani in the polls.\n\nThen followed  in which Giuliani learned he had  and needed treatment; his extramarital relationship with  became public and the subject of a media frenzy; and he announced a separation from his wife . After much indecision, on May 19, Giuliani announced his withdrawal from the Senate race.\n\n\n\n and Giuliani at the site of the World Trade Center on November 14, 2001]]\n\n\nGiuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the . He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September11 and afterwardsfor example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of  or ry into the air was a factor in the attack. In his public statements, Giuliani said:\n... I want the people of New York to be an example to the rest of the country, and the rest of the world, that terrorism can't stop us.}}\n\nThe 9/11 attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the Democratic and Republican candidates to succeed Giuliani. The primary was immediately delayed two weeks to September 25. During this period, Giuliani sought an unprecedented three-month emergency extension of his term from January1 to April1 under the  (Article3, Section 25). In October 2000, he had considered supporting city council efforts to remove their own term limits, though was not in favor of ending consecutive mayoral term limits. In the end, leaders in the  and  indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary. The election proceeded as scheduled, and the winning candidate, the Giuliani-endorsed Republican convert , took office on January 1, 2002, per normal custom.\n\nGiuliani said he had been at the  site \"as often, if not more, than most workers... I was there working with them. I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I'm one of them.\" Some 9/11 workers have objected to those claims. While his appointment logs were unavailable for the six days immediately following the attacks, Giuliani logged 29 hours at the site over three months beginning September 17. This contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days.\n\n\nWhen Saudi Prince  suggested the attacks were an indication that the United States \"should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the  cause,\" Giuliani asserted, \"There is no moral equivalent for this act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem.\" Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince's $10million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack.\n\n\n\n\nGiuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the  headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the  building. Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous . The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters. Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7World Trade to power the command center. In May 1997, Giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on , who had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as New York City's first director of emergency management. Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided  and '''' with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in  but was overruled by Giuliani. Television journalist  interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center. Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and that Hauer said the WTC site was the best location. Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter. The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan. The February 1996 memo read, \"The [Brooklyn] building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan.\"\n to a new cabinet-level position to oversee homeland defense initiatives]]\n\nIn January 2008, an eight-page memo was revealed which detailed the New York City Police Department's opposition in 1998 to the location of the city's emergency command center at the Trade Center site. The Giuliani administration overrode these concerns.\n\nThe '''' noted that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks. The commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Family members of 9/11 victims have said these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years. The radios were not working when Fire Department chiefs ordered the 343 firefighters inside the towers to evacuate, and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed. However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission he said the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives. Giuliani testified to the commission, where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements. A 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty. Replacement radios were purchased in a $33million  with , and implemented in early 2001. However, the radios were recalled in March 2001 after a probationary firefighter's calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene, leaving firemen with the old  radios from 1993. A book later published by Commission members  and , ''Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission'', argued that the commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with Giuliani.\n\nAn October 2001 study by the National Institute of Environmental Safety and Health said cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear.\n\n\nGiuliani gained international attention after the attacks and was widely hailed for his leadership role. Polls taken just six weeks after the attack showed a 79 percent approval rating among New York City voters. This was a dramatic increase over the 36 percent rating he had received a year earlier, which was an average at the end of a two-term mayorship.  called him \"America's Mayor\" at a 9/11 memorial service held at  on September 23, 2001.\n\nGiuliani was praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts, but others argue that \"Giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks, casting himself as a hero for political gain.\" Giuliani has collected $11.4million from speaking fees in a single year (with increased demand after the attacks). Before September11, Giuliani's assets were estimated to be somewhat less than $2million, but his net worth could now be as high as 30 times that amount. He has made most of his money since leaving office.\n\n\nOn December 24, 2001, '''' magazine named Giuliani its  for 2001. ''Time'' observed that, before 9/11, Giuliani's public image had been that of a rigid, self-righteous, ambitious politician. After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image became that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis. Historian Vincent J. Cannato concluded in September 2006:\nsafer, more prosperous, more confidentthan the one he had inherited eight years earlier, even with the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center at its heart. Debates about his accomplishments will continue, but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny.}}\n\n\n and Giuliani at the New York Foreign Press Center Briefing on \"New York City After September 11, 2001\"]]\n\nFor his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary  () by  on February 13, 2002.\n\nGiuliani initially downplayed the  in the  and lower Manhattan areas in the vicinity of the . He moved quickly to reopen , and it was reopened on September 17. In the first month after the attacks, he said \"The air quality is safe and acceptable.\"\n at the U.S. Delegation to OSCE's Anti-Semitism Meeting in Vienna, Austria, in 2003]]\n\nGiuliani took control away from agencies such as the , the  and the , leaving the \"largely unknown\" city Department of Design and Construction in charge of recovery and cleanup. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of . Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed. In June 2007, , former Republican governor of  and director of the  (EPA), reportedly said the EPA had pushed for workers at the WTC site to wear respirators but she had been blocked by Giuliani. She said she believed the subsequent  and deaths suffered by WTC responders were a result of these actions. However, former deputy mayor , then with the Giuliani campaign, replied, \"All workers at Ground Zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators.\"\n\nGiuliani asked the city's Congressional delegation to limit the city's  for Ground Zero illnesses to a total of $350million. Two years after Giuliani finished his term, FEMA appropriated $1billion to a special insurance fund, called the , to protect the city against 9/11 lawsuits.\n\nIn February 2007, the  issued a letter asserting that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: \"Mayor Giuliani's actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no  for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the ,\" it said, adding: \"Hundreds remained entombed in Ground Zero when Giuliani gave up on them.\" Lawyers for the International Association of Fire Fighters seek to interview Giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that New York City negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the Fresh Kills Landfill.\n\n\n\n\n in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on August 26, 2004]]\n\nSince leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels. When  became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since  and . Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the  to New York City. He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President  for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell,\n}}\n\nSimilarly, in June 2006, Giuliani started a website called Solutions America to help elect Republican candidates across the nation.\n\nAfter campaigning on Bush's behalf in the , he was reportedly the top choice for  after 's resignation. When suggestions were made that Giuliani's confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals, he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former New York Police Commissioner . After the formal announcement of Kerik's nomination, information about Kerik's pastmost notably, that he had ties to organized crime, had failed to properly report gifts he had received, had been sued for  and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servantbecame known, and Kerik withdrew his nomination.\n mobile museum in , in September 2003]]\n\nOn March 15, 2006, Congress formed the  (ISG). This  ten-person panel, of which Giuliani was one of the members, was charged with assessing the  and making recommendations. They would eventually unanimously conclude that contrary to  assertions, \"The situation in  is grave and deteriorating\" and called for \"changes in the primary mission\" that would allow \"the United States to begin to move its forces out of Iraq\".\n\nOn May 24, 2006, after missing all the group's meetings, including a briefing from General , former   and former  , Giuliani resigned from the panel, citing \"previous time commitments\". Giuliani's fundraising schedule had kept him from participating in the panel, a schedule which raised $11.4million in s over fourteen months, and that Giuliani had been forced to resign after being given \"an ultimatum to either show up for meetings or leave the group\" by group leader . Giuliani subsequently said he had started thinking about running for president, and being on the panel might give it a political spin.\n\nGiuliani was described by ''Newsweek'' in January 2007 as \"one of the most consistent cheerleaders for the president's handling of the war in Iraq\" and as of June 2007, he remained one of the few candidates for president to unequivocally support both the basis for  and the execution of the war.\n\nGiuliani spoke in support of the removal of the  (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the . The group was on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. Giuliani, along with other former government officials and politicians , , , , , , , and , were criticized for their involvement with the group. Giuliani and others reportedly received tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to advocate for the MEK; some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees. Several commentators wrote that under the , these people could be potentially prosecuted for , a claim Giuliani denied. Giuliani and others wrote an article for the conservative publication '''' stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization. They supported their position by pointing out that the United Kingdom and the European Union had already removed the group from their terrorism lists. They further assert that only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group. However, Canada did not delist the group until December 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2006, Giuliani announced the formation of an  toward a run for . In February 2007, he filed a \"statement of candidacy\" and confirmed on the television program '''' that he was indeed running.\n in August 2007 when polls showed him as the front-runner for the Republican party's nomination]]\n\nEarly polls showed Giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition ever recorded along with high levels of support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007, he was the leader in . Senator , who ranked a close second behind the New York Mayor, had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared Republican candidates, with only former senator  and former governor  showing greater support in some . On November 7, 2007, Giuliani's campaign received an endorsement from ,  founder, and past presidential candidate . This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that  and other s could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.\n\nGiuliani's campaign hit a difficult stretch during the last two months of 2007, when , whom Giuliani had recommended for the position of Secretary of Homeland Security, was indicted on 16 counts of tax fraud and other federal charges. The media reported that when Giuliani was the mayor of New York, he billed several tens of thousands of dollars of mayoral security expenses to obscure city agencies. Those expenses were incurred while he visited , with whom he was having an extramarital affair (later analysis showed the billing to likely be unrelated to hiding Nathan). Several stories were published in the press regarding clients of  and  who were in opposition to goals of American foreign policy. Giuliani's national poll numbers began steadily slipping and his unusual strategy of focusing more on later, multi-primary big states rather than the smaller, first-voting states was seen at risk.\n, the day before the ]]\n\nDespite his strategy, Giuliani competed to a substantial extent in the January 8, 2008,  but finished a distant fourth with 9percent of the vote. Similar poor results continued in other early contests, when Giuliani's staff went without pay in order to focus all efforts on the crucial late January . The shift of the electorate's focus from  to the state of the economy also hurt Giuliani, as did the resurgence of McCain's similarly themed campaign. On January 29, 2008, Giuliani finished a distant third in the Florida result with 15percent of the vote, trailing McCain and Romney. Facing declining polls and lost leads in the upcoming large  states, including that of his home New York, Giuliani withdrew from the race on January 30, endorsing McCain.\n\nGiuliani's campaign ended up $3.6million in arrears, and in June 2008 Giuliani sought to retire the debt by proposing to appear at Republican fundraisers during the 2008 general election, and have part of the proceeds go towards his campaign. During the , Giuliani gave a prime-time speech that praised McCain and his running mate, , while criticizing Democratic nominee . He cited Palin's executive experience as a mayor and governor and belittled Obama's lack of same, and his remarks were met with wild applause from the delegates. Giuliani continued to be one of McCain's most active surrogates during the remainder of McCain's eventually unsuccessful campaign.\n\n\nFollowing the end of his presidential campaign, Giuliani's \"high appearance fees dropped like a stone\". He returned to work at both  and . His consultancy work included advising  with her presidential campaign during the . Giuliani also explored hosting a syndicated radio show, and was reported to be in talks with  about replacing  before that position went to  (another unsuccessful 2008 GOP presidential primary candidate). In 2009, Giuliani said the  and   lacked executive competence in dealing with the .\n\n\nGiuliani said his political career was not necessarily over, and did not rule out a  or  bid. A November 2008  poll indicated that although Governor promoted to the office via the  a year beforewas popular among New Yorkers, he would have just a slight lead over Giuliani in a hypothetical matchup. By February 2009, after the prolonged , a Siena College poll indicated that Paterson was losing popularity among New Yorkers, and showed Giuliani with a fifteen-point lead in the hypothetical contest. In January 2009, Giuliani said he would not decide on a gubernatorial run for another six to eight months, adding that he thought it would not be fair to the governor to start campaigning early while the governor tries to focus on his job. Giuliani worked to retire his presidential campaign debt, but by the end of March 2009 it was still $2.4million in arrears, the largest such remaining amount for any of the 2008 contenders. In April 2009, Giuliani strongly opposed Paterson's announced push for  and said it would likely cause a backlash that could put Republicans in statewide office in 2010. By late August 2009, there were still conflicting reports about whether Giuliani was likely to run.\n\nOn December 23, 2009, Giuliani announced that he would not seek any office in 2010, saying \"The main reason has to do with my two enterprises: Bracewell & Giuliani and Giuliani Partners. I'm very busy in both.\" The decisions signaled a possible end to Giuliani's political career. During the , Giuliani endorsed and campaigned for  and .\n\nOn October 11, 2011, Giuliani announced that he was not running for president. According to Kevin Law, the director of the , Giuliani believed that \"As a moderate, he thought it was a pretty significant challenge. He said it's tough to be a moderate and succeed in GOP primaries,\" Giuliani said \"If it's too late for (New Jersey Governor) , it's too late for me.\"\n\nAt a  fund-raising event in February 2015, Giuliani said, \"I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president Obama loves America,\" and \"He doesn't love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country.\" In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, \"Some people thought it was racistI thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.\" White House deputy press secretary  said he agreed with Giuliani \"that it was a horrible thing to say\", but he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess whether the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiuliani supported  in the . He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the . Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate  appeared at an event for the pro-Trump . Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled \"Leadership\". Giuliani's and ' appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies.\n\nDuring the campaign, Giuliani praised Trump for his worldwide accomplishments and helping fellow New Yorkers in their time of need. He defended Trump against allegations of , , and not paying any federal income taxes for as long as two decades.\n\nIn August 2016, Giuliani, while campaigning for Trump, said that in the \"eight years before Obama\" became president, \"we didn't have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States\". It was noted that 9/11 happened during George W. Bush's first term.  brought up four more counter-examples (the , the 2002 , the  and the ) to Giuliani's claim. Giuliani later said he was using \"abbreviated language\".\n\nGiuliani was believed to be a likely pick for secretary of state in the . However, on December 9, 2016, Trump announced that Giuliani had removed his name from consideration for any Cabinet post.\n\n\nThe  named Giuliani his informal cybersecurity adviser on January 12, 2017. The status of this informal role for Giuliani is unclear because, in November 2018, Trump created the  (CISA), headed by  as director and  as deputy. In the weeks following his appointment, Giuliani was forced to consult an   when he \"was locked out of his  because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times\", belying his putative expertise in the field.\n\nIn January 2017, Giuliani said he advised  in matters relating to , which barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days.\n, ,  and other American politicians at the  (PMOI) event in 2018]]\n  recognizes Giuliani prior to signing H.R. 1327; an act to permanently authorize the September11 Victim Compensation Fund, on July 29, 2019]]\nGiuliani has drawn scrutiny over his ties to foreign nations, regarding not registering per the  (FARA).\n\n\n\nIn mid April 2018, Giuliani joined Trump's legal team, which dealt with the  by  into . Giuliani said his goal was to negotiate a swift end to the investigation.\n\nIn early May, Giuliani made public that Trump had reimbursed his personal attorney  $130,000 that Cohen had paid to adult-film actress  for her agreement not to talk about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen had earlier insisted he used his own money to pay Daniels, and he implied that he had not been reimbursed. Trump had previously said he knew nothing about the matter. Within a week, Giuliani said some of his own statements regarding this matter were \"more rumor than anything else\".\n\nLater in May 2018, Giuliani, who was asked on whether the promotion of the  conspiracy theory is meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, said the investigators \"are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president... it is for public opinion\" on whether to \"impeach or not impeach\" Trump. In June 2018, Giuliani said that a sitting president cannot be indicted: \"I don't know how you can indict while he's in office. No matter what it is. If President Trump shot [then-FBI director] , he'd be impeached the next day. Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him.\"\n\nIn June 2018, Giuliani also said Trump should not testify to the special counsel investigation because \"our recollection keeps changing\". In early July, Giuliani characterized that Trump had previously asked Comey to \"give him [then-national security adviser Michael Flynn] a break\". In mid-August, Giuliani denied making this comment: \"What I said was, that is what Comey is saying Trump said.\" On August 19 on '''', Giuliani argued that Trump should not testify to the special counsel investigation because Trump could be \"trapped into \" just by telling \"somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth.\" Giuliani's argument continued: \"Truth isn't truth.\" Giuliani later clarified that he was \"referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements\".\n\nIn late July, Giuliani defended Trump by saying \"collusion is not a crime\" and that Trump had done nothing wrong because he \"didn't hack\" or \"pay for the hacking\". He later elaborated that his comments were a \"very, very familiar lawyer's argument\" to \"attack the legitimacy of the special counsel investigation\". He also described and denied several supposed allegations that have never been publicly raised, regarding two earlier meetings among Trump campaign officials to set up the June 9, 2016,  with Russian citizens. In late August, Giuliani said the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower \"meeting was originally for the purpose of getting information about Hillary Clinton\".\n\nAdditionally in late July, Giuliani attacked Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as an \"incredible liar\", two months after calling Cohen an \"honest, honorable lawyer\". In mid-August, Giuliani defended Trump by saying: \"The president's an honest man.\"\n\nIt was reported in early September that Giuliani said the White House could and likely would prevent the special counsel investigation from making public certain information in its final report which would be covered by executive privilege. Also according to Giuliani, Trump's personal legal team is already preparing a \"counter-report\" to refute the potential special counsel investigation's report.\n\nGiuliani privately urged Trump in 2017 to extradite .\n\nIn late 2019, Giuliani represented Venezuelan businessman , meeting with the  to ask not to bring charges against him.\n\nIn an interview with  in '''' magazine, Giuliani, who is a Roman Catholic of Italian descent, said: \"Don't tell me I'm anti-Semitic if I oppose George Soros... I'm more of a Jew than Soros is.\"  is a Hungarian-born  who survived . The  replied, \"Mr. Giuliani should apologize and retract his comments immediately unless he seeks to  to hardcore anti-Semites and white supremacists who believe this garbage.\"\n\nIn the last days of the Trump administration, when White House aides were soliciting fees to lobby for presidential pardons, Giuliani said that while he'd heard that large fees were being offered, he did not work on clemency cases, saying \"I have enough money. I'm not starving.\"\n\nAs of February 16, 2021, Giuliani was reportedly not actively involved in any of Trump's pending legal cases.\n\nBy 2023, Giuliani had reportedly incurred seven-figure legal fees in cases related to Donald Trump and the . In April 2023, Giuliani and his lawyer Robert Costello met twice with Trump at  to ask him for money. In response, a Trump PAC paid $340,000 toward Giuliani's data storage bill.\n\nOn February 7, 2024, Giuliani appeared in court for a discussion in his bankruptcy case. He told a U.S. Trustee attorney that he is owed about $2 million by the Trump campaign and the , which \"just paid the expenses. Not all, but most. They never paid the legal fees.\" He said he did not wish to hold Donald Trump personally responsible for this bill.  On July 12, 2024, his bankruptcy case was dismissed, and he was not allowed to file for bankruptcy again for one year.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince at least May 2019, Giuliani has been urging Ukraine's newly elected president, , to investigate the oil company , whose board of directors once included 's son , and to check for irregularities in Ukraine's investigation of . He said such investigations would benefit his client's defense, and that his efforts had Trump's full support. Toward this end, Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials throughout 2019. In July 2019, '''' reported that two Soviet-born Americans,  and , were liaisons between Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials in this effort.  and Fruman, prolific Republican donors, have neither registered as foreign agents in the United States, nor been evaluated and approved by the State Department. Giuliani responded, \"This (report) is a pathetic effort to cover up what are enormous allegations of criminality by the Biden family.\" Yet by September 2019, there had been no clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nAs of October 1, 2019, Giuliani hired former  prosecutor Jon Sale to represent him in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment investigation. The committee also issued a subpoena to Giuliani asking him to release documents related to the Ukraine scandal. ''The New York Times'' reported on October 11, 2019, that the , which Giuliani had once led, was investigating him for violating lobbying laws related to his activities in Ukraine. The following month, ''Bloomberg News'' reported that the investigation could extend to bribery of foreign officials or conspiracy, and ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported Giuliani was being investigated for a possible profit motive in a Ukrainian natural gas venture. Giuliani has denied having any interest in a Ukrainian natural gas venture. In late November, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that federal prosecutors had just issued subpoenas to multiple associates of Giuliani to potentially investigate certain individuals, apparently including Giuliani, on numerous potential charges, including money laundering, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, and mail/wire fraud.\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested for campaign finance violations while attempting to board a one-way flight to Frankfurt from  on October 9, 2019. Giuliani was paid $500,000 to consult for Lev Parnas's company named \"Fraud Guarantee\". Republican donor and Trump supporter Long Island attorney Charles Gucciardo paid Giuliani on behalf of Fraud Guarantee in two $250,000 payments, in September and October 2018. Fruman eventually pled guilty in September 2021 to having solicited a contribution by a foreign national.\n\nIn May 2019, Giuliani described Ukraine's chief prosecutor  as a \"much more honest guy\" than his predecessor, Viktor Shokin. After Lutsenko was removed from office, he said in September 2019 that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and that he had met Giuliani about ten times. Giuliani then reversed his stance, saying that Shokin is the one people \"should have spoken to\", while Lutsenko acted \"corruptly\" and \"is exactly the prosecutor that Joe Biden put  order to tank the case\".\n\nIn September 2019, as reports surfaced that a whistleblower was alleging high-level misconduct related to Ukraine, Giuliani went on CNN to discuss the story. When asked if he had tried to get Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, he initially replied \"No, actually I didn't\", but thirty seconds later said, \"Of course I did\". In a later tweet he seemed to confirm reports that Trump had withheld military assistance funds scheduled for Ukraine unless they carried out the investigation. He said, \"The reality is that the president of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegationsour money is going to get squandered.\"\n\n, a former  in the Trump administration, described Giuliani's theory that Ukraine was involved in 2016 U.S. election interference as \"debunked\"; Giuliani responded that Bossert \"doesn't know what the hell he's talking about\".\n\nOn September 30, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to Giuliani asking him to release documents concerning the Ukraine scandal to Committee members by October 15, 2019. On October 2, 2019, , the State Department's inspector general, delivered a 40-page packet of apparent disinformation regarding former vice president  and former ambassador to Ukraine, , to Capitol Hill. Linick told congressional aides his office questioned , Pompeo's advisor about the origins of the packet. Brechbuhl noted the packet came to him from , who said it \"came over\", and Brechbuhl reportedly presumed it was from the White House. Later that day, Giuliani acknowledged he passed the packet to Pompeo regarding Ukraine and attacks on Yovanovitch. In a November 2019 interview he confirmed that he had \"needed Yovanovitch out of the way\" because she was going to make his investigations difficult. \"They (the State Department) told me they would investigate it,\" Giuliani added. Giuliani persuaded Trump to remove Yovanovitch from office in spring 2019. By April 2021, the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan was investigating the role of Giuliani and his associates in Yovanovitch's removal.\n\n  testified that Trump delegated American foreign policy on Ukraine to Giuliani. The late 2019  centered around Giuliani's actions involving Ukraine. In the compiled testimony and in the December reports of the , Giuliani's name was mentioned more than any but Trump's. Some experts suggested that Giuliani may have violated the .\n\nOn November 22, 2019, Giuliani sent a letter to Senator , chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, informing him of at least three witnesses from Ukraine who Giuliani said had direct oral, documentary, and recorded evidence of Democratic criminal conspiracy with Ukrainians to prevent Trump's election and, after his election, to remove him from office via contrived charges. Giuliani's letter also claims that the witnesses had evidence of the Biden family's involvement in bribery, money laundering, Hobbs Act extortion, and other possible crimes. The letter sought Graham's help obtaining U.S. visas for the witnesses to testify. The next month, Graham invited Giuliani to share his findings with the Judiciary Committee, and soon advised him \"to share what he got from Ukraine with the [intelligence community] to make sure it's not Russia propaganda\".\n\n is a  who is prominent in the natural gas sector. In 2017, the Justice Department characterized him as being an \"upper echelon (associate) of Russian organized crime\". Since his 2014 arrest in , at the request of American authorities, he has been living there on $155&nbsp;million bail while fighting extradition to the United States on bribery and racketeering charges, and has been seeking to have the charges dropped. Firtash's attorneys obtained a September 2019 statement from Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was forced out under pressure from multiple countries and non-governmental organizations, as conveyed to Ukraine by Joe Biden. Shokin falsely asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into Burisma. Giuliani, who asserts he has \"nothing to do with\" and has \"never met or talked to\" Firtash, promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Giuliani told CNN he met with a Firtash attorney for two hours in New York City at the time he was seeking information about the Bidens.\n\nFirtash is represented by Trump and Giuliani associates  and his wife , having hired them on Parnas's recommendation in July 2019. ''The New York Times'' reported in November 2019 that Giuliani had directed Parnas to approach Firtash with the recommendation, with the proposition that Firtash could help provide damaging information on Biden, which Parnas' attorney described was \"part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter\". Shokin's statement notes that it was prepared \"at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash ('DF'), for use in legal proceedings in Austria\". Giuliani presented the Shokin statement during American television appearances. ''Bloomberg News'' reported on October 18 that during the summer of 2019 Firtash associates began attempting to dig up dirt on the Bidens in an effort to solicit Giuliani's assistance with Firtash's legal matters. ''Bloomberg News'' also reported that its sources told them Giuliani's high-profile publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political ''quid pro quo''. diGenova has said he has known U.S. Attorney General  for thirty years, as they both worked in the Reagan Justice Department. ''The Washington Post'' reported on October 22 that after they began representing Firtash, Toensing and diGenova secured a rare face-to-face meeting with Barr to argue the Firtash charges should be dropped, but he declined to intervene.\n\nOn October 18, ''The New York Times'' reported that weeks earlier, before his associates Parnas and Fruman were indicted, Giuliani met with officials with the criminal and fraud divisions of the Justice Department regarding what Giuliani characterized as a \"very, very sensitive\" foreign bribery case involving a client of his. The ''Times'' did not name whom the case involved, but shortly after publication of the story Giuliani told a reporter it was not Firtash. Two days later, the Justice Department said its officials would not have met with Giuliani had they known his associates were under investigation by the .\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee's report included phone records acquired via subpoenas, including numerous phone calls made by Giuliani between April and August 2019. Calls involved Giuliani in contact with Kurt Volker, Republican representative and House Intelligence Committee ranking member , Lev Parnas, numbers associated with the Office of Management and Budget and the White House switchboard, and an unidentified White House official whose phone number is referenced as \"-1\". Chairman  of the House Intelligence Committee announced after the report's release that his committee was investigating whether \"-1\" referred to President Trump, citing grand jury evidence from the trial of convicted Trump-associate  in which the phone number \"-1\" was shown to have referred to Trump.

U.S. officials told ''The Washington Post'' that Giuliani would have been considered a target of Russian intelligence efforts from early in Trump's presidency, and particularly after Giuliani turned his focus to Ukrainea former Soviet republic under  and with deep penetration by Russian intelligence services. Analysts say Trump's and Giuliani's habit of communicating over unencrypted lines makes it highly likely that foreign intelligence agencies could be listening in on the president's unsecured calls with Giuliani; and that foreign intelligence agencies often collect intelligence about a primary target through monitoring communications of other people who interact with that target.\n\n''NBC News'' reported in December 2020 that  investigators, which were reported in late 2019 to be investigating Giuliani's activities, had discussed with Justice Department officials in Washington the possibility of acquiring Giuliani's emails, which might require headquarters approval due to protection by . ''The New York Times'' reported in February 2021 that the SDNY had requested a search warrant of Giuliani's electronic records in summer 2020, but were met with resistance from high-level political appointees in the Washington headquarters, ostensibly because the election was near, while career officials were supportive of the search warrant. The Justice Department generally avoids taking significant actions relating to political figures that might become public within sixty days of an election. Senior political appointees nevertheless opposed the effort after the election, noting Giuliani played a leading role in challenging the election results. The officials deferred the matter to the incoming Biden administration.\n\nFederal investigators in Manhattan executed search warrants on the early morning of April 28, 2021, at Giuliani's office and Upper East Side apartment, seizing his electronic devices and searching the apartment. FBI agents also executed a search warrant that day on Toensing's Washington, D.C.-area home and confiscated her cellphone. In April 2021, Giuliani's attorney said investigators told him they had searched his client's  account beginning in late 2019, later arguing to a judge that the search was illegal and so the subsequent raid on Giuliani's properties was \"fruit of this poisoned tree,\" demanding to review documents justifying the iCloud search. In May 2021, the  confirmed in a court filing that in late 2019 it obtained search warrants for Giuliani's iCloud account, and that of Toensing, as part of \"an ongoing, multi-year grand jury investigation into conduct involving Giuliani, Toensing, and others,\" and argued that attorneys for Giuliani and Toensing were not entitled to review the underlying documents of the warrants prior to any charges. Giuliani and Toensing asserted their  with clients may have been violated by the iCloud searches, which investigators disputed, saying they employed a \"\" to prevent them from seeing information potentially protected by attorney-client privilege. Federal judge  days later ruled in favor of investigators regarding the warrant documents and granted their request for a  to ensure attorney-client privilege was maintained. The special master released more than 3,000 of Giuliani's communications to prosecutors in January 2022, agreeing to withhold forty messages for which Giuliani had asserted \"privilege and/or highly personal\" status and rejecting 37 such assertions.\n\n''The New York Times'' reported in February 2021 that the  was scrutinizing Giuliani's association with Firtash in efforts to discredit the Bidens, and efforts to lobby the Trump administration on behalf of Ukrainian officials and oligarchs. '''' reported in May 2021 it had spoken with three unidentified witnesses who said they were questioned by investigators, two of whom said they had worked with Giuliani while cooperating with investigators; one witness said investigators were particularly interested in Giuliani's association with Firtash.\n\n analysis released in March 2021 found that Ukrainian politician  was among proxies of Russian intelligence who promoted and  misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Biden \"to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration\". Giuliani met with Derkach in December 2019.\n\nIn April 2021, ''Forensic News'' reported that the SDNY investigation into Giuliani had expanded to include a criminal probe of Derkach and . ''The New York Times'' confirmed weeks later that Derkach was the subject of a criminal investigation into foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections. \"Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have been investigating whether several Ukrainian officials helped orchestrate a wide-ranging plan to meddle in the 2020 presidential campaign, including using Rudolph W. Giuliani to spread their misleading claims about President Biden and tilt the election in Donald J. Trump's favor\", the ''Times'' reported.\n\nOn June 8, 2021,  uncovered exclusive audio of a 2019 phone call from Giuliani to Ukraine, stating that \"Rudy Giuliani relentlessly pressured and coaxed the Ukrainian government in 2019 to investigate  about then-candidate .\"\n\n''The New York Times'' reported in August 2022 that SDNY was unlikely to indict Giuliani for his activities in Ukraine. Prosecutors confirmed this in a court filing three months later.\n\n\n\n in November 2020]]\nIn November 2020, Trump placed Giuliani in charge of lawsuits related to alleged voter irregularities in the . On November 7, Giuliani  in Philadelphia to discuss challenging the vote count in Pennsylvania, during which media networks called the presidential election for Biden.  Trump designated Giuliani to lead a legal team to challenge the election results, telling Giuliani to \"go wild\" and \"do anything you want\" in his efforts to overturn them. This teama self-described \"elite strike force\" that included , , , and Trump campaign attorney appeared at a November 19 press conference in which they made numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international Communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines, and polling place fraud.\n\nGiuliani repeatedly publicly denounced the use of s (in which the poll worker does not see the voter's name on the rolls, so the voter swears an affidavit oath that they are registered to vote), arguing that the practice enables fraud, although Giuliani himself had cast this type of ballot on October 31, 2020, in Manhattan.\n\nBy January 8, 2021, Trump and his team had lost 63 lawsuits. Giuliani's associate Maria Ryan sent a letter to White House chief of staff  requesting that Giuliani be paid $2.5&nbsp;million and receive a \"general \". A month later, when Trump was out of office, Giuliani was no longer representing him in any pending cases, according to a Trump adviser. While Trump continued to fundraise, purportedly for his election-related legal fights, as of the end of July 2021 he had not given any of this money to Giuliani. In October 2021, in another context, Trump remarked: \"I do pay my lawyers when they do a good job.\"\n\n\nOne early lawsuit sought to invalidate up to 700,000 mail-in ballots and stop Pennsylvania from certifying its election results. Giuliani said he had signed affidavits attesting to voter fraud and election official misconduct in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Despite not having argued a case in any courtroom for over three decades, Giuliani applied for special permission to represent the Trump presidential campaign in the federal court of Pennsylvania. In doing so, Giuliani misrepresented his status with the District of Columbia Bar in his application by stating that he was a member of the  in good standing, when in fact the District of Columbia had suspended him for nonpayment of fees. In his first day in court on the case, which was November 17, 2020, Giuliani struggled with rudimentary legal processes and was accused by lawyers for the Pennsylvania Secretary of State of making legal arguments that were \"disgraceful in an American courtroom\". Judge  questioned how Giuliani could justify \"asking this court to invalidate some 6.8&nbsp;million votes thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the commonwealth.\"\n\nHis federal lawsuit against Pennsylvania was dismissed  on November 21, 2020, with the judge citing \"strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations\" which were \"unsupported by evidence\". Giuliani and Jenna Ellis reacted by stating that the ruling \"helps\" the Trump campaign \"get expeditiously to the U.S. Supreme Court\". They also pointed out that the judge, , was \"Obama-appointed\", though Brann is also a Republican and a former member of the right-leaning .\n\nThe Trump campaign appealed the lawsuit to the , where a three-judge panel on November 27 rejected the Trump campaign's attempt to undo Pennsylvania's vote certification, because the Trump campaign's \"claims have no merit\". The panel also ruled that the District Court was correct in preventing the Trump campaign from conducting a second amendment of its complaint. An amendment would be pointless, ruled the judges, because the Trump campaign was not bringing facts before the court, and not even alleging fraud. Judge  highlighted that Giuliani himself told the district court that the Trump campaign \"doesn't plead fraud\", and that this \"is not a fraud case\". The panel concluded that neither \"specific allegations\" nor \"proof\" was provided in this case, and that the Trump campaign \"cannot win this lawsuit\".\n\nGiuliani and Ellis reacted to the appeals court ruling by condemning the \"activist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania\". Of the three Appeal Court judges, Stephanos Bibas, who delivered the opinion, was appointed by Trump himself, while judges  and  were appointed by Republican president .\n\n\n\nAs part of Giuliani's allegations that voting machines had been rigged, he made several false assertions about two rival companies,  and . These false claims included that Smartmatic owned Dominion; that Dominion voting machines used Smartmatic software; that Dominion voting machines sent vote data to Smartmatic at foreign locations; that Dominion was founded by the former socialist Venezuelan leader ; and that Dominion is a \"radical-left\" company with connections to .\n\nBoth companies sued Giuliani and Fox News. Dominion filed a defamation lawsuit against Giuliani in January 2021, and separately sued Fox News for $1.6 billion. Fox News settled the case, '''', for $787.5&nbsp;million; the company's lawsuits against Giuliani and  for their election-related lies are still active .\n\nOn February 4, 2021, Smartmatic sued Giuliani, Fox News and some of its hosts, and Powell, accusing them of engaging in a \"disinformation campaign\" against the company; the company sought $2.7billion in damages. A New York State Supreme Court judge, in March 2022, denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, ruling that the Smartmatic's defamation suit against Fox News and Giuliani could proceed; however, the court dismissed two of the sixteen counts against Giuliani. In February 2023, the  reinstated the two counts.\n\nOn September 10, 2021, Fox News told Giuliani that neither he nor his son Andrew would be allowed on their network for nearly three months.\n\n\nIn December 2021, two Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, sued Giuliani for defamation, after Giuliani falsely accused them of manipulating vote tallies. He has accused them of \"passing around  as if they were vials of heroin or cocaine\" and engaging in \"surreptitious illegal activity,\" citing video footage that, according to Moss, actually showed the women with \"a ginger \".  before the  that after Giuliani's remarks she and her family were subjected to a barrage of racist threats, including \"Be glad it's 2020 and not 1920,\" in reference to .\n\nIn July 2023, Giuliani was ordered to pay attorneys' fees to the election workers after being sanctioned for failing to turn over evidence in the case. Later that month, Giuliani admitted his statements had been \"defamatory per se\" yet denied they had caused \"any damages\". On August 4, the judge asked him to explain why he was still fighting the lawsuit, given his admission. Due to his failure to produce documents, U.S. District Judge  issued an order on August 30 ruling that he forfeited his case by . Meanwhile, the court increased what he owed for the plaintiffs' legal fees, and he did not immediately pay. The plaintiffs subsequently requested money to cover additional attorneys' fees that arose from discovery disputes during the case. The judge again increased what Giuliani owed; the total was over $230,000.\n\nOn October 13, the judge said that due to Giuliani's \"continued and flagrant disregard of this Court's August 30 Order that he produce financial-related documents concerning his personal and his businesses' past and present assets\", she would tell the jurors that he intentionally hid financial documents in defiance of court orders. On December 5, 2023, Giuliani did not appear at a federal court pretrial hearing. Freeman and Moss attended. Giuliani's lawyer, Joseph Sibley IV, told the judge he had not understood that Giuliani's presence was required and that it was \"my mistake\"; the judge criticized Giuliani's failure to appear.\n\nThe trial began on December 11. During the trial on the amount of damages, the plaintiffs' testified that Giuliani's false statements, beginning with one of his tweets, prompted a barrage of threatening phone calls and messages against them, including many that were violent, vulgar, or racist. They also testified that Giuliani's lies caused others to show up at Freeman's home, to attempt to conduct a \"\" of Moss at her grandmother's home, and to barrage Moss' teenage son with cell phone messages. During the trial, Giuliani publicly repeated his false claim that Freeman and Moss \"were engaged in changing votes\" and claimed that \"When I testify, the whole story will be definitively clear that what I said was true.\" However, Giuliani ultimately declined to testify, and his defense team called no witnesses. Giuliani's attorney pointed to another defamation lawsuit Freeman and Moss had filed against '''', saying the website had likely instigated the harassment against them.\n\nOn December 15, 2023, the federal jury ordered Giuliani to pay $148&nbsp;million to Freeman and Moss, including $75&nbsp;million in . After the verdict, Giuliani said he regretted nothing and said he would appeal. One of his lawyers suggested he would file for bankruptcy. On December 20, concerned that Giuliani would hide his assets given the \"ample record in this case of Giuliani’s efforts to conceal or hide his assets,\" Judge Beryl A. Howell ordered swift payment of the damages. On December 21, he filed for bankruptcy.\n\nOn December 18, Freeman and Moss sued Giuliani again, seeking an injunction to permanently prohibit him from defaming them. They later agreed to drop this lawsuit in exchange for Giuliani's promise never again to state, imply, or assist others' remarks that they \"engaged in wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election\".\n\nIn January 2024, Freeman and Moss accused Giuliani of taking unfair advantage of the bankruptcy system in a court filing, with their attorneys calling Giuliani's approach \"a flawed, impermissible litigation tactic from an actor with a history of engaging the judicial system in bad faith.\" In February, Giuliani testified about his finances. In March, creditors filed a motion to force him to sell his Florida condo to pay the judgment. In April, he lost his bid to dismiss the judgment against him. A bankruptcy court hearing was set for July 10 to address his creditors' request to put his funds under the control of an independent trustee so they could begin to collect what they were owed. On July 12, the judge, citing Giuliani's lack of transparency over the previous six months of litigation, said he was no longer entitled to bankruptcy protection. On July 31, Giuliani and his creditors revised their agreement.\n\nOn October 22, a federal judge in Manhattan ordered Giuliani to turn over his $6 million Manhattan penthouse apartment and other valuable possessions to Freeman and Moss. Giuliani may also need to surrender his $3.5 million primary residence in Palm Beach, Florida. On October 29, Giuliani told the court that his valuables were “being held for wherever Plaintiffs request.” On October 31, Freeman and Moss visited Giuliani’s apartment so they could see the property inside, as they needed to assess how they would move and store it. They discovered that, four weeks earlier, the apartment had been emptied of \"the vast majority (if not all) of the valuable receivership property that was known to be stored there,\" a fact that, as they told the court, \"neither Defendant nor Defendant’s counsel had bothered to mention.\" Giuliani's lawyers told them that some unspecified property was in a storage facility on  and that his vintage Mercedes (formerly owned by ) was somewhere in Florida. Additionally, Giuliani’s lawyers provided bank statements showing that a large amount of money had been transferred out of his bank account in July and August and that less than $4,000 remained in the account.\n\nAt an in-person hearing on November 7, Giuliani's lawyer proposed that the Mercedes might be worth under $4,000, meaning that Giuliani would be allowed to keep it. Giuliani claimed he had no idea of the whereabouts of his other valuables. The judge gave Giuliani until November 15 to turn over his property to the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Giuliani spoke at a \"Save America March\" rally on  that was attended by Trump supporters protesting the election results. He repeated conspiracy theories that voting machines used in the election were \"crooked\" and called for \"\", which he claimed after the riot had not been a call to violence but a reference to ''''. Trump supporters subsequently  in a riot that resulted in the deaths of four people, and temporarily disrupted the .\n\nGiuliani had reportedly been calling Republican lawmakers to urge them to delay the electoral vote count in order to ultimately throw the election to Trump. Giuliani attempted to contact Alabama Sen. , a Trump ally, around 7:00p.m. on January 6, after the Capitol storming, to ask him to \"try to just slow it down\" by objecting to multiple states and \"raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrowideally until the end of tomorrow\". However, Giuliani mistakenly left the message on the voicemail of another senator, who leaked the recording to ''''. , a noted historian of the American conservative political movement, termed Giuliani's attempts to slow certification in the wake of the riot as treasonous. \"Sedition. Open and shut. He talked about the time that was being opened up. He was welcoming, and using, the violence. This needs to be investigated,\" Perlstein tweeted on January 11, 2021.\n\nGiuliani faced criticism for his appearance at the rally and the Capitol riot that followed it. Former Congressman and   called for the arrest of Giuliani, President Trump, and  Manhattan College president Brennan O'Donnell stated in a January7 open letter to the college community, \"one of the loudest voices fueling the anger, hatred, and violence that spilled out yesterday is a graduate of our College, Rudolph Giuliani. His conduct as a leader of the campaign to de-legitimize the election and disenfranchise millions of votershas been and continues to be a repudiation of the deepest values of his alma mater.\"\n\nOn January 11, the , an advocacy group for the legal profession in New York state, announced that it was launching an investigation into whether Giuliani should be removed from its membership rolls, noting both Giuliani's comments to the Trump supporter rally at the Ellipse on January 6, and that it \"has received hundreds of complaints in recent months about Mr. Giuliani and his baseless efforts on behalf of President Trump to cast doubt on the veracity of the 2020 presidential election and, after the votes were cast, to overturn its legitimate results\". Removal from the group's membership rolls would not directly disbar Giuliani from practicing law in New York. New York State Sen.  and lawyers' group Lawyers Defending American Democracy, also filed a complaints against Giuliani with the Attorney Grievance Committee of the First Judicial Department of the , which has the authority to discipline and disbar licensed New York lawyers.\n\nAlso on January 11, 2021, District of Columbia Attorney General  said that he is looking at whether to charge Giuliani, along with  and Representative , with inciting the violent attack.\n\nOn January 29, 2021, Giuliani said falsely that  played a role in the organization of the Capitol riot. In response,  threatened to sue Giuliani for defamation.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Representative  filed a civil lawsuit against Giuliani and three others (, , and Representative ), seeking damages for their alleged role in inciting the Capitol riot.\n\nResponding to a January 2022 subpoena from the , Giuliani testified on May 20, 2022.\n\n\nOn August 1, 2023, the Justice Department's special counsel investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election charged Trump with four criminal counts related to those efforts. News reports widely identified Rudy Giuliani as the unnamed \"Co-Conspirator 1\" (of six) mentioned at least 46 times in the 45-page indictment. In a statement, Giuliani's lawyer, Robert J. Costello, acknowledged that it “appears that Mayor Giuliani is alleged to be co-conspirator No. 1.”\n\nOn August 14, 2023, Giuliani was indicted, along with Donald Trump and 17 others, by an Atlanta, Georgia, grand jury. The 41-count indictment charged the group of 19 under state racketeering laws for conspiring to \"change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump.\" Giuliani's false testimony, in December 2020, to Georgia lawmakers about election fraud is among the events listed in the indictment. His lawyer (at least for the arraignment) is Brian Tevis. Giuliani turned himself in at the Fulton County Sheriff's Office on August 23, 2023. On September 9, he filed to have the charges against him quashed.\n\nIn April 2024, Giuliani was also among 18 people who were indicted on . By mid-May, Giuliani was the only defendant yet to be  with a summons to court for this case, with prosecutors stating that they had mailed Giuliani the documents with no response, called Giuliani's telephone with no response, and visited his apartment building but were \"not granted access\"; Giuliani responded: \"Arizona officials say they can't find Giuliani. So this is perfect evidence that if they're so incompetent, they can't find me, they also can't count votes correctly\". On May 17, during his early 80th birthday celebration, Giuliani posted on social media a photo of himself smiling in a group of people along with balloons, with Giuliani writing: \"If Arizona authorities can't find me by tomorrow morning; 1. They must dismiss the indictment\"; around one hour later, Arizona's Attorney General  announced that Giuliani had been successfully served, while Giuliani's spokesperson responded by criticizing the \"decision to try and embarrass [Giuliani] during his 80th birthday party\". On May 21, 2024, Giuliani and ten other co-defendants pled not guilty after being arraigned in . However, Giuliani was among five of these eleven defendants who appeared virtually rather than in-person. The same day, Giuliani was ordered to post a $10,000 bond and was required to book himself into the custody of the  within 30 days as a result of him ducking efforts by the state to serve him with a  within the past week; In contrast to Giuliani, all of the other ten defendants would be released without bond.\n\n\nOn June 24, 2021,  suspended Giuliani's law license. The panel of five justices found that there was \"uncontroverted\" evidence that Giuliani made \"demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public\" and that \"These false statements were made to improperly bolster (Giuliani's) narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client.\" The court concluded that Giuliani's conduct \"immediately threatens the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law\". His license was also suspended in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 2021.\n\nOn July 2, 2024, a New York state appeals court disbarred Giuliani as a result of his efforts to subvert the 2020 election by making false allegations about mass voter fraud.\n\n\nOn June 10, 2022, the 's Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed charges with the ' Board on Professional Responsibility against Giuliani. The ethics charges say that Giuliani's federal court filings regarding the  contained baseless claims in favor of Trump.\n\nOn December 15, 2022, after a week-long hearing, the D.C. Bar Disciplinary Counsel recommended Giuliani be disbarred for violating rules of professional conduct by making false election fraud claims and trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Pennsylvania. The counsel's decision is preliminary and non-binding. On July 7, 2023, an ad hoc hearing committee of the Board on Professional Responsibility recommended that he be disbarred, and on May 31, 2024, the board itself agreed. He was disbarred by the DC Court of Appeals on September 26, 2024.\n\n\nOn June 27, 2022, Giuliani appeared at ShopRite, a supermarket in Staten Island, campaigning on behalf of his son Andrew, who was attempting to become the Republican nominee for governor of New York. After Giuliani's appearance, a 39-year-old supermarket employee, Daniel Gill, was arrested and charged with second-degree assault for allegedly slapping Giuliani's back in the store. Giuliani responded publicly that it was like \"a boulder hit me\" or \"like somebody shot me\"; \"it hurt tremendously\". Giuliani further stated that the \"very, very heavy shot\" by Gill caused him to stumble and \"could've easily ... knocked me to the ground and killed me by my head getting hit\", and called for Gill's firing and prosecution. The Legal Aid Society, representing Gill, asserted that Giuliani had exaggerated the severity of the slap in order to garner greater amounts of attention from the media: \"Our client merely patted Mr. Giuliani, who sustained nothing remotely resembling physical injuries, without malice to simply get his attention, as the video footage clearly showed,\" the Legal Aid Society stated in a press release.\n\nWithin a day of the incident, ''The New York Post'' posted video footage of it. ''The New York Times'' described that the video \"contradicted\" Giuliani's account, showing Gill walking quickly past Giuliani, \"patting him on the back\", whereby Giuliani \"wobbled slightly forward\". ''The Hill'' described that the \"video shows Giuliani barely moving after a ShopRite employee's hand makes contact with his back\", while Giuliani responded that the \"videotape that you see is probably a little deceptive\", stressing that he was \"hit very, very hard on the back. To such an extent that it knocked me back about two steps.\"\n\nAfter the video was released, Gill's charge was reduced to third-degree assault on June 28, while third-degree menacing and second-degree harassment charges were simultaneously added. Gill acknowledged telling Giuliani: \"What's up, scumbag?\" during the incident. In September 2022, Gill agreed to an , whereby all charges would be dismissed if he does not violate the law in the next six months.\n\nIn May 2023, Gill sued Giuliani, seeking monetary damages \"for , civil rights conspiracy resulting in false arrest and false imprisonment, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress\".\n\n\nOn May 15, 2023, Noelle Dunphy, a former off-the-books employee of Giuliani, filed a civil lawsuit against him. She accused Giuliani of sexual assault, wage theft and unlawful abuse of power. Dunphy claimed that sexually satisfying Giuliani was an \"absolute requirement\" of her job; the complaint also said that Giuliani \"often made outrageous comments that created and added to the hostile work environment that Ms. Dunphy was forced to endure,\" and that he was constantly under the effects of alcohol. The lawsuit further alleges Giuliani complained about \"'freakin Arabs' and Jews,\" and \"implied that [Jewish men's] penises were inferior due to 'natural selection.'\" The lawsuit also alleges that Giuliani and  sold pardons for $2&nbsp;million apiece.\n\nIn her 2023 memoir ,  alleges that Giuliani  her backstage during Donald Trump's speech on January 6, 2021.\n\n\nIn September 2023, law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron sued Giuliani for over $1.3&nbsp;million in unpaid legal fees. The firm alleged that Giuliani had paid only $214,000 of his total legal bill between November 2019 and July 2023. Giuliani said in a statement that the firm's bill \"is way in excess to anything approaching legitimate fees.\"\n\nAlso in September 2023,  filed a civil lawsuit against Giuliani, his companies and attorney Robert Costello, alleging that they had spent years \"hacking into, tampering with, manipulating, copying, disseminating, and generally obsessing over data that they were given that was taken or stolen from\" his personal devices and caused \"total annihilation\" of his digital privacy. Biden dropped the lawsuit in June 2024.\n\nIn October 2023, Giuliani filed a defamation lawsuit in  against President  for referring to him as a \"Russian pawn\" during a . Giuliani alleged that Biden's comments were false and that he had been personally harmed by them. Giuliani did not respond to a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in March 2024. The lawsuit was dismissed in September, with the judge saying that Giuliani had \"utterly failed\" to carry his burden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the New York City mayor's office, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners LLC, in 2002, a firm that has been categorized by multiple media outlets as a lobbying entity capitalizing on Giuliani's name recognition, and which has been the subject of allegations surrounding staff hired by Giuliani and due to the firm's chosen client base. Over five years, Giuliani Partners earned more than $100million.\n\nIn June 2007, he stepped down as CEO and chairman of Giuliani Partners, although this action was not made public until December 4, 2007; he maintained his equity interest in the firm. Giuliani subsequently returned to active participation in the firm following the election. In late 2009, Giuliani announced that they had a security consulting contract with , Brazil regarding the . He faced criticism in 2012 for advising people once allied with  who had lauded Serbian war criminals.\n and Giuliani at a joint press conference, 2012]]\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Giuliani joined the law firm of Bracewell & Patterson LLP (renamed Bracewell & Giuliani LLP) as a name partner and basis for the expanding firm's new New York office. When he joined the Texas-based firm he brought Marc Mukasey, the son of  , into the firm.\n\nDespite a busy schedule, Giuliani was highly active in the day-to-day business of the law firm, which was a high-profile supplier of legal and lobbying services to the oil, gas, and energy industries. Its aggressive defense of pollution-causing coal-fired power plants threatened to cause political risk for Giuliani, but association with the firm helped Giuliani achieve fund-raising success in Texas. In 2006, Giuliani acted as the lead counsel and lead spokesmen for Bracewell & Giuliani client , the makers of , during their negotiations with federal prosecutors over charges that the pharmaceutical company misled the public about OxyContin's addictive properties. The agreement reached resulted in Purdue Pharma and some of its executives paying $634.5million in fines.\n\nBracewell & Giuliani represented corporate clients before many U.S. government departments and agencies. Some clients have worked with corporations and foreign governments.\n\nGiuliani left the firm in January 2016, by \"amicable agreement\", and the firm was rebranded as Bracewell LLP.\n\n\nIn January 2016, Giuliani moved to the law firm , where he served as the global chairman for Greenberg's cybersecurity and crisis management group, as well as a senior advisor to the firm's executive chairman. He took an unpaid leave of absence in April 2018 when he joined Trump's legal defense team. He resigned from the firm on May 9, 2018.\n\n\nIn August 2018, Giuliani was retained by , a global consulting firm run by former FBI Director , which paid him a fee to lobby Romanian president  to change Romania's anti-corruption policy and reduce the role of the . Giuliani argued that the anti-corruption efforts had gone too far.\n\n\nGiuliani launched a podcast, ''Rudy Giuliani's Common Sense'', in January 2020.\n\n\nGiuliani was reportedly revealed to be the first unmasking on the  of '''', which caused judges  and  to leave the set in disgust. Giuliani actually turned out to be the ninth unmasking as \"Jack in the Box\" of Team Bad. He mentioned that he partook in this show to do it for his newborn granddaughter. It was during his unmasked performance of 's \"\" when Jeong walked off.\n\n\n\n\n, former First Lady , and Giuliani, 2002]]\n\nGiuliani married , his second cousin, whom he had known since childhood, on October 26, 1968. The marriage was in trouble by the mid-1970s and they agreed to a trial separation in 1975. Peruggi did not accompany him to Washington when he accepted the job in the 's Office. Giuliani met local television personality  sometime in 1982, and they began dating when she was working in Miami. Giuliani filed for  from Peruggi on August 12, 1982. The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage legally ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued by the end of 1982, while a Roman Catholic church  of the marriage was granted at the end of 1983, reportedly because Giuliani had discovered that he and Peruggi were . , Giuliani's best man, later became a priest and helped secure the annulment. Giuliani and Peruggi had no children.\n\nGiuliani married Hanover at  church in Manhattan on April 15, 1984. They had two children:  and , who is a filmmaker in the LGBTQ+ community and has described herself as \"multiverses apart\" from her father.\n major poses with Rudy and Judith Giuliani at  in April 2009]]\n\nGiuliani was still married to Hanover in May 1999 when he met , a sales manager for a pharmaceutical company, at , an  . By 1996, Donna Hanover had reverted to her professional name and virtually stopped appearing in public with her husband amid rumors of marital problems. Nathan and Giuliani formed an ongoing relationship. In summer 1999, Giuliani charged the costs for his  security detail to obscure city agencies in order to keep his relationship with Nathan from public scrutiny. The police department began providing Nathan with city-provided chauffeur services in early 2000.\n\nBy March 2000, Giuliani had stopped wearing his wedding ring. The appearances that he and Nathan made at functions and events became publicly visible, although they were not mentioned in the press. The '''' and the '''' both broke news of Giuliani's relationship with Nathan in early May 2000. Giuliani first publicly acknowledged her on May 3, 2000, when he said Judith was his \"very good friend\".\n\nOn May 10, 2000, Giuliani held a press conference to announce that he intended to separate from Hanover. Giuliani had not informed Hanover about his plans before the press conference. This was an omission for which Giuliani was widely criticized. Giuliani then went on to praise Nathan as a \"very, very fine woman\" and said about Hanover that \"over the course of some period of time in many ways, we've grown to live independent and separate lives.\" Hours later Hanover said, \"I had hoped that we could keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member,\" in reference to another woman who worked on Giuliani's staff.\n\nGiuliani moved out of  by August 2001 and into an apartment with a couple he was friends with. Giuliani filed for divorce from Hanover in October 2000, and a public battle broke out between their representatives. Nathan was barred by court order from entering Gracie Mansion or meeting his children before the divorce was final.\n\nIn May 2001, Giuliani's attorney revealed that Giuliani was  due to  treatments and had not had sex with Nathan for the preceding year. \"You don't get through treatment for cancer and  all by yourself,\" Giuliani said. \"You need people to help you and care for you and support you. And I'm very fortunate I had a lot of people who did that, but nobody did more to help me than Judith Nathan.\" In a court case, Giuliani argued that he planned to introduce Nathan to his children on  2001 and that Hanover had prevented this visit. Giuliani and Hanover finally settled their divorce case in July 2002 after his mayoralty had ended, with Giuliani paying Hanover a $6.8million  and granting her custody of their children. Giuliani married Nathan on May 24, 2003, and gained a stepdaughter, Whitney.

The Senator was later arrested, tried, and convicted on several counts of Federal corruption charges. Ball had often accused the Senator of using the office as his \"personal piggy bank.\"  The feud between Leibell and Ball dated back to the 2008 election, when Ball first accused the Senator of orchestrating a \"smear campaign\" against him.  \n\nOn August 26, 2008, a local newspaper known as ''The Putnam Times'' published court documents surrounding the breakup between Ball and a Washington, D.C., woman in 2003. Ball blamed Leibell for hiring private investigators for the newspaper article, and for funding the campaign of his Democratic challenger, John Degnan. Ball stated both he and the woman both filed for orders of protection following the end of their relationship. In November 2003, both Ball and the woman asked the court to dismiss their complaints against each other, which was done. Ball told ''The Daily News'' that \"It was just a heartfelt breakup where both parties jointly requested a 'cooling off' period, and the entire matter was mutually dismissed. My life is an open book, and always has been.\"\n\nWhile ''The Putnam Times'', a local paper incorrectly reported that Ball violated the order of protection by following the woman to Israel on July 20, ''News Channel 12'', a regional network, pointed out that order of protection was filed six days earlier on July 14, and court records state Ball traveled to Israel on June 20. ''The Poughkeepsie Journal'' also later pointed out that there was never a criminal restraining order, and the documents printed by the ''Times'' was actually a , which anyone can request.\n\nFollowing the revelations that Ball's ex-girlfriend filed for an order of protection against him in 2003, on September 3, 2008, the ''Journal News'' reported that a former member of Ball's staff had accused him of sexually harassing her in a letter sent to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver detailing the incident. Perrault's accusations were later found to be fabrications and Ball was exonerated.\n\nInitially, ''News 12'' analyst Mike Edelman called the report \"not credible,\" and many questioned the timing of the complaint, as the former staff member waited a year to write the letter until a few days before the primary election. The previous day, Ball had released e-mails from his former Chief of Staff, which stated that Perreault was ready to \"go forward with a lawsuit and 'embellish' some of the details,\" calling the letter to Silver into question. Ball said the letter was part of a \"smear campaign\", and that the ex-Chief of Staff was a \"mole\" for State Senator Vincent Leibell, who was backing his primary opponent. Ball released a taped phone conversation between the ex-Chief of Staff and a local political candidate, where his former deputy stated he was working for \"the senate\" to \"neuter\" Ball. Although at first, the ex-Chief of Staff denied working for the senate to ''The Journal News'', the next day, he admitted it in another article, but Senator Leibell denied any conspiracy.Risinit, Michael. \"\".

The accuser, the 60-year-old Perrault, had been the target of numerous sexual harassment allegations at a prior job, where she was a supervisor. It was noted that Ball's accuser had herself settled four lawsuits for an undisclosed sum, at least three of which accused her of sexual harassment.\n\n\nIn May 2009, Ball announced he was a candidate for Congress in New York's 19th congressional district. Ball drew some attention by raising more money than incumbent Congressman John Hall in the second quarter of 2009. On November 21, 2009, Ball abandoned his Congressional run and decided to run for State Senate in District 40, the seat formerly held by .  In a letter to his supporters, Ball stated that the job of reforming Albany had not been completed, saying, \"From property tax reform to corruption in government, the job I set to do in 2006 is still incomplete, and it can only be accomplished by continuing to tackle our nation's most dysfunctional legislature.\"  Ball, who was opposed by the Republican Party operatives, defeated endorsed Republican candidate and  town supervisor Mary Beth Murphy in a primary election in September 2010. On November 2, 2010, Ball won election to the New York Senate from the  by a 52%-48% margin over , also from Somers.\n\n\nOn June 24, 2011, Ball voted against allowing same-sex marriage in New York during a senate roll-call vote on the Marriage Equality Act, which narrowly passed 33-29 and legalized marriages performed in the state regardless of the genders involved in the union.

These programs include consumer banking days (regular events that take place in every borough and feature workshops addressing savings and credit issues), predatory lending reforms and general investment strategies.\n\nIn an analysis of Thompson's use of the comptroller's office to audit city government, the on-line journal ''City Limits'' opined that \"Thompson has not been a ferocious antagonist to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Instead, he has mostly praised the mayor's budgets, smiled on his economic policies and hailed Bloomberg's accomplishments with the city's schools.\" , ''City Limits Weekly'', No. 693, July 13, 2009 However, ''City Limits'' reported the Comptroller's office and the Bloomberg administration in fact engaged in hundreds of \"low-level skirmishes\" over the Comptroller's audits of city agencies and programs, although Thompson did not audited the mayor's office and mayoral agencies as often as his predecessor, , under Mayor .

Thompson's report did not demonstrate any conclusive evidence of manipulation, \"saying only that a lack of oversight, coupled with intense pressure to push up the graduation rate, created the potential for abuse.\", ''New York Times'', July 21, 2009 Thompson also criticized Bloomberg's managerial style as creating incentives for schools to graduate unqualified students. The  released a 38-page rebuttal to Thompson's allegations.  In addition on July 21, 2009, Thompson said on  that School's Chancellor  should be fired, referring to his Department of Education as \"The Enron of American education.

They live in  with her children from a previous marriage.\n\n\nIn 1984, Levy was elected to the   where he served for 15 years (1985–2000). In 2000, he was elected to the , where he represented the 5th Assembly District from 2001 to 2003.\n\nLevy, then a Democrat who identified as fiscally conservative, ran for the office of Suffolk County Executive in 2003, winning the election against Republican opponent Edward Romaine. Levy entered office in 2004. On November 6, 2007, he was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term with cross-endorsement and receiving 96% of the vote.\n\nAs County Executive, Levy invested $15 million in affordable housing and infrastructure aid. Levy directed increased funding for solar energy projects, clean-fuel cars, and sewer construction. The county spent $42 million to double the sewer capacity for the Hauppauge industrial area, and $8 million in aid for sewer improvements and affordable housing for more than 500 new apartments. These investments sparked downtown revitalization in Patchogue.\n\nLevy transformed Suffolk's long-dormant  in  into a business park that is projected to create as many as 1,000 jobs. In addition, he helped resolve a land dispute that cleared the way for  US headquarters to relocate its North American headquarters to Melville, creating over 2,000 new jobs for the county.\n\nUnder Levy’s tenure, Suffolk County experienced a double-digit decrease in murders, burglaries and other violent crimes, which Levy attributed to an increased police presence on the street.\n\nThe Levy Administration kept general fund taxes flat and lowered the county's share of the overall property tax bill from 13 percent to 10 percent. Throughout his tenure, Suffolk County’s bond rating rose seven times, to record levels.\n\nLevy advocated for preserving open space to secure Suffolk’s clean drinking water. In support of Suffolk County’s tourism industry, he invested in conserving the county’s rustic nature and preserved over 70 of its farms.\n\nReflecting concerns of many residents in the county about rising numbers of undocumented immigrants, Levy has promoted policies to enforce immigration laws, including employer verification of worker status and restrictions on drivers’ licenses for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Levy announced that he would switch political parties, seeking the 's nomination for New York Governor, competing with former New York Congressman  and Buffalo developer  for the party nomination. Though he changed his voter registration to the Republican Party, this change came after the deadline for making such a change. For legal purposes, Levy remained a Democrat until November 2010, with the registration change taking effect after Election Day.\n\nLevy's platform focused on getting the state's financial house in order and reining in spending, while decreasing property taxes. He also called for the creation of an independent control board, much like the ones formed by the state for counties who are in financial crisis, to help address the state of New York's fiscal woes.\n\nDespite the support of state Republican chairman , Levy failed to gain the necessary support at the New York State Republican Convention for a \",\" the document necessary for non-party members to seek a party's nomination. Authorizing such a document requires a majority weighted vote of the attending members of the party; Levy received 42 percent, which barred him from entering the Republican primary, either by nomination or by petition.

Corwin was also the Republican Party nominee in the  held on May 24, 2011, to fill Western  seat in the  previously held by Republican . She faced three other candidates in the election, losing to Democrat  47 percent to 42 percent.\n\nBefore entering politics, Corwin was on the board of directors of the family business, and worked at a financial firm while earning her master's degree in business administration.\n\nIn 2019, she was confirmed by the Senate as a Commissioner of the International Joint Commission for United States and Canada.\n\n\nCorwin has said she spent 36 years working in the private sector, beginning her business career at age eight by delivering phone books for The Talking Phone Book, the family business that had been founded by her father, Wilbur Lewis, a former salesman. During her teen years, she  the company's publications, and while in college, she was vice president of . Corwin has stressed she did not grow up wealthy, noting that in the 1980s, her family almost lost their home.\n\nShe began college at the private  and had to transfer to the  because of cost concerns. She earned a  degree in psychology from SUNY in 1985, and then attended  earning an  in  in 1990.\n\nShe worked on  from 1987 to 1990 as a research director for Henry Ansbacher, Inc., a British financial firm that helped large media conglomerates acquire small, locally owned newspapers. She also served on the  of the Talking Phone Book as Secretary-Treasurer beginning in 1987, making strategic decisions for the company. After completing her education in 1990, she returned to Western New York State to marry Philip M. Corwin II whom she had met in graduate school. The couple worked at The Talking Phone Book with Philip serving as chief financial officer. She also began a family, and has said of this time, \"I didn't go into the office every day ... We had more board discussions over the kitchen table than the board room.\" The business was sold to  in 2004 for $400 million, making Corwin and her siblings wealthy, according to the ''Buffalo News''. Campaign disclosure forms have indicated Corwin's personal assets is between $58 and $158 million, mainly derived from her family's business.\n\n\nSince 2004, Corwin has been President of the Philip M. and Jane Lewis Corwin Foundation to provide direct funding to educational, medical and religious charities that benefit children. A review of the foundation's financials by the ''Buffalo News'' indicated that more than half of its distributions have gone to Boston College, Philip Corwin's ''alma mater''; the second largest recipient has been a school the Corwin children attended. In recent years, she has given $500 college scholarships to local public high school students, and has indicated she has not taken any tax benefits for her donations. She has also been a community volunteer, serving as president of a committee of the Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo, as confirmation leader at her church, and as a member of a committee of the Community Foundation for Greater Buffalo. She served on the board of directors of Brookfield Country Club Women's Association and became a private sector '''' of Erie   serving as an assistant treasurer for his campaign from 2007 to 2008, according to the ''Buffalo News''.\n\n\nCorwin has said she entered politics in 2008 because she \"could not stand idly by and watch state government spend away our children's future.\" During her first campaign for the Assembly, she said the State needed to adopt a business-like approach, cut spending, cut taxes, end \"unfunded mandates\" and improve the business environment. She won the primary for the 142nd Assembly District seat against three other Republican candidates including incumbent Assemblyman , who had the Republican party endorsement, but who had been censured for fraternizing with an intern one year earlier. Corwin went on to defeat  candidate Jeffrey Bono in the November 2008 , receiving 89 percent of the vote. She ran uncontested in the November 2010 general election, receiving endorsements from the  and  parties of New York State.\n\nWhile in the State Assembly, Corwin was appointed chair of the Assembly Minority Manufacturing Task Force and became ranking minority member of the Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee. She opposed a bill that would legalize gay marriage. She also opposed a loosening of state drug laws that would reduce long prison terms and give judges more leeway in sentencing, and voted \"no\" on a bill that required the unshackling of prisoners while giving birth. Based on her Assembly voting record on fiscal matters, the state Conservative Party placed her near the top in its 2009 and 2010 annual rankings of Assembly members.\n\n\n\nIn February 2011, U.S. Representative  resigned abruptly after reports surfaced that he had been flirting with a woman on . Later that month, Corwin was unanimously chosen by Republican Party leaders to be the Party's nominee in the  to fill the seat. (State law does not provide for primary elections prior to special elections.) Corwin also received the endorsements of the  and the . She vied for the congressional seat against local businessman , an independent candidate running on the Tea Party ballot line; Erie County Clerk , a Democrat; and writer  the Green Party candidate. The election was held on May 24.\n\n\nCorwin said that if elected, she would work to cut federal government spending, reduce taxes and repeal the  that was enacted by the Democratic majority Congress in 2010. She signed a tax pledge, promising to oppose all efforts to increase  rates on individuals and businesses, and to oppose reductions of s or  that are not matched by reductions in s.\n\nShe strongly supported U.S. Representative 's proposal to reform the  program for senior citizens by turning it into a program that would give seniors vouchers to purchase private health insurance coverage. Corwin said the plan would protect  for future generations by putting it on solid financial ground. On May 17, Corwin's campaign announced that Corwin would consider alternatives to the Ryan voucher plan, if they would help keep Medicare solvent. Corwin called her Democratic opponent's proposals to raise taxes on the wealthy an attack on those \"who help our jobs grow and who will keep Medicare from going into bankruptcy\", and has said that the Democrats, including Hochul, have offered no alternative to the Republicans' voucher plan.\n\nWhen answering 's \"Political Courage\" survey in 2008, Corwin replied that she believes abortion should be legal in the  and in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is endangered. When interviewed toward the end of her 2011 campaign for Congress, Corwin stated she would vote for any bill that restricted taxpayer funding of abortion, but indicated that abortion was \"a woman's decision in the first trimester.\"\n\n\nThe special election was initially thought to be a \"certain victory\" for the Republican candidate, but became \"fiercely competitive\", according to ''The New York Times'', because of a U.S. House Republican plan to  . The Times has also cited the candidacy of third-party candidate Davis as a factor which is \"siphoning support\" from Corwin. ''The Hill'' said the Medicare issue seemed to be boosting Hochul's campaign, though it was difficult to handicap the race because of the presence of the third-party candidate.\n\nA late April poll by  had Corwin in the lead with 36 percent, followed by Hochul with 31 percent and Davis with 23 percent of the vote. An early May poll by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Institute showed Hochul at 35 percent, Corwin at 31 percent and Davis at 24 percent. The non-partisan ''Rothenberg Political Report'' called the race a \"toss-up\" but tilting Democratic as of May 16. Additional polling by Siena and PPP in the days immediately preceding the election had Hochul leading by four and six point margins. Corwin ultimately lost to Hochul 47 to 43 percent in the special election. Independent candidate  received 9 percent, and Green Party candidate Ian Murphy received 1 percent of the vote.\n\nNational media attention was given to a 15-second video clip that appeared to show Corwin's Assembly chief of staff, Michael Mallia, repeatedly asking the 78-year-old Davis why he had skipped a campaign debate, followed by Mallia shrieking as Davis apparently shoved him or flapped at the camera. The video clip was circulated by local and national Republican organizations and prompted bipartisan criticism of both Davis and Mallia. Requests to see a longer tape and a tape made by second camera were refused by Corwin and her campaign. In an interview with the '''', Corwin said she thought the video was self-explanatory, and indicated that Mallia had been acting on his own free time, and not as her employee while he was tracking and taping her opponent, Davis. In response to Davis' complaints that he had been harassed, Corwin said, \"I've had cameras on me for two months now, and I've never hit anybody ... and I think that's the difference is how you handle a situation like that.\" One week after the election, Mallia resigned his position as Corwin's chief of staff as a result of the controversy.\n\nCorwin responded to attacks that she basically wants to eliminate Medicare, by airing an ad claiming her opponent Hochul wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare. Corwin's ad was based on Hochul's debate statement that budget talks should put everything on the table.

The  and TEA New York also endorsed Corwin with their leaders visiting Buffalo and Rochester to make it clear that Corwin was favored by the Tea Party, and to criticize Davis' use of the moniker.\n\n''Roll Call'' reported that Corwin had invested nearly $2.5 million of her own funds in the campaign as of May 13; Davis had promised to spend as much as $3 million of his own funds; and outside funds coming from both liberal and conservative groups had already \"turned the Buffalo and Rochester airwaves into a steady stream of campaign ads.\"\n\nOn election day morning, Corwin obtained a court order from a Justice of the New York Supreme Court that took effect when the polls closed. The order would impound all voting equipment, temporarily enjoin the canvas of paper ballots and bar the certification of the winner pending further court proceedings. Corwin's campaign said such orders are usual in close elections. According to ''The Buffalo News'', however, the order was likely rendered moot by Corwin's concession, also on May 24, 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorwin and her husband Philip have been married for 21 years.

A , Alesi previously served in the Monroe County Legislature and in the New York State Assembly. Following his 2012 retirement from the Senate, Alesi has served on the state's Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board and on the Public Service Commission.\n\nAlesi is notable as one of four Republican Members of the New York State Senate that voted in favor of the  in 2011.\n\n\nBefore entering office, Alesi ran a firm that operated washers and dryers in apartment complexes and colleges.\n\n\nAlesi began his political career as the Republican Deputy Town Leader for . In 1977 he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the Monroe County Legislature against . He won on his second attempt twelve years later (Ms. Slaughter had left to take a seat in the New York State Assembly and later a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.) In 1992, Alesi was elected to the , where his colleagues named him President of his class of freshman legislators. He was elected to the New York State Senate in a special election in 1996, and was re-elected every two years until his retirement in 2012.\n\nIn January 2008, Alesi illegally entered an unfinished Perinton home, claiming he believed the house was for sale, and broke his leg while climbing a ladder. The front door was locked, but Alesi managed to gain entry through an unlocked back door. He did not have permission from either the builder or the homeowners to enter the house. The owners and builder declined to press charges for trespassing. On January 18, 2011, the same day the statute of limitations for any potential trespassing charges expired, Alesi filed a lawsuit against the owners and the builder alleging an unsafe environment at the home site. After criticism from members of the public and other Republicans, Alesi withdrew the lawsuit.\n\nAlesi is known for passing a resolution commemorating the , legislative resolution J3784-2011 proclaiming 31 March 2012 as the Azerbaijani Remembrance Day and describing the March Days as the genocide \"committed by the members of Armenian Dashnak party in concert with Bolsheviks against Azerbaijanis\".\n\n\nIn 2009, Alesi voted 'no' on same-sex marriage legislation despite being considered the Republican most likely to support the legislation. He is seen on video from the New York Senate floor casting his no vote with his head in his hands, and later admitted that he struggled with his decision to vote against the legislation.\n\nIn 2011, Alesi became the first Republican to announce his support for a new same-sex marriage bill. On June 24, 2011, Alesi was one of four Republicans to vote in favor of the , stating: \"I swore with my hand on the Bible to uphold the Constitution ... I didn't swear with my hand on the Constitution to uphold the Bible\".\n\nOn May 9, 2012, Alesi announced that he would not run for re-election to the State Senate.  Alesi stated that many factors, including the welfare of the Republican Party, led to his decision. Sen. Alesi indicated that Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos had been supportive of his re-election. Prior to Sen. Alesi's announcement, Republican Assemblyman Sean Hanna had expressed interest in running a primary challenge against Sen. Alesi. On the same day that Sen. Alesi announced his decision not to run for re-election, the New York '''' reported the following:\n\nSen. James Alesi (R-Rochester) told the'''' Wednesday night that he believes his vote in favor of the landmark gay marriage legislation would have severely hampered his chances in a GOP primary this year.  He said the vote  which passed 33-29 due to the GOP defectors  cost him the support of the leadership of the local Republican and Conservative parties. They are now backing his primary opponent ... Believing that his political brand was weakened by the gay marriage vote, Alesi said he decided to step aside out of fear that a bruising primary would eventually cost the GOP his seat  and with it potentially the party's razor-thin Senate majority. His political future was also clouded, however, when he sued a couple after he broke his leg while breaking into their home, which was under construction. He wound up dropping the suit, but the political exposure from an incident in which he was trespassing was anything but favorable.\n\n\nIn 2013, Gov. Andrew Cuomo appointed Alesi to a $90,000-per-year post on the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board.\n\nOn June 19, 2017, the ''Daily News'' reported that Gov. Cuomo was \"set to nominate to the state Public Service Commission that oversees New York's utilities a former state Republican senator who helped him pass gay marriage into law into 2011.\" The ''Daily News'' identified Alesi as the potential nominee.

Both her parents are attorneys, and her father has also worked as a lobbyist. Her parents divorced in the late 1980s. Douglas Rutnik is an associate of former U.S. Senator . Gillibrand has an older brother and a younger sister. Her maternal grandparents were businessman Peter Noonan and Dorothea \"Polly\" Noonan, a founder of the Albany Democratic Women's Club and a leader of the city's Democratic . Gillibrand has , , , , and  ancestry.\n\nPolly Noonan was a longtime confidante of , the longtime . In ''Off the Sidelines'', her 2014 memoir, Gillibrand said that Corning \"was simply part of our family... He appeared at every family birthday party with the most fantastic present\". Gillibrand wrote that she did not know that the ambiguous relationship between her married grandmother and the married Corning \"was strange\" until she grew up, adding that Corning \"may have been in love with my grandmother\", but that he also loved her grandmother's entire family. According to '''', Corning, \"in effect, disinherited his wife and children\" and \"left the Noonan family his insurance business\".|group=Note}}\n\nDuring her childhood and college years, Gillibrand used the nickname \"Tina\"; she began using her birth name a few years after law school. In 1984, she graduated from , an all-women's private school in , and then enrolled at . Gillibrand majored in , studying in both Beijing and . In Beijing, she studied and lived with actress  at . Gillibrand graduated '''' in 1988. At Dartmouth, she was a member of the  sorority. During college, Gillibrand interned at Senator 's Albany office. She received her  from  and passed the bar exam in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1991, Gillibrand joined the -based law firm  as an associate. In 1992, she took a leave from Davis Polk to serve as a  to Judge  of the  in Albany.\n\nGillibrand's tenure at Davis Polk included serving as a defense attorney for tobacco company  during major , including both civil lawsuits and  criminal and civil  and  probes. As a junior associate in the mid-1990s, she defended the company's executives against a criminal investigation into whether they had committed perjury in their testimony before Congress when they claimed that they had no knowledge of a connection between tobacco smoking and cancer. Gillibrand worked closely on the case and became a key part of the defense team. As part of her work, she traveled to the company's laboratory in Germany, where she interviewed scientists about the company's alleged research into the connection. The inquiry was dropped and it was during this time that she became a senior associate.\n\nWhile working at Davis Polk, Gillibrand became involved inand later the leader ofthe Women's Leadership Forum, a program of the . Gillibrand has said that a speech to the group by  inspired her: \" was trying to encourage us to become more active in politics and she said, 'If you leave all the decision-making to others, you might not like what they do, and you will have no one but yourself to blame.' It was such a challenge to the women in the room. And it really hit me: She's talking to me.\"\n\nIn 2001, Gillibrand became a partner in the Manhattan office of . In 2002 she informed Boies of her interest in running for office and was permitted to transfer to the firm's Albany office. She left Boies in 2005 to begin her 2006 campaign for Congress.\n\n\nGillibrand has said her work at private law firms allowed her to take on '''' cases defending  and their children and tenants seeking safe housing after lead paint and unsafe conditions were found in their homes. After her time at Davis Polk, she served as Special Counsel to  (HUD)  during the last year of the . Gillibrand worked on HUD's Labor Initiative and its New Markets Initiative, on TAP's Young Leaders of the American Democracy, and on strengthening  enforcement.\n\nIn 1999, Gillibrand began working on Hillary Clinton's , focusing on campaigning to young women and encouraging them to join the effort. Many of those women later worked on Gillibrand's campaigns. She and Clinton became close during the election, with Clinton becoming something of a mentor to her. Gillibrand donated more than $12,000 to Clinton's Senate campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGillibrand considered running for office in 2004, in , against the three-term Republican incumbent . But Hillary Clinton believed circumstances would be more favorable in 2006 and advised her to wait until then. Traditionally conservative, the district and its electoral offices had been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1913, and as of November 2006, 197,473 voters in the district were registered Republicans and 82,737 were registered Democrats. Sweeney said in 2006 that \"no Republican can ever lose \". Using New York's  election laws, Gillibrand ran in 2006 on both the Democratic and  lines; in addition to having the Republican nomination, Sweeney was endorsed by the  and  parties.\n\nDuring the campaign, Gillibrand got support from other Democratic Party politicians. , a Democratic Congressman from the neighboring , campaigned for her, as did both Hillary and ; the former president appeared twice at campaign events. Both parties poured millions of dollars into the respective campaigns.\n\nMany saw Gillibrand as moderate or conservative. Michael Brendan Dougherty in '''' wrote after her victory, \"Gillibrand won her upstate New York district by running to the right: she campaigned against amnesty for illegal immigrants, promised to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington, and pledged to protect gun rights.\"\n\nGillibrand's legal representation of Philip Morris was an issue during the campaign. Her  showed that she received $23,200 in contributions from the company's employees during her 2006 campaign.\n\nThe probable turning point in the election was the November 1 release of a December 2005 police report detailing a  by Sweeney's wife, in which she claimed Sweeney was \"knocking her around the house\". The Sweeney campaign claimed the police report was false and promised to have the official report released by , but did not do so. The Sweeney campaign did release an ad in which Sweeney's wife called Gillibrand's campaign \"a disgrace\". Several months later, Sweeney's wife said her \"disgrace\" statement was coerced, and that her husband was physically abusive.\n\nBy November 5, a  showed Gillibrand ahead of Sweeney 46% to 43%. She won with 53% of the vote.\n\n\n\nAfter Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about possible 2008 candidates. Len Cutler, director of the Center for the Study of Government and Politics at Siena College, said that the seat would be difficult for Gillibrand to hold in 2008, with Republicans substantially outnumbering Democrats in the district.\n\nGillibrand was reelected in 2008 over former  , 62% to 38%. Treadwell lost despite significantly outspending Gillibrand and promising never to vote to raise taxes, not to accept a federal salary, and to limit himself to three terms in office. Campaign expenditures were the second highest in the nation for a House race. Democrats generally saw major successes during the 2008 congressional elections, credited in part to a  from .\n\nGillibrand's legal representation of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed that she received $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her work on behalf of Philip Morris, Gillibrand said that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and added that as an  at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. Davis Polk allowed associates to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.\n\n\nUpon taking office, Gillibrand joined the , a group of moderate to conservative Democrats. She was noted for voting against the , citing concerns regarding insufficient oversight and excessive . She opposed a 2007 state-level proposal to issue driver's licenses to  and voted for legislation that would withhold federal funds from immigrant . Gillibrand also voted for a bill that limited information-sharing between federal agencies about firearm purchasers and received an \"A\" rating from the  (NRA-PVF). This fell to an \"F\" rating during her time in Senate. She expressed personal support for same-sex marriage, but advocated for civil unions for same-sex couples and said same-sex marriage should a state-level issue.\n\nAfter taking office, Gillibrand became the first member of Congress to publish her official schedule, listing everyone she met with on a given day. She also published earmark requests she received and her personal financial statement. This \"Sunlight Report\", as her office termed it, was praised by in a December 2006 '''' editorial as a \"quiet touch of revolution\" in a non-transparent system. Of the earmarking process, Gillibrand said she wanted whatever was best for her district and would require every project to pass a \"greatest-need, greatest-good\" test.\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Gillibrand served on the following committees:\n* \n** \n** \n**  (Chair)\n* \n** \n** \n\n\n\nOn December 1, 2008,   announced his choice of Hillary Clinton, the  U.S. senator from New York, as . Clinton was confirmed by a vote of 94–2 on January 21, 2009. Just hours before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton resigned her Senate seat, effective immediately. Obama's December announcement began a two-month search to fill her Senate seat. Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement. A special election would then be held in November 2010 for the remainder of her term, which ended in January 2013.\n\n (2009)]]\nGovernor 's selection process began with a number of prominent names and high-profile New York Democrats, including ,  and , vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to . Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice in the days before the official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.\n\nThe response to the appointment in New York was mixed. Upstate New York media was generally optimistic about the appointment of an upstate senator, as none had been elected since  left office in 1971. Many downstaters were disappointed with the selection, with some media outlets stating that Paterson had ignored the electoral influence of New York City and downstate on state politics. One questioned whether Paterson's administration was aware of \" statewide elections are won and lost\". Gillibrand was relatively unknown statewide, and many voters found the choice surprising. One source stated, \"With every Democrat in New York ... angling for the appointment, there was a sense of bafflement, belittlement, and bruised egos when Paterson tapped the junior legislator unknown outside of Albany.\"\n\nShortly before her appointment to the Senate was announced, Gillibrand reportedly contacted the Empire State Pride Agenda, an LGBT lobbying organization in New York, to express her full support for same-sex marriage, the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy regarding gay and lesbian servicemembers, and the passage of legislation banning discrimination against transgender persons. She had supported civil unions for same-sex couples and argued that the same-sex marriage issue should be left to states. Paterson's office had advised her to reach out to Empire State Pride.\n\nGillibrand was sworn in on January 26, 2009; at 42, she entered the chamber as the youngest senator in the . In February, she endorsed , whom New York Democrats chose as their nominee for her former seat in the House of Representatives. In April, Murphy won the seat against Republican  by 399 votes and succeeded Gillibrand in the House until 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n (2011)]]\nGillibrand had numerous potential challengers in the September 14, 2010, Democratic . Some were obvious at the time of her appointment. Most notably, Representative  was unhappy with Gillibrand's stance on gun control, but McCarthy decided not to run. , a former , considered a run but decided against it in March 2009.\n\nConcerned about a possible schism in the party that could lead to a heated primary, split electorate, and weakened stance, high-ranking members of the party backed Gillibrand and requested major opponents not to run. In the end, Gillibrand faced Gail Goode, a lawyer from New York City, and won the primary with 76% of the vote.\n\nDespite what was expected to be a heated race, Gillibrand easily prevailed against former Republican congressman  in her first statewide election. By the end of October, a  poll showed Gillibrand leading 57%-34%. Gillibrand won the November election 63%–35%, carrying 54 of New York's 62 counties; the counties that supported DioGuardi did so by a margin no greater than 10%.\n\n\n\nGillibrand's special election victory gave her the right to serve the rest of Clinton's second term, which ended in January 2013. Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, she faced , an attorney running on both the Republican Party and Conservative Party lines. Gillibrand was endorsed by '''' and the ''''. She won the election with 72.2% of the vote; in so doing, she surpassed Schumer's 71.2%  and achieved the largest victory margin for a statewide candidate in New York history. She carried all counties except for two in western New York.\n\n\n\nGillibrand was reelected to a second term in the Senate, defeating Republican Chele Chiavacci Farley with 67% of the vote. During a campaign debate, she pledged that she would serve out a full six-year term if reelected. She was endorsed by the progressive groups  and .\n\n\n\n\nGillibrand is seeking a third Senate term. She faces Republican nominee Mike Sapraicone, an ex-NYPD detective and businessman.\n\n\n\nA member of the Democratic Party's relatively conservative  faction while in the House, Gillibrand has moved her political positions and ideology toward a ,  position since her appointment to the Senate. In both cases, her views were significantly defined by the respective constituencies she serveda conservative congressional district versus the generally liberal state of New York, especially as defined by New York City. For example, although she had been quiet on the U.S. military's \"\" policy when she was in the House, during her first 18 months in the Senate, Gillibrand was an important part of the successful campaign to repeal it.\n\nGillibrand made national headlines in February 2009 for stating that she and her husband kept two guns under their bed. Her staff later indicated that Gillibrand no longer stored guns under her bed.\n\nOn April 9, 2009, a combined Schumer–Gillibrand press release said that the two strongly supported a Latino being nominated to the Supreme Court at the time of the next vacancy. Their first choice was . The two introduced her at Sotomayor's  in July 2009.\n\nDuring the  of the , Gillibrand scored two substantial legislative victories: the passage of the  and the passage of the . Both were issues she had advocated for during that session. In the aftermath of these victories, Gillibrand gained a more prominent national profile.\n\nIn March 2011, Gillibrand co-sponsored the , which would restrict access to websites judged to be infringing copyrights, but ultimately announced she would not support the bill as-is due to wide critical public response.\n\nIn 2012, Gillibrand authored a portion of the , which extended limitations on  by members of Congress. A version of the bill, merged by Senator  with content from another bill authored by Senator , was passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama in April.\n\nIn 2013, Gillibrand proposed legislation that would remove  from the military chain of command; the bill was cosponsored by Senators  and . Gillibrand's bill failed to gain enough votes to break a filibuster in March 2014, but her efforts likely improved her standing as a lawmaker in the Senate.\n\nIn December 2013, Gillibrand introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would have provided paid family leave.\n\nBy 2013, Gillibrand had \"skillfully aligned herself with causes with visible, moving human characters who have helped amplified her policy goals\". For example, in campaigning for the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, she established a website with videos of gay and lesbian veterans telling their personal stories. She has been less deferential to Senate seniority protocols and more uncompromising in her positionssuch as combating sexual assault in the militarythan most freshman senators, which has sometimes caused friction with her Democratic colleagues. Senator  has contrasted her approach with other New Yorkers of both parties, saying she is distinguished by \"her determination and knowledge and willingness to sit down one on one with senators and explain what she is up to\". Her fund-raising abilityalmost $30 million from 2009 through 2013helped her become a mentor to female candidates nationwide during that period.\n\n\nIn 2014, Gillibrand was included in the annual , '''' magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nIn 2015, Gillibrand invited campus activist  to attend the . Her invitation was intended to promote the , a bill Gillibrand co-sponsored.\n\nGillibrand once supported legislation that would criminalize \"boycotts\" by individuals or groups seeking to express a disapproval of the actions taken by the government of Israel. Gillibrand's advocacy against protests and \"boycotts\" included her co-sponsoring S.720, coined the \"Israel Anti-Boycott Act\". This legislation would have criminalized any political boycott intended to protest actions by the Israeli government, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) denounced S.720, claiming its provisions seeking to \"punish U.S. persons based solely on their expressed political beliefs\" are \"inconsistent\" with First Amendment constitutional protections. In July 2017, Gillibrand stated that she no longer supported the bill in its then-current form, adding that she would advocate for changes to it. She said the bill did not \"have any relevance to individuals at all\" and insisted she planned to \"urge them to rewrite it to make sure it says...'This is only applying to companies.'\"\n\nIn a February 2018 ''60 Minutes'' profile, Gillibrand said she was \"'embarrassed and ashamed'\" of the positions on immigration and guns she held during her tenure in the House of Representatives.\n\nGillibrand was named as part of the \"Hell-No Caucus\" by '''' in 2018, along with Senators , , , and , for voting \"overwhelmingly to thwart [Trump's] nominees for administration jobs\", such as with , , and ; all the senators were considered potential 2020 presidential contenders at the time, and all five did run for president in 2020.\n\nAccording to a FiveThirtyEight study, 12% of Gillibrand's votes matched Trump's position, the lowest among all senators.\n\n\n\n* \n**  (Chair)\n** \n** \n* \n**  \n** \n**  (Chair)\n** \n* \n*\n\n\n*  (2009-2021)\n*  (2009-2011)\n\n\n* Healthy Kids Caucus\n* \n* Senate Women's Caucus\n* Sportsmen's Caucus\n* \n\n\n\n|key_people= Jess Fassler (campaign manager)\n|treasurer=\n|receipts=15919261.11\n|slogan= Brave Wins\n|homepage=\n|fec_date=September 30, 2019\n}}\n\n\nIn early 2019, on '''', Gillibrand announced the formation of an  to consider running for the  in the . During her January 15 appearance, she said, \"I am going to run\", and the same day paperwork filed with the  established the Gillibrand 2020 Exploratory Committee. Gillibrand had frequently been mentioned as a possible  contender by the media before her announcement, but during a 2018 Senate campaign debate, she had promised to serve her entire six-year term if she were reelected.\n\n\n\n State Convention in June 2019.]]\nIn a Twitter post on March 17, Gillibrand announced that she was officially running for president. Like other Democratic candidates, she pledged not to accept campaign donations from s.\n\nGillibrand was invited to the first , participating on the second night, on June 27. She was also invited to the second debate, again participating in the second night, on July 31.\n\nGillibrand suspended her campaign on August 28, 2019, citing her failure to qualify for the third round of Democratic primary debates. She neither met the polling threshold nor sustained the fundraising quota set as debate qualifications.\n\nPolitical pundits during and after her campaign noted that her role in pushing Franken to resign played a major role in her failure to garner support from donors and fellow Democrats; she doubled down on her actions on numerous occasions even after several Democrats expressed regret for calling for his resignation. Many high-profile fundraisers and donors refused to support her, saying her actions gave her the reputation that \"she would eat her own\". Other publications noted that her attempt to brand herself as \"the feminist candidate\" failed to differentiate her from her rivals.\n\n\n\nDuring her tenure in the House of Representatives, Gillibrand was known as a  Democrat. In the House, she was a member of the , a caucus of  Democrats; she also voted against the , spoke against the issuance of driver's licenses to undocumented , and voted for a bill that would withhold federal funds from immigrant . Gillibrand also voted for a bill that limited information-sharing between federal agencies about firearm purchasers and advocated for civil unions for same-sex couples.\n\nSince she became a member of the Senate, Gillibrand's political positions have moved leftward. In July 2018, '''' wrote that Gillibrand \"formerly held more conservative views on guns and immigration, but, in her nine years as New York's junior senator, [has] swung steadily to the left on those and other issues\". After being appointed to the Senate, she expressed support for same-sex marriage. A supporter of  while in the House, Gillibrand has since moved in the direction of . She has said that a conversation with a family who had lost a daughter to gun violence made her realize that she was \"wrong\" to oppose gun control measures; having once received an \"A\" rating from the NRA, she received an \"F\" rating as of 2018. In June 2018, Gillibrand called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, a \"deportation force\" and became the first sitting senator to support the call to abolish ICE. She said, \"I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works\" and \"I think you should reimagine ICE under a new agency with a very different mission\". In 2018, Gillibrand said she was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" of the positions on guns and immigration she took during her House tenure.\n\nIn May 2018, ''City & State'' reported that Gillibrand had \"moved sharply leftward on economic issues, embracing a number of proposals to expand the social safety net and bolster lower-income families\". In July 2018, ''The New York Times'' wrote that Gillibrand had \"spent recent months injecting her portfolio with a dose of the kind of economic populism that infused Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign in the 2016 presidential primary\".\n\n in 2024]]\nOn social issues, Gillibrand is generally , supporting the , , and helping to lead the successful repeal effort of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\". A supporter of  since her first House run in 2006, she co-sponsored a 2017 Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sanders and said that health care should be a right. Gillibrand also supports a federal . Although she used to be one of the top recipients of corporate campaign donations, in 2018 she supported rejecting corporate  funds and invested heavily in online fundraising. Ninety-seven percent of donations to her 2018 campaign totaled $100 or less. She advocates government transparency, being one of a few members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information.\n\nIn May 2017, Gillibrand co-sponsored the  (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and s in the occupied  if protesting actions by the Israeli government. In July 2017, Gillibrand said she no longer supported the bill in its then-current form, adding that she would advocate for changes to it. She said the bill did not \"have any relevance to individuals at all\" and insisted she planned to \"urge them to rewrite it to make sure it says...'This is only applying to companies.'\"\n\nIn 2024, Gillibrand introduced a new bill to address  in military veterans and service members.\n\n\nDeclaring a \"zero tolerance\" doctrine regarding accusations of sexual misconduct by members of Congress, Gillibrand was the first in her caucus to call on Senator  to resign. Franken left office before a  investigation could review the accuracy of the allegations against him. In 2019, seven Democratic current and former U.S. senators who had demanded Franken's resignation in 2017 told  reporter  they had been wrong to do so, but Gillibrand has expressed no regrets for leading the demand for his resignation.\nIn November 2017, amid the  movement, Gillibrand became the first high-profile Democrat to say that  should have resigned when his affair with  was revealed. In 2018, Clinton expressed disagreement with Gillibrand's opinion.\n\nIn 2019, a female former aide to Gillibrand criticized her for retaining a male staffer despite the aide's sexual harassment complaint against him.\n\n\n\n]]\n\nGillibrand met her husband, Jonathan Gillibrand, a  and , on a blind date. Jonathan planned to be in the United States for only a year while studying for his  at , but he stayed in the country because of their developing relationship. They married in a Catholic church in Manhattan in 2001.\n\nThe Gillibrands had their first son, Theodore, in 2003, and their second son, Henry, in 2008. Gillibrand continued to work until the day of Henry's delivery and received a standing ovation from her colleagues in the House for doing so.\n\nBecause of the requirements of Gillibrand's office, the family spends most of its time in Washington, D.C. In 2011, the Gillibrands sold their house in  and purchased their home in Brunswick to be closer to Gillibrand's family in Albany. In 2020, the Gillibrands sold their house in . Gillibrand stated in 2020 that her family was looking for a house in the North Country.\n\nGillibrand was inducted into , a national leadership honor society, as an ''honoris causa'' initiate at  in 2012.\n\n\nIn 2014, Gillibrand published her first book, ''Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World''. The candid memoir was notable in the media upon release due to whisperings of a future presidential run as well as Gillibrand's claims of sexism in the Senate, including specific comments made to her by other members of Congress about her weight and appearance.

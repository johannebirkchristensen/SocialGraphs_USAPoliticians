Campbell, in turn, won 75% of the vote in the 2003  to fill the vacancy on the Board of Supervisors left when Spitzer resigned to become an Assemblyman. Both men suffered criticism for their apparent job swap, which required changing Orange County from a general law county to a  county to allow an election to fill the supervisorial vacancy under the county charter instead of having then-  fill the vacancy by appointment under general law.

Indeed, Campbell was unopposed for re-election to a full four-year term on the Board of Supervisors in 2004.  In 2008, he won 80% of the vote in his bid for a second full four-year term.

In 1959, he wrote California's , which outlawed discrimination by businesses that offer services to the public and was a model for later reforms enacted nationally in the 1960s and 1970s. Unruh was Speaker of the  from 1961 to 1969 and a delegate to  from California in 1960 and 1968.\n\n\nAs a national official of the Democratic Party, he often feuded with   (1959–1967), a fellow Democrat, and was a case-study of 's treatise on machine politics, ''The Amateur Democrat''.\n\nUnruh was California campaign manager for  in 1960 and a close Kennedy associate throughout his presidency.

California pension funds were a major source of revenue for Wall Street underwriting companies, and Unruh secured campaign contributions in exchange for doing business with them. '''' said he had gained control of \"an obscure post whose duties had long emphasized bookkeeping. In characteristic fashion, he soon transformed the job into a source of financial and political power that reached from California to Wall Street.\" Because as Treasurer he was an ''ex officio'' member of many California boards and commissions, Unruh supervised \"the raising and expenditure of virtually all the state's money and consolidated his influence over billions of dollars in public investments and pension funds\".\n\nHe served as state treasurer from 1975 until his death from  on August 4, 1987, 8 months into his 4th term as treasurer.

However, he did experience overseas duty, including guarding captured Japanese soldiers during their repatriation. He returned home after the war and worked as a posting clerk, a truck driver, a hod carrier, a Fuller Brush salesman, and a gypsum miner. Later, he was employed as a photostat operator for several years. He attended , then joined an acting group called \"The Ric-y-tic Players,\" and he formed a comedy trio that included his brother Lorin.\n\n\n\nPaulsen developed a solo act, appearing as a comedic guitarist in various clubs on the West Coast and in New York City. He met the Smothers Brothers during an appearance in San Francisco. '''' premiered in 1967, and Paulsen said that he was hired because he sold them inexpensive songs and would run errands. At first, he was cast as their editorialist, but his deadpan, double-talk comments on the issues of the day propelled him into the national spotlight. His work on ''The Smothers Brothers' Comedy Hour'' earned him an Emmy Award in 1968.\n\nPaulsen made a guest appearance on '''' in the 1968 episode \"Monkees Watch Their Feet\", playing the Secretary of National Defense. He also made many appearances on ''''. In 1968, he appeared as timid Federal Agent Bosley Cranston in \"The Night of the Camera\" in Season 4 of ''''.

CBS refused to air the bit, but the incident became the impetus for the ''Smothers Brothers'' writers launching a Pat Paulsen presidential campaign. His campaign in 1968 and succeeding years was grounded in comedy, although not without serious commentary. He ran the supposed campaigns using obvious lies, double talk and tongue-in-cheek attacks on the major candidates, and he responded to all criticism with his catchphrase, \"Picky, picky, picky\". His campaign slogans included \"Just a common, ordinary, simple savior of America's destiny\", \"We’ve upped our standards, now up yours\" and \"United we sit\". He gave essentially the same answer to every question on social issues: \"To get to the meat of the matter, I will come right to the point, and take note of the fact that the heart of the issue in the final analysis escapes me.\" In announcing his candidacy on the Smothers Brothers show, Paulsen said, \"Now I ask you: Will I solve our economic problems? Will I ease the causes of racial tension? Will I bring a peaceful end to Vietnam? Sure, why not?\"\n\nPaulsen's name appeared on the ballot in  for the Democratic primary several times. In 1996, he received 921 votes (one percent) to finish second to President  (76,754 votes); this was ahead of real politicians such as Buffalo mayor . In 1992, he came in second to  in the . In the , he received 10,984 votes total.\n\n\n\nIn 1971, Paulsen and his then-wife Jane opened Pat Paulsen Vineyards, a vineyard and winemaking operation in . Shortly after  was elected mayor of  (1986), Paulsen proclaimed himself \"mayor\" of Asti, the small town near his vineyard. The office was of his own invention.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Paulsen began a relationship with social worker Linda Chaney, whom he met at a Denver comedy club. She began serving as his booking agent and the two were married in 1988. However, he learned that she was diverting his funds into her own personal accounts and he filed for divorce after only 40 days. He later sued her and was awarded a judgment of $233,000, but Chaney said that, even if she had the money, she would \"go out and shred it rather than turn it over\" to Paulsen. \n\nIn 1995, Paulsen was diagnosed with colon cancer and doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to his brain and lymph nodes in 1997. He sought alternative medicine treatment for his cancer in , Mexico and died there from complications of pneumonia and kidney failure on April 25, 1997. Paulsen was fondly remembered by fans who enjoyed his mockery of the entire electoral process. \"Whenever I’d walk around with him,\" Tom Smothers said, \"people would yell, 'Hey, Mr. President.'

He is a  who represented the , which encompassed central , including the cities of , , , and .\n\nPrior to being elected to the Assembly in 2012, Daly served as Orange County Clerk-Recorder, as well as . He first sought elected office in 1986 for the Anaheim Union High School District.\n\n\nA native of Orange County, Daly was born and raised in Anaheim. He attended four local schools, starting in kindergarten at Lincoln Elementary, then moving on to St. Anthony Claret's, Sycamore Junior High, and Anaheim High.\n\nDaly's father was a longtime Latin and English teacher at Anaheim High School.  Both his parents were active in civic affairs, providing Daly's introduction to local politics.\n\nAs a child, Daly was an All-Star player in the North Anaheim Little League.  In high school, Daly went on to play on the Anaheim High Varsity Baseball team, producing one of the leading records among Orange County pitchers.\n\nFrom his roots in Anaheim, Daly went on to receive his Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1976.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard University and returning to Anaheim, Daly served as an aide for Orange County Supervisor Ralph Clark for eight years.  A Democratic leader in a Republican-dominated county, Supervisor Clark was elected to four terms on the Orange County Board of Supervisors after serving on the Anaheim City Council and Mayor of Anaheim.\n\nDaly first sought elective office in 1986, winning election to the board of trustees of the Anaheim Union High School District. Daly went on to run for Anaheim City Council in 1988 and then he was elected mayor in 1992.\n\nDaly still lives in Anaheim. He is married and has three children.\n\n\nFrom 1992-2002, Daly served as the directly elected mayor of the City of Anaheim, the tenth largest city in California.\n\n\nIn the 1992 Mayoral election, Daly defeated then-Mayor Fred Hunter by a margin of 57% to 43%.  The decisive issue in the campaign was an unpopular citywide utility tax supported by then-Mayor Hunter, which was strongly opposed by Daly while he served as a City Councilmember.  His 1994 re-election as mayor set a record for the most votes ever received by an Anaheim mayor.\n\nIn 1998, Daly defeated a strongly backed Republican and fellow council member Bob Zemel.\n\nAs mayor, Daly supported the candidacy of Loretta Sanchez for U.S. Congress.  Daly served as an adviser to her successful upstart campaign against longtime incumbent and conservative Bob Dornan, in which Sanchez won by 984 votes.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, the Anaheim City Council took the unprecedented step of hiring a special prosecutor Ravi Mehta to investigate alleged campaign violations during the 1996 election.  Only two out of the five-member council approved the hiring after the Anaheim City Attorney refused to file charges saying the allegations against Daly and Councilmember Irv Pickler were unfounded.\n\nThe probe by Mehta, a former chair of the state Fair Political Practices Commission, led to misdemeanor complaints against Daly and Picker.  The complaints were ultimately rejected by an Orange County Municipal Judge, who also stated that the council had \"no authority [to hire] a special prosecutor, period.\"  The investigation ultimately cost the City of Anaheim more than $302,000 in legal fees.  No other city or county in California had ever hired a special prosecutor to investigate suspected campaign finance violations.  The investigation came during a time in which Daly considered running for the Orange County 4th Supervisorial District but ultimately declined to run citing personal reasons and his intent to run for reelection for mayor in 1998.\n\n\nAs mayor, Daly oversaw a billion-dollar expansion of the Anaheim Resort area, including the expansion of the Disneyland Resort with Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney as well as an expansion of the Anaheim Convention Center.  With these developments, the tourism industry grew tremendously in Anaheim, leading to more jobs and increased City revenue.  Revenue from the hotel bed tax doubled from $28.7 million in 1991-92 to $57.7 million in 2001-02.  Daly also oversaw the renovation of .

The office was left vacant by the death of Gary Granville, who had introduced a number of innovations to the department and merged the clerk's department and the recorder's office in 1995.\n\nAs the Clerk-Recorder, Daly opened branch offices in historic downtown Fullerton and Laguna Hills Civic Center, providing more access to North and South County.  He reopened the Orange County Archives as well as implemented Orange County's innovative Electronic Recording System.  He also developed a number of online based system, improving efficiency for Orange County residents.\n\nIn his 2010 countywide re-election as the Clerk-Recorder, Daly set a record with the highest countywide winning percentage in fifty years (in contested races.)\n\nDaly was named Orange County's Manager of the Year for 2010 by the . In 2011, his department was honored with a Bright Ideas in Government award for \"creative and innovative\" customer service by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.\n\n\n\nOn March 6, 2012, Daly announced his candidacy for the newly drawn 69th Assembly District to replace termed-out assemblymember Jose Solorio.\n\nIn the June 2012 primary election, Daly emerged with the highest number of votes and 39.2% of the overall vote.  Democratic challengers Santa Ana councilmember Michele Martinez and -backed candidate Julio Perez failed to garner enough votes to reach the November general election.\n\nIn the November 2012 general election, Daly beat a relatively unknown Republican challenger, Joe Moreno, by a 67.6% to 32.4% margin.\n\n\nAssemblymember Daly was sworn into the Legislature on December 3, 2012.\n\nDaly served on the following committees:\n* Chair, Insurance \n* Appropriations\n* Governmental Organization \n* Veterans Affairs \n* Transportation\n* Joint Fairs and Allocation \nIn 2013–14 he chaired the Budget Subcommittee No. 4 on State Administration.

She represented the 76th Assembly district. In November 2012 she ran in the 78th Assembly district due to redistricting, and won with 62% of the vote.\n\nIn 2012 she introduced AB 1522, a bill to prevent the granting of financial support and other spousal rights to abusive spouses. The bill was inspired by the case of a San Diego woman who was ordered to pay legal fees and spousal support to her ex-husband even though he was in prison for abusing her.\n\nIn 2012, she was the Majority Leader of the California State Assembly; in January 2014 she was chosen by the Democratic Caucus to take over as Speaker of the Assembly later in the year, replacing termed-out speaker .

The bill proposed major reforms to address the  by reducing local control (such as requiring the permitting of more apartment construction near public transit and in suburbs with high-paying jobs). Atkins refused to step in and take the bill out of committee, which was within her powers. Proponents of the bill accused Portantino of abusing his powers to deny SB50 a debate and a vote in the Senate. Atkins' action stopped legislators from bringing the bill back for consideration that year. Due to this delay, the bill could not be considered by the Senate until 2020.\n\nIn January 2020, when the bill was being reconsidered, Atkins exercised her parliamentary powers to move the bill out of Portantino's committee. The bill made it to the senate floor and was subsequently defeated after multiple floor votes.\n\n\nAtkins has faced criticism for accepting donations from fossil fuel corporations and failing to pass major climate legislation.

He graduated from  with an Associate of Arts. He also attended  for a year. His political career started in 1976, with his election to the East Nicolaus School Board. He also served northern California in the  from 1980 to 1986.\n\n\n\n\nHerger was easily reelected to Congress due to the \"safe\" Republican voter registration advantage in this district, but his election campaigns were challenged by Democratic candidates in his last campaigns. The district often fields a candidate registered with a third party, such as the Libertarian party and, during the 1990s, the Natural Law Party.\n\nIn 2002 and 2004, Herger defeated Democrat Mike Johnson, garnering 67% of the vote in 2004. In 2006, Herger faced Arjinderpal Sekhon and received 64% of the vote. In 2008, Herger faced Trinity County Supervisor Jeff Morris, who did somewhat better, holding Herger to 57% of the vote.\n\nIn 2010, Herger faced a Republican primary challenge from retired Colonel Pete Stiglich, and ran in the general against Democrat Jim Reed, a lawyer who divides his time between the Bay Area and Fall River. Herger prevailed with 57% of the vote.\n\n\n\nHerger served on the influential  since his tenure began as a federal representative. Within Ways and Means, Representative Herger served on two subcommittees, the , and the . In the 110th Congress he was named the Ranking Member of the Republican (minority) delegation to the Trade Subcommittee. Representative Herger's participation in full committee is limited to Ways and Means, in accordance with the rules of the Committee on Ways and Means. While he chaired the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support (called the Subcommittee on Human Resources during his watch) beginning with the , he played a leading role in the reauthorization and expansion of the 1996 welfare reform law. He sponsored the , passed as part of the larger 1996 Welfare Reform Law. This bill gave additional financial incentives to law enforcement agencies that identified fraudulent recipients of aid.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, Herger triggered controversy when he attended a town hall meeting in Redding, California, where an audience member introduced himself as a \"proud right-wing \"  to reporters in a private interview ten days later, after the controversy had reached national attention, that he had misspoken, having intended to say \"extremist\". Herger did not immediately distance himself from the remark then and there, but, instead, after the constituent's lengthy comment, responded by saying, \"Amen. God bless you. There goes a great American.\" Many people, both inside and outside Herger's congressional district found his failure to respond immediately unacceptable.

Herger supported legislation to bolster free and fair trade in an effort to support his constituency.

The act aims to reduce vegetation density in Forest Service lands, while expanding forest biodiversity (i.e. reduction of \"monoculture\" forests).\n\nCongressmen Herger and Meek (D-FL) drafted a bill to repeal the three percent withholding tax scheduled to begin in 2011. The withholding tax would apply to governments with expenditures of greater than US$100&nbsp;million on services from for-profit companies. The law mandates that governments will only deliver 97&nbsp;percent of a contract to the contractor, and send the remaining  3% to the .

He attended  but did not graduate. He moved to  and attended , then became an intern for U.S. Representative , after which he worked with  in the Los Angeles Conservation Corps. He was a field representative for the .\n\nIn 2004, Ludlow married Kimberly Roxanne Blake in a private ceremony performed by her father, Bishop , pastor of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ. They have one child of their own, Martin Jr., and are parents of five others.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Ludlow became chief of staff to state Assembly Member , and in 2001 he was named political director of the  under the executive secretary, . In 2002 he became a member of the staff of Assembly member .\n\nWith the backing of  he won election to the City Council in May 2003 in a runoff election over Deron Williams by a 56-44 ratio. He was also endorsed by the  \"and other business groups.\" He was sworn in for a term beginning July 1 by his mother, Anne, and Ethel Bradley, the widow of former Mayor , in a public ceremony dedicated to Willis Ludlow.\n\nDuring his time at the City Council, Ludlow worked to reduce gang violence in L.A., proposing the creation of a city department dedicated to gang intervention and prevention. During the summer of 2003, his district established a six-week program called \"Summer of Success\", which provided activities such as video games, soccer clinics, midnight basketball and dance classes in Baldwin Village, also known as \"The Jungle\". The Summer of Success series was successful in reducing gang violence and was later implemented by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in what was called \"Summer Night Lights\". Ludlow also became the head of the city's Convention, Tourism, Entertainment Industry and Business Enterprise Committee, created with the goal of \"finding ways\" to \"make sure the film industry stays in Los Angeles.\"\n\nLudlow was appointed by Mayor  to the  board, and in early 2004 it became known that he was the subject of an investigation into his relations with a firm that proposed to build a West Los Angeles transportation yard for a fleet of buses. No charges were filed.\n\nIn June 2005, Ludlow was appointed interim secretary-treasurer, the chief official, of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, as of July 1, and stated he would quit the City Council on June 30. He won the job permanently at a union election in June and proceeded to successfully fight the plans of Governor  to limit the ability of public employee unions to collect political money from their members.\n\nIn February 2006, he announced that he would resign as a result of the criminal investigations into the financing of his City Council campaign, and news surfaced that a  was being arranged. Ludlow said he would cooperate with federal, state and city investigators that claimed that the  Local 99 illegally funneled $53,000 from labor union accounts into his 2003 race. He said in a statement:\n\nIt has been my joy, my honor, and my privilege to be a part of the most dynamic labor movement anywhere in the United States of America. However, as a result of errors in my judgment, I must take these steps to begin to accept full responsibility for the mistakes that I made.\"\n\n\n and School Board member  in 2023.]]\nIn April 2006, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Horwitz sentenced Ludlow to three years'  and $45,000 in fines and costs for conspiring to illegally divert school employees' union funds to his 2003 election campaign. Ludlow was banned from holding elected office for four years. In June of that year, federal Judge  sentenced him to five years' probation and 2,000 hours of community service and ordered Ludlow to return $36,400 to the school employees' union. Ludlow was barred from serving in leadership position with any union for thirteen years. Ludlow had earlier been fined $105,000 by the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission for violating city campaign laws.\n\nLudlow's financial problems have resulted in a \"warm embrace\" by Los Angeles civic leaders, a ''Los Angeles Times'' article reported, including at least one fund-raiser dinner and other kinds of help.\n\n\"Why do I support him? L.A. needs him,\" said attorney Connie Rice, who was among 16 people, including actor  and Rep.  (D-Los Angeles), who were part of the \"reception committee\" at a recent fundraiser to benefit Ludlow. \"The reason he's important is that he bridges every L.A. divide there is  whether it be racial, class, city, immigration. He is genuinely loved in every community.\"\n\nIn a critical editorial, though, the ''Times'' said that the fundraiser amounted to \"a collective smirk to the people of Los Angeles,\" and the '''' editorialized, \"Astonishingly, Ludlow has gotten nothing but sympathy from the city's elite, as if he were the victim of wrongdoing and not a criminal.\"\n\nIn June 2008, ''Times'' columnist Kurt Streeter wrote that Ludlow had found \"full redemption\" through his volunteer work at  as a volunteer coaching assistant \"working to keep kids on the straight path with his buzz saw energy, boundless optimism and a humility forged by the crucible of public humiliation.\"\n\nIn 2012, , a member of the UCLA football team, cited Ludlow as his mentor, and the reason why he became interested in politics and public policy. He said, \"The former Los Angeles City Councilman Martin Ludlow  he helped out at Dorsey and he became my mentor. I understood the things he did around the community and the impact that made.\"\n\nLudlow has volunteered as a strength and conditioning coach for kids in  and created a charity called Dorsey Football Boosters. His work as a coach and mentor was profiled in a June 22, 2008, '''' feature titled \".\n\n\n\nLudlow founded live events-production company Bridge Street, Inc. in 2012. Bridge Street organizes concerts, rallies, festivals, and ceremonies that promote social-justice themes such as civil rights, advocacy for the poor, prison re-entry, and gang prevention.\n \nIn 2013, Ludlow and Bridge Street associate-produced the BET Experience concert series, and would go on to do so for the next several years. In 2018, Bridge Street produced the 50th Anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s “Mountaintop Speech” in Memphis, TN, along with several associated events. In 2019, Bridge Street produced ObamaFest 2019, celebrating the renaming of Los Angeles's Rodeo Road to “Obama Boulevard.”\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Despite the controversy, Richardson defeated   and 9 other Democrats in the June 26  to win her party's nomination, the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. On August 21, Richardson won more than 65% of the vote in a four-way race against the nominees of the , , and .  She easily won a full term in 2008, and was reelected in 2010, in both cases against only nominal Republican opposition\n\nRedistricting for the 2012 elections significantly altered California's congressional map.  Richardson had previously represented portions of inland Los Angeles and inland Long Beach, all of ,  and , as well as parts of other municipalities.  However, her old district was split almost in half, with the bulk of her territory becoming the 44th District.  While Richardson's home in Long Beach was drawn into the new , she moved her residence into the 44th district because its demographics were more similar to the old 37th; like the 44th, it is majority black and Latino.  Fellow Democrat , who had previously represented the neighboring , had her home drawn into the 44th as well. The  endorsed Hahn for the seat. In the all-party primary, Hahn defeated Richardson with 60 percent of the vote to Richardson's 39 percentwhich was all the more remarkable since, on paper, the district's demographics were more favorable to Richardson.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Hahn easily beat Richardson by 20 percentage points.\n\n\nRichardson was accused of receiving preferential treatment by a bank when it rescinded an erroneous foreclosure of her house, but was cleared of wrongdoing by the , in accordance with the recommendations of the .

The bank then rescinded the foreclosure, causing the controversy.\n\nAfter her election to the California Assembly, Richardson purchased a home in Sacramento with no money down and a .  According to county records, Richardson received a default notice and Notice of Trustee's Sale in late 2007.  In December 2007, Richardson was behind in payments by more than $18,000.  According to the couple that sold the home to Richardson, Richardson was not maintaining the home. Sharon Helmar has stated: \"The neighbors are extremely unhappy with her. She didn't mow the lawn or take out the garbage while she was there. We lived there for a long time, 30 years, and we had to hide our heads whenever we came back to the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe real estate broker who bought Richardson's Sacramento house at the foreclosure sale accused her of receiving preferential treatment because her lender had issued a notice to rescind the sale. James York, owner of Red Rock Mortgage, said he would file a lawsuit against Richardson and her lender, Washington Mutual, but settled out of court with the terms not disclosed.  Richardson had not been making payments on the property for nearly a year, and had also gone into default on her two other houses in Long Beach and San Pedro. Richardson, D-Long Beach, has said that the auction should never have been held, because she had worked out a loan modification agreement with her lender beforehand and had begun making payments.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee, following the recommendations of the Ethics Office, found no wrongdoing other than by Richardson's Mortgage Broker, who was referred to the Justice Department for , which was widespread at the time the mortgage was made. Mistaken foreclosures despite paid-up recovery agreements, such as the one that happened to Richardson, were also becoming rampant during this period.\n\nRichardson also initially did not disclose a loan from a strip club owner when on the City Council, public records show.\n\nRichardson was speaker of the House pro tempore during the November 29, 2010 lame-duck session of Congress.  She initially refused to recognize, then relented to allow committee ranking member Steve Buyer to talk despite the failure of the committee chairman to appear. She was seen discussing with the House parliamentarian and aides how to handle the failure of the committee chairman to appear to present his bill under  that minorities in both parties have often denounced when out of power in the House, as Boyer did when recognized in this instance.\n\nOn November 3, 2011, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Richardson would face an ethics inquiry related to possible illegal use of staffers.\n\nOn November 4, 2011, Richardson claimed that the House Ethics Committee, composed of five members from the Democratic Party and five members from Republican Party, singled her out for investigation because she is African-American. The Ethics Committee leaders did announce that the vote to establish a four-member investigative subcommittee was unanimous.\n\n\nOn August 1, 2012, the House Ethics Committee issued its report about accusations of improper use of staff. It found that Richardson had broken federal law, violated House rules and obstructed the Committee's own investigation. She was found guilty on seven counts of violating House rules by improperly pressuring her staff to campaign for her, destroying evidence and tampering with witness testimony. Richardson was ordered to pay a fine of $10,000 within four months and promised to require staffers who work on her campaign to sign a waiver stating that they haven't been pressured to do so.

He returned to Mexico, married, and years later returned with his wife and children to the United States in the 1950s, settling in Texas. This was the beginning of his experience as a farmworker over a 15-year period of fieldwork that included many migratory moves between the states of California and Texas, working in cotton and orange fields and whatever else was in season. Later, when Simón and his family picked up contract labor work, he picked strawberries in the central coast region of California at the age of 9. Due to the seasonal farmwork they followed, Simón moved constantly and never fully settled for long periods of time in one place. For his parents, this pattern continued until their retirement in 1985.\n\n\nSimon Salinas finally settled permanently in the city of , at the age of 18, so that he could focus on his education.

Kaplan received national media attention from this initiative, appearing on PBS's '''' and  to discuss it.

Oakland Mayor  stated, \"Our city and county governments should work with each other, not against each other.

The alternative would have been for the City Council to appoint a successor for the remaining term of some years. Russell won the special vote on December 3, 1969, by 620 votes over Frank Small, who had been Timberlake's chief deputy for 16 years. There were three other candidates.

While in the Assembly he served as Chairman of the Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee. Instead of seeking a third term in 1994, Umberg ran for  but lost to   in the .\n\n\nUmberg then joined the law firm of  in 1995 as a partner. He was the Managing Partner of Morrison & Foerster's Orange County Office from 2003 until 2005.  During the , he served as the chairman of the  re-election campaign in California. Clinton appointed Umberg as the Deputy Director of the  in 1997.\n\n\nIn 2000, Umberg left the Clinton administration and returned to California. In 2002, he lost the Democratic Party nomination for  to . In 2004, Umberg won election to the Assembly to represent the 69th District. During his third term, Umberg chaired the Elections and Redistriciting Committee. While in the legislature, Umberg authored over 60 measures which became law. These laws include measures dealing with hate crimes, white collar crime, campaign finance reform, high-speed rail transport and school meal programs.\n\n\nUmberg sought the seat of retiring   (D) in the 2006 elections. Orange County  and former Assemblyman  jumped in the race in January 2006 despite pressure from the local Democratic party for him to stay out (although with pressure from the state Democratic party for him to jump in), stating that he was running in part because of the allegations about Umberg's residency. Aside from other negative articles, Umberg also received criticism that he voted to legalize . Umberg attempted to get Correa off the ballot because Correa submitted more than the number of signatures required to qualify for the ballot, but ultimately failed. Umberg also claimed that an alliance between Correa and State Senate President Pro Tem  to funnel funds to Correa's campaign was illegal. Umberg was defeated by Correa by a 60% to 40% margin, and Correa went on to narrowly win the general election.\n\n\nAfter Correa won the general election for the state Senate by a 1% margin, Umberg entered the race to replace Correa on the , representing the 1st Supervisorial District. 52% of 1st Supervisorial District voters are also voters in the 69th Assembly District, formerly represented by Umberg. 73% of 1st Supervisorial District voters are also 34th Senate District voters, so Umberg was believed to be the favorite. On 6 February 2007, Umberg received 21.4%, coming in third, far less than he had been expected to poll.

She is a  who represented the , which encompassed parts of southeastern , including her home city of . She had served in the Assembly since 2012.\n\nWhile Garcia had been involved in politics in high school, where she organized opposition to , after college she became a teacher. In the late 2000s, tired of what seemed to her to be inaction by the Bell Gardens city council, she began attending its meetings and questioning its members. A bid to get elected to council herself failed, but a friend who lived in neighboring  asked her if she could attend that city's council meetings and help her figure out why its property taxes were so high. The investigations they did led to  in which several city officials were found to have enriched themselves at public expense, and were imprisoned.\n\nIn 2012, Garcia defeated , a former assemblyman, in the primary and went on to defeat her  opponent in the general election for the 58th District seat. She was re-elected in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020. In December 2021, Garcia announced she was running in the primary for the newly created 42nd Congressional District that will stretch from Long Beach to Downtown Los Angeles, she lost the June 7 primary finishing in third place.\n\n\nGarcia was raised in , one of a number of largely Latino working-class suburbs in Southeast Los Angeles County. Her parents, who were from Mexico, divorced when Garcia's mother was pregnant with her. Her mother worked making clothes in a sweatshop, raising her four children in a one bedroom apartment. Later, Garcia's mother started her own clothing manufacturing business and remarried. Investments in other businesses and properties followed, and though they were upwardly mobile, the family stayed in Bell Gardens.\n\n\nWhile still in high school, Garcia and a friend organized opposition to , a statewide ballot measure championed by then-governor  that sought to establish a state-run citizenship screening system and prohibit undocumented residents from receiving non-emergency health care, public education and other services in California. Although Prop 187 passed in November 1994, it was later found unconstitutional and never implemented.\n\n\nGrowing up, Garcia was a self-described math nerd. She went to , where she studied both math and politics. She spent her junior year studying in  as the , after years of  rule, took its first steps toward democracy in the wake of the . Later, she earned a teaching credential and a  from , and is a doctoral candidate in public administration at .\n\n\nAfter graduation, Cristina taught math and statistics for 12 years, first in a Los Angeles public high school, then at , and at USC where she taught statistics.\n\n\nAfter her mother suffered a heart attack in 2009, the thirty year-old Garcia moved back to  to help care for her parents (her stepfather was already struggling with diabetes). She has admitted to being frustrated with the move because, like many ambitious young people from the area, she had felt success meant \"leaving and never coming back.\"\n\n\nShe complained regularly about the city's lack of services and economic development, until she took her sister's advice to stop griping and do something about it. She became a regular at City Council meetings, turning into an agitator and a gadfly. She studied budgets, learned how to make Public Records Act requests, tracked the compensation city officials received, and demanded fiscal responsibility.\n\nIn 2009, Garcia ran for Bell Gardens city council, but fell 114 votes short of getting one of the three open seats.\n\n\nAt about the same time, activists in the neighboring city of  were growing concerned about rising local property taxes, and what their money was going toward. One of them asked Garcia for help, and she started digging into Bell's finances. '''' reporter Jeff Gottlieb said Garcia was one of the first people he interviewed about corruption in Bell \"Talking to Cristina and others, you got a feeling that there was something wrong in Bell\".\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 15, 2010, the ''Los Angeles Times'' broke its first story on the corruption in Bell. Headlined \"Is A City Manager Worth $800,000?\" it detailed the exorbitant salaries  and other Bell city officials were paid. (For their coverage of the corruption in Bell, ''Times'' reporters Jeff Gottlieb and Ruben Vives were awarded the 2011  for Public Service.)\n\nThat night, Garcia and local businessman Ali Salehwith Dale Walker and Denise Rodarte joining the next day founded a group that would come to be called BASTAan acronym for the Bell Association to Stop the Abuse, and in Spanish, ENOUGH!\n\nGarcia became the chief spokesperson for the grassroots movement that, according to BASTA political consultant Leo Briones, did 60 press releases in a year. In a city where the electorate was known for apathy, the group drew hundreds of residents to town hall meetings, covered the city with overnight flyer blitzes, staged rallies and flooded council meetings with thousands of angry residents.\n\n\nAfter the mayor and targeted council members refused to step down, BASTA organized a recall effort in August 2010 and started collecting signatures to put the measure before the voters. In March 2011, the effort succeeded in ousting Mayor  and council members , , as well as Luis Artiga, who had resigned but remained on the ballot.\n\n\nOn April 16, 2014, former city administrator Robert Rizzo was sentenced to 12 years in state prison and ordered to pay $8.8 million in restitution to the city of Bellin addition to the 33 month federal prison sentence he had already received for tax fraud. In all, seven officials received sentences and fines, including an 11 years and eight months prison sentence for Rizzo's assistant city manager, Angela Spaccia.\n\n\nIn 2012, Cristina won a seat in the California Assembly with an upset victory over former Assemblyman  in the Democratic Primary, and garnered 71.5% of the vote despite being outspent by a margin of 7 to 1 against her Republican opponent.\n\n\nIn 2013, Garcia was the first member of the California Legislature to call for then State Senator  to resign from office after an unsealed FBI affidavit and subsequent news reports surfaced of possible corruption. Calderon was the most powerful member of a political dynasty for decades in California that included his brothers, former state assembly members Tom Calderon and , and his nephew, current state Assemblyman .\n\nIn October 2016, Ron Calderon was sentenced to 42 months and admitted in a plea deal of accepting tens of thousands of dollars from undercover  agents and a hospital executive. Tom Calderon was sentenced to a year in federal custody for  bribes taken by his brother.\n\nA judge's recommendation in August 2017 that Ron Calderon be considered for early release drew outrage from Garcia who said, \"Granting his request&nbsp;... after only serving seven months in a white-collar facilityis an added insult to my community and a void of justice in our democracy.\"\n\n\nIn 2017, Garcia became recognized as a strong voice in the #MeToo movement. In an interview with '''', Garcia revealed that she had been repeatedly sexually harassed by men during her legislative career, and later co-signed a letter calling for an end to workplace harassment of women. She has also said that some members of the  are not attentive during sexual harassment training that is conducted by legislative staff.  She was one of a number of people whose pictures were featured in '''' magazine's 2017  issue honoring what it called \"The Silence Breakers\"women (and men) who had broken their silence about experiences of sexual harassment.\n\nIn January 2018, Daniel Fierro, a former staff member for Assemblyman  and current head of Presidio Strategic Communications (formerly Fierro Public Affairs), a public relations and public policy consulting firm that lists Calderon as a client, claimed an intoxicated Garcia had once groped him against his will following the Assembly's annual softball game in 2014. Assembly Speaker  removed Garcia from all her committee assignments, one of which, the Natural Resources Committee, she chaired. In November 2018, Rendon notified Garcia the second investigation found that a preponderance of evidence supported a finding that Garcia had encountered Fierro in an overly familiar way that she would not have if she were sober, but did not support his claim that the encounter was sexual in nature. It found her behavior violated the California Assembly's Policy Against Sexual Harassment.\n\nAn unnamed lobbyist also accused Garcia of sexual harassing him at a Sacramento political fundraiser in March 2017 while she was intoxicated, alleging that she had made inappropriate sexual proposals and attempted to grope him.\n\n\n\nAs of January 2019, Garcia's committee assignments for the 2019-2020 legislative session, include Budget; Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials; Natural Resources; and Utilities and Energy.\n\nFor the 2021-2022 session, Garcia was named chair of the Budget Subcommittee No. 5 on Public Safety and co-chair of the select committee for Corporate Board and California Workforce Diversity. Garcia's membership assignments on standing committees include Banking and Finance; Budget; Budget Committee No. 6 on Budget Process, Oversight and Program Evaluation; Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials; Natural Resources; Utilities and Energy; Water, Parks, and Wildlife. Garcia was one of eight assembly members named to the Joint legislative Budget Committee.\n\nIn December 2020, Cristina Garcia was elected to again lead the bipartisan California Legislative Women's Caucus, made up of members of both the California Senate and Assembly, a body she had chaired up until the spring of 2018.\n\n\n\nOn December 23, 2021, Cristina Garcia announced that she will run for the newly created 42nd District seat to join California's Congressional delegation in the U.S. Congress. The new district combines portions of two previous districts to create a majority Latino district that includes a swath of Long Beach along with areas Garcia currently represents in the California Assembly that include Bell and Downey. She lost the June 7 primary finishing in third behind educator John Briscoe and  Mayor  (no relation), who went on to win the general election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 5, 2018, Garcia finished first in the race for the 58th California Assembly seat in California's  election.

He came in second place in  for .\n\nPerata worked with Governor  to gain passage of five infrastructure related bond measures in 2006.  Prior to serving in the State Senate, Perata served in the , as a member of the  of , and as a high school teacher.\n\n\nBorn in , Perata is the son of Italian immigrants.  During his childhood, he helped his father, Dick, to deliver milk door-to-door for the Lakehurst Creamery in Alameda.   Perata graduated from Saint Joseph High School and earned his degree from . He taught English, , and  from 1966 to 1981 in  schools.  Perata has a daughter and a son.\n\n\nPerata began his political career when he ran for Mayor of  in 1975 but was narrowly defeated.  In 1986 he was elected to the  Board of Supervisors and was re-elected to a second term. As Supervisor, Perata worked to shut down problematic liquor stores,  ban cigarette advertising, and lobbied the state legislature for an  and funding for the mentally ill.\n\n\nHaving served eight years representing Oakland as an Alameda County Supervisor, Perata's first attempt at state politics came in the 1994 democratic primary for controller, aged 49. He was unsuccessful, capturing 27.27% of the vote. Afterwards, Perata served as a staff assistant for then Senate Pro Tem . In 1996, Perata was elected as a man for the Oakland, Alameda, and Piedmont district.\n\nIn 1998, Perata ran for the State Senate for the 9th District which currently includes , , , , , , , , , , , and .\n\nPerata's run (and election) to the State Senate in 1998 was part of a series of five special elections that were held in the East Bay within less than 12 months, as Perata and other East Bay politicians vied for different political offices.  For a detailed account of events, see .\n\nDon Perata was selected by his peers in the  to lead the party in the California State Senate in 2004, becoming the California State Senate President Pro Tempore and leader of Senate. The position is the highest-ranking leader and most powerful member of the Senate.\nThe state Democratic Party re-elected Perata as President pro Tem until his retirement from the State Senate in 2008.\n\n\n\n\nPerata is a staunch advocate of . In 1999, Perata successfully drove legislation that updated the California \"assault weapons\" ban by adding a ban of generically described s. He obtained a  to legally carry a loaded handgun in public. He claimed this was necessary for  due to threats on his life and the well-being of his family from some individual opponents of his pro- legislative activity.\n\nPerata has been an advocate for the rights of the elderly, the mentally ill, and the disabled.  He supported legislation to create a discount drug program and legislation to require HMOs to pay for mental health treatment. He supported legislation that secured $27 million annually for ovarian and prostate cancer and legislation that increase access to breast cancer screening for low-income women. He has authored legislation requiring California utilities companies to contract for cleaner energy sources and supported tougher penalties on oil refinery emissions.\n\nIn early 2005, Perata introduced a bill to repair California's flagging infrastructure including highway improvements, housing reform and levee repairs. Governor  began to speak out in favor of improving state infrastructure after Schawarzenegger's November 2005 special election ballot initiatives were defeated. While Schwarzenegger's plan included fixing transportation problems, his infrastructure plan was drastically more costly and advocated more prisons and did not address the housing problem.\n\nIn a rare occurrence for Sacramento politicians, in early 2006 Perata and Schwarzenegger began to work together to piece together a bipartisan infrastructure plan that both sides of the legislature could embrace. They were successful and five bond measures were approved by California voters on the November 2006 ballot.  These measures are aimed at improving roads, mass transit, affordable housing, levee repair, and upgrading educational facilities.\n\nIn July 2007, during state budget negotiations, Perata ordered the Senate to remain in session for 19 hours in an attempt to reach an agreement on the budget. California requires two-thirds of both legislative houses and the governor's signature to pass a budget.  Perata needed two Republican votes in the State Senate to pass the budget and the lock down aimed to get those two Republican votes. The California State Senate Republicans presented a revised budget that aimed to reduce state spending and included tax credits to some Fortune 500 corporations, cuts to transportation and welfare, and eliminating cost-of-living pay raises to the blind, elderly, and disabled.\n\nThe state budget had already gained the required two-thirds majority in the California Assembly and the support of Governor Schwarzenegger. Perata and the Senate Democrats rejected the Senate Republican budget proposal and the Republicans held out for weeks into August, preventing many state legislators from returning home for their summer recess, before the budget was passed. Perata retaliated against   for voting against the budget by stripping Denham of committee assignments and contributing to a recall effort against Denham.\n\nPerata's concluded about the Capitol: \"There is no center. I'm not talking about political center. There is no action center, or moral center, or anything else left in Sacramento.\"\n\nIn an April interview, Perata reflected on the value of the legislation passed by the State Legislature under his leadership as : \"Almost everything I wanted to do in Sacramento that was beneficial to the statewhether it was on gun control or infant mortalitywas twice as beneficial to my district. In many instances, my role was to get it done; I didn't have the need to take or get the credit, just results.\"\n\n\n, a term limit alteration ballot measure sponsored by Perata and  , did not pass in February 2008. Perata termed out of the State Senate (and Núñez termed out of the State Assembly) in 2008.  The proposition would have allowed Perata to serve one more term in the State Senate (and Núñez three more terms in the State Assembly). Perata was a target for criticism by the opposition to Proposition 93. One television ad included the following line: \"Don Perata, whose home was raided by the FBI in the ongoing corruption probe.\", Knbc.com, January 24, 2008.\n\nPerata filed a \"statement of intention\" to run for the  in 2010, but instead decided to run for  after incumbent  declined to run for re-election.\n\nIn the November 2010 election, Perata ran for Mayor in a field of nine candidates. The two other major contenders were City Council members  and . He led in , but came in second place following winner Quan after taking into account  (instant runoff).\n\nPerata was also the co-chair of a California campaign committee to pass the , 2012's Proposition 29 a ballot measure that was defeated by California voters on June 5, 2012. If it would have passed, the measure was projected to generate over $500 million annually for cancer research by levying a new $1-per-pack tax on tobacco products in California. Revenues would have also been spent on smoking-cessation programs, and tobacco law-enforcement.\n\n\nIn early 2004, the '''' reported that Perata's friend and associate, Timothy G. Staples, had received $313,000 in business from political campaigns initiated or supported by Perata. At the same time, Staples had paid Perata $100,000 per year in consulting fees that supplement Perata's Senate salary, according to financial records and interviews with the senator. After this disclosure The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights sent a letter to the Senate stating that Perata's payments for consulting work looked \"like a complex and illegal money-laundering mechanism.\"\n\nThat same week the Senate Ethics Committee began an investigation into the matter, but dropped it the following month concluding that the dealings did not violate the Senate's standards of conduct or conflict-of-interest rules. Later that same month the ''Chronicle'' reported on another dealing by the Senator. Since 1999, Perata's campaign fund and various other political committees had paid Exit Strategies more than $743,000, according to campaign finance documents. Exit Strategies, a political direct mail firm, was launched in 1999 by Perata's son, Nick, and based at his father's Alameda County home. By their own accounting, Exit Strategies paid the senator nearly $138,000 during the same period for rent and consulting fees. The Senate Ethics Committee again ruled that this was not an actionable violation, but it raised questions into the propriety of the relationship.\n\nAdditional stories by ''The Chronicle'' during this time insinuated that Perata had carried a bill on behalf of Mercury Insurance, which may have allowed the company to circumvent . Mercury, in turn, donated $50,000 to a political committee run by Oakland developer Phil Tagami, who later hired Staples, who had previously paid Perata as a consultant.\n\nIn early November 2004, Perata became the official target of a probe by the Justice Department under Republican President, George W. Bush. The FBI, the US Attorney's Office, and a federal grand jury investigated whether Perata took bribes or kickbacks from friends and campaign donors in exchange for his help.\n\nThat same year, Perata was also criticized when he described as \"crackers\" - a disparaging slang term for poor Southern whites - some San Diego-area residents who stridently opposed a bill to give illegal immigrants the ability to obtain driver's licenses.\n\nIn May 2007, the East Bay Express, an  weekly in the , published a two-part investigation of Perata. The articles suggested that between 1998 and 2007, Perata spent more than $1 million of campaign cash on parties and high-end lifestyle expenditures, amounting to more than one-quarter of the total he raised for his reelection campaigns in that time. The same free publication also alleged that Perata had manipulated  causes, such as antiwar sentiment, for his own political ends. and had used campaign donations to support his lavish lifestyle.\n\nThe  investigation lasted five years. No arrests or indictments occurred, and in early 2009, Justice Department officials closed the case and announced they would not be filing any charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n* \n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A native of , he grew up in , where he served as mayor from 1953 through 1956.\n\n\nFred Lawrence Peterson was born on May 21, 1896, in , to Frank R. Peterson and Nina A. Peterson. Peterson lived in Portland from 1902, and graduated from  in 1915. His father Frank operated the Lents pharmacy for a number of years.  Fred served as a sergeant in the  during World War I and was later promoted to second lieutenant.\n\n\nIn 1940, Peterson was a prominent Portland east-side businessman when he began his run for political office.  At that time, he was pharmacist and proprietor of the Glisan Street Pharmacy.  It was Peterson's contention, as stated at the Willamette Democratic Society luncheon on April 18, 1940, that \"…city hall is a place for business men and a business administration\" (''Oregonian'', April 19, 1940 p.&nbsp;7).  His unsuccessful first campaign for city commissioner in 1940 called on Portland citizens to clean up the city for children, building more parks and playgrounds.  His second campaign for city commissioner, also in 1940, was successful, and he took office on January 1, 1941.  As commissioner he presided over the Bureau of Health.  He continued to serve as a city commissioner until elected as mayor.\n\nPeterson served three terms as city commissioner.  During his later service as commissioner, he battled with Mayor , Portland's first female mayor.  Ironically, he had encouraged her to run for office.  Lee was a reform-minded Republican who devoted attention to removing slot machines from American Legion, Eagles, and Shriner's facilities and even the prestigious , all of which Peterson as commissioner and member of the business community opposed.  Her attempt to have gambling s removed from shops was also opposed by Peterson.  She responded by removing Peterson as commissioner of finance and made him commissioner of public utilities, pointedly adding garbage collection and street sweeping to his new duties.  The two fought for the mayoralty in a close election that Peterson won in November 1952.\n\n\n\nPeterson served as mayor from January 1, 1953, to December 31, 1956. In 1955, when the new chief engineer of the Water Bureau L. Kenneth Anderson told him a new dam was needed in the  immediately, Peterson told him to get it done now.  Anderson replied that a great deal of planning and design would be required, to which Peterson said, \"Put the dam in this summer and then you can plan and design it next winter during the slow period\".\n\nAmong the events of his administration was a visit by the 's newly acquired elephant Rosy to City Hall on September 26, 1953.  On June 11, 1955, Peterson rode in a car in the  Parade with ex-president .\n\n\n\nPeterson was a member of the , , the , the Portland chapter of , and the Portland Breakfast Club.\n\nPeterson was married to Madeline E. (born July 28, 1898, and died June 8, 1964) until her death, and later to Margaruite \"Peg\". Peterson died of cancer at age 89 on October 16, 1985.

Elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012, Johnson is the  to serve as mayor of . Before entering politics, Johnson was a professional  player in the  (NBA).\n\nAfter a stint with the   during a portion of his rookie year, the  played as a member of the  for the remainder of his NBA career.\n\nDuring his 12-year playing career, Johnson was a three-time  as well as four-time second team  selection and held numerous records for the Phoenix Suns organization. At the , Johnson was named a two-time  player and an honorable-mention  by the .\n\nJohnson holds a  in  from U.C. Berkeley that he completed after his initial retirement from the NBA. Since founding St. HOPE in 1989, Johnson has been active in education reform. As Mayor of Sacramento, Johnson launched two education initiatives: Stand UP and Sacramento READS!, to benefit students in Sacramento. Johnson also helped to deter the  basketball team from moving to Anaheim, and, later, to Seattle, Washington.\n\n\nJohnson, the son of Georgia West and Lawrence Johnson, was born March 4, 1966, in Sacramento. After his father died in a boating accident when he was three, Johnson was raised by his grandparents, the Peat family. He attended , where he starred in both baseball and basketball. In his senior year, Johnson led the state of California in scoring (32.5 ppg) and was named the Northern California Player of the Year.\n\n\n\n\nJohnson accepted a scholarship to play basketball for the . As a four-year starter, Johnson ended his college career in 1987 as the school's all-time leader in assists (since eclipsed by ), steals, and scoring (since eclipsed by , , ,  and ). Johnson was named to the  First Team in his junior and senior seasons, averaging 17.2 points and 5 assists in his final year. He led Cal to the program's first post-season appearances in 26 seasons with NIT bids in 1986 and 1987 and was the first player in the  to post a . In 1992, Johnson became the first Golden Bear to have his jersey (No. 11) retired.\n\nJohnson briefly played for Cal's baseball team and the  drafted him as a  in the 23rd round of the . After playing a couple games with Oakland's minor-league team in  during the summer of 1986, Johnson ended his baseball career, finding the road to professional baseball more arduous and risky compared to basketball.\n\n\nFollowing his senior season of college basketball, the  selected Johnson with the seventh pick in the . Originally drafted by Cleveland to challenge the incumbent point guard  for the starting spot, Johnson found himself playing limited minutes as Price's backup during the .\n\n\nOn February 28, 1988, Johnson, , , and a future draft pick were traded to the  in exchange for forward , , and a future draft pick. Adjusting quickly to the change of scenery and much-increased playing time, Johnson excelled and the league named him the NBA Rookie of the Month for April 1988 as he averaged 15.1 points, an 86.4% free throw percentage, 10.6 assists, and 5.6 rebounds.\n\nIn his first full season with Phoenix, Johnson grew into one of the game's elite players, averaging 20.4 points, 12.2 assists, a 50.5% field goal percentage, and an 88.2% free-throw percentage. With those numbers, Johnson joined  and  as the only players in NBA history to average at least 20 points and 12 assists in a season. His rapid improvement earned him the 1988–89 . The 1988–89 season was the first of three straight seasons in which Johnson averaged at least 20 points and 10 assists, joining  and Isiah Thomas as the only players in league history to accomplish that feat. It also represented the beginning of a new era for the previously moribund Suns' franchise. In K.J.'s first seven full seasons in Phoenix from 1989 to 1995, the Suns won the most regular season games in the NBA (394, an average of 56 and never fewer than 53), constituting the only club to win at least 50 every year during that span, and they won the second-most playoff games (46), trailing only the Chicago Bulls.\n\nJohnson received berths to the  Team in 1990, 1991, and 1994. In the 1991 All-Star Game in Charlotte, Johnson wore number 41 instead of his familiar number 7.  announcers  and  speculated that the decision represented K.J.'s quiet way of honoring teammate Mark West, the Suns' stoic, largely unrecognized center who thanklessly executed the dirty work on the glass and in the paint.\n\nIn the , Johnson started alongside  in the Western Conference backcourt. In anticipation of the game, the ''Sporting News'' asked whether K.J. may have surpassed Magic as the best player on the court. The previous spring in the 1990 Western Conference Semifinals, Johnson led the Suns past Magic's league-best, 63-win , four games to one. Over the last two games, Johnson closed out the series by averaging 33.5 points and a dozen assists as the Suns won both Game Four and Game Five, with K.J. vastly outplaying Magic Johnson in the fourth quarter of both contests. Indeed, Johnson's clutch performances led Hall of Fame center and NBC commentator  to later remark, \"Kevin Johnson ... really came to the top of this league in the 1990 playoffs when he waxed Magic Johnson and the Lakers in the early rounds. Kevin Johnsonand the Sunstaking care of business in 1990, four to one over the Lakers ... Kevin Johnson just totally outplaying Magic.\" Johnson's performance during the 1990 playoffs led the Suns to a second consecutive berth in the Western Conference Finals as Phoenix became the only team to ever defeat 's Jazz (55 wins) and Magic Johnson's Lakers (63 wins) in the same postseason.\n\nJohnson made the playoffs every year of his career after his rookie season, reversing the fortunes of the perennially losing Phoenix Suns. The , led by Johnson and new teammate , posted an NBA-best 62–20 record and managed to make it to the , where they lost to the -led  four games to two. Johnson averaged 17.8 points and 7.9 assists in the playoffs and established an NBA record for Finals minutes played by logging 62 minutes in Game 3 (a 129–121 triple-OT victory) vs. the Bulls.\n\nBut even before Johnson played his first regular season game with Charles Barkley, he suffered an undiagnosed  in October 1992 when he attempted to lift heavy-set rookie teammate  off the ground during warmups before a preseason game. By the middle of the 1995–96 season, Johnson had suffered a second undiagnosed  . Primarily due to the groin, hamstring, quadriceps, and other muscle strains stemming from these undiagnosed hernias, Johnson missed 109 regular season games during his four seasons with Barkley from 1992–93 through 1995–96 (although he only missed one playoff game during his entire career). When diligent off-season workouts during the summer of 1996 failed to erase the abdominal and groin pain that had been plaguing Johnson since the middle of the last season, the Suns' doctors finally diagnosed the second hernia just before the start of training camp in the fall of 1996. Then, during surgery to repair the  , the Phoenix doctors discovered the second, \"hidden\" hernia that had existed for four years.\n\nDespite the undiagnosed hernia problems, K.J. continued to thrive in the postseason.\n\nIn 1994, he averaged 26.6 points and 9.6 assists in the postseason, scoring 38 points three different times in ten games and averaging 11.0 assists in those three contests.\n\nIn 1995, after an injury-riddled regular season, Johnson returned to form in the postseason. He averaged 24.8 points on 57.3% shooting from the field and 9.3 assists in ten games, including 43 points (18–24 FG) with 9 assists, 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and just 1 turnover in Game Four of the Western Conference Semifinals at Houston and 46 points (21–22 FT) with 10 assists against only 1 turnover in Game Seven. During that series, K.J. sank more three-pointers (5) than he'd hit in the entire 1994–95 regular season (4).\n\nIn game four of the previous year's series with Houston, Johnson completed a remarkable play, driving the baseline and dunking over Rockets' center . The shot became an oft-played highlight for the ages and was part of a second consecutive 38-point, 12-assist effort by the point guard.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Johnson played with the , otherwise known as Dream Team II, in the , reuniting with old teammate and point guard rival Mark Price to win the gold medal. Johnson led Dream Team II in both total assists (31) and assists per game (3.9), while shooting 47.1% (16–34) from the field and 50.0% (16–32) on two-point field goal attempts. The U.S. head coach, Don Nelson, stated, \"I really like having KJ on the court. The thing that stood out is how he sacrificed his scoring to be a distributor of the ball and make his team win. We didn't need his offense on this team. We did need his defense, penetration and assists. He gave us all three.\"\n\n\nJohnson retired after the , but returned briefly after receiving a call from his former coach and friend  during the  to replace the injured  during the . Johnson helped the Suns win their first playoff series in five years. After Phoenix lost in the second round to the Los Angeles Lakers, he retired for the second and final time.\n\nIn 2001, Johnson's No. 7 was  by the Suns and he was inducted into their .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 52 || 3 || 20.1 || .460 || .222 || .821 || 1.4 || 3.7 || 1.2 || .3 || 7.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 28 || 25 || 31.2 || .463 || .200 || .859 || '''4.3''' || 8.7 || 1.5 || .3 || 12.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| '''81''' || '''81''' || '''39.2''' || .505 || .091 || .882 || 4.2 || '''12.2''' || 1.7 || .3 || 20.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 74 || 74 || 37.6 || .499 || .195 || .838 || 3.6 || 11.4 || 1.3 || .2 || '''22.5'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 77 || 76 || 36.0 || .516 || .205 || .843 || 3.5 || 10.1 || '''2.1''' || .1 || 22.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 78 || 78 || 37.2 || .479 || .217 || .807 || 3.7 || 10.7 || 1.5 || .3 || 19.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 49 || 47 || 33.5 || .499 || .125 || .819 || 2.1 || 7.8 || 1.7 || '''.4''' || 16.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 67 || 67 || 36.6 || .487 || .222 || .819 || 2.5 || 9.5 || 1.9 || .1 || 20.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 47 || 35 || 28.8 || .470 || .154 || .810 || 2.4 || 7.7 || 1.0 || '''.4''' || 15.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 56 || 55 || 35.8 || .507 || .368 || .859 || 3.9 || 9.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 18.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 70 || 70 || 38.0 || .496 || .441 || .852 || 3.6 || 9.3 || 1.5 || .2 || 20.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 50 || 12 || 25.8 || .447 || .154 || .871 || 3.3 || 4.9 || .5 || .2 || 9.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 6 || 0 || 18.8 || '''.571''' || '''1.000''' || '''1.000''' || 2.7 || 4.0 || .3 || .0 || 6.7\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 735 || 623 || 34.1 || .493 || .305 || .841 || 3.3 || 9.1 || 1.5 || .2 || 17.9\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| All-Star\n| 3 || 1 || 17.0 || .500 || – || .333 || 1.0 || 4.3 || 1.3 || .3 || 4.3\n\n\n\n\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 12 || 12 || 41.2 || .495 || .300 || '''.927''' || 4.3 || '''12.3''' || 1.6 || .4 || 23.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 16 || 16 || 36.4 || .479 || .182 || .821 || 3.3 || 10.6 || 1.6 || .0 || 21.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 4 || 4 || 36.5 || .302 || .143 || .600 || 3.3 || 9.8 || .5 || .3 || 12.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 8 || 8 || 41.9 || .484 || '''.500''' || .861 || 4.1 || 11.6 || 1.5 || .3 || 23.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| '''23''' || '''23'''|| 39.7 || .480 || .000 || .795 || 2.7 || 7.9 || 1.5 || '''.6''' || 17.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 10 || 10 || '''42.7''' || .458 || .300 || .852 || 3.5 || 9.6 || 1.0 || .1 || '''26.6'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 10 || 10 || 37.1 || '''.573''' || '''.500''' || .845 || 4.1 || 9.3 || .9 || .4 || 24.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 4 || 4 || 37.8 || .474 || .250 || .824 || 4.3 || 10.8 || .5 || .5 || 17.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 5 || 5 || 41.6 || .295 || .136 || .879 || '''4.4''' || 6.0 || '''2.6''' || .0 || 16.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 4 || 1 || 30.5 || .548 || .250 || .667 || 2.3 || 4.8 || .5 || .3 || 13.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| 9 || 0 || 14.3 || .324 || .000 || .833 || 1.4 || 2.6 || .3 || .1 || 3.2\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 105 || 93 || 36.9 || .469 || .244 || .833 || 3.3 || 8.9 || 1.3 || .3 || 19.3\n\n\n\n \nThe Kevin Johnson Corporation includes operations of several subsidiary organizations specializing in real estate development and management, sports management, and business acquisition. A key component of The Kevin Johnson Corporation includes appearances and public speaking engagements for corporations, academic institutions, and community organizations.\n\n\nIn 1989, while still an NBA player, Johnson founded St. HOPE (Helping Others Pursue Excellence) as an after-school program for kids in his native  neighborhood of Sacramento, California. St. HOPE eventually expanded to run as a nonprofit umbrella organization that consisted of three divisions: St. HOPE Academy, St. HOPE Public Schools, and St. HOPE Development Corporation. This encompassed the new vision to be a nonprofit community development corporation whose mission is to \"revitalize communities through public education, civic leadership, economic development, and the arts.\" Johnson served as CEO of St. HOPE until January 2008.\n\nThe St. HOPE Development Corporation, founded in 1994, has focused its efforts on Oak Park. The Development Corporation has enabled the renovation of a number of projects including a historic bank building that is now a local  branch, a Victorian house that has been converted to office space, and a 25,000 square foot art gallery and retail complex that includes the Guild Theater and 40 Acres Art Gallery.\n\nSt. HOPE Public Schools is a pre-K-through-12th-grade independent  system that provides education to nearly 2,000 students in seven small schools. One of the schools St. HOPE impacted was Sacramento High School (colloquially known as Sac High and now the ), where three generations of Johnson's family including him attended. In October 2002, Sac High was at risk of being shut down and restricted into five smaller schools due to low test scores. But by January 2003, Johnson had raised seed money from the  and drafted a petition to reopen Sac High as an independent charter school.

Both campaigns released statements indicating that they intended to compete in the general election.\n\nHowever, after a poll believed to be conducted on behalf of supporters of first-placed  testing two-way match-ups was fielded, two residents of the district, including former Liccardo campaign finance director and current donor Jonathan Padilla, requested a recount; Liccardo himself was ineligible to do so because he does not live in the district. Liccardo's campaign denied responsibility, though they agreed the recount was necessary, saying \"every vote should be counted.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the recount, Simitian was ultimately eliminated and Low advanced to the general election by a 5-vote margin.\n\nIn October 2024, good-government group Defend the Vote filed an FEC complaint against Low, alleging that he had spent nearly $600,000 from his state campaign account on ads that were distributed across the congressional district. Defend the Vote argued that the move violated federal campaign finance laws, as state campaigns can accept higher individual contributions than federal campaigns, and can receive political action committee and corporation donations directly.\n\nIn wake of the expenditures, an attorney for Liccardo sent cease and desist letters to five TV stations that broadcast the ads. The Mercury News Editorial Board reaffirmed their endorsement of Liccardo, criticizing Low for “putting political self-interest ahead of campaign integrity.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter redistricting added Campbell to Assemblymember 's district, Low announced he would run in the new  spanning , , and .\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  issued a proclamation naming June 5, 2006, \"Evan Low Day\" in the City and County of San Francisco.\n\nAssemblymember Low has been named \"Legislator of the Year\" by the , TechNet, The Computing Technology Industry Association, California Faculty Association, Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, California District Attorneys Association and Faculty Association of California Community Colleges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When asked in an interview with the  about why he decided to run for the Assembly in 2008, Monning cited California's structural budget limitations saying California was, \"only one of three states in the union that require a 2/3 vote in both houses to pass a budget.\" This limitation made it difficult to secure adequate funding for such needs as healthcare and education. Monning hoped to work with community groups and other legislators to effect reform in this and other areas including electoral, campaign finance and economic justice.\n\nIn 2012 Monning was elected to the California State Senate after the incumbent, , R-San Luis Obispo, chose not to run in the newly drawn 17th Senate district.

About three months later, the bill died in committee.\n\n\n\nMonning authored a bill to protect California farm workers from sexual harassment and violence. Signed by Governor  on September 28, 2014, SB 1087 followed a 2013 investigation by , UC Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program FRONTLINE, and the . The investigation found that hundreds of female agriculture workers said they had been harassed and assaulted in the fields with minimal response from their supervisors or from law enforcement. The law took effect on January 1, 2015. \"Female farmworkers are among the most vulnerable and invisible of the state's farm worker population,\" said Monning. \"[SB 1087] will require sexual harassment prevention training for farm labor contractors, supervisors, and employees, and is the first step to help protect these workers from unwanted sexual advances and sexual violence.\"\n\nSenator Monning successfully authored another bill, SB 168 in 2013, to help agricultural workers get back wages and penalties owed by state-licensed farm labor contractors. According to Monning, some California contractors had fraudulently dissolved and moved their assets to new corporations, leaving farm workers without anyone to file a claim against. \"This measure is modeled after previous legislation in the garment manufacturing and car wash industries to address fraudulent successor business scams,\"  said Monning  \"The workers most affected and victimized by such unscrupulous practices are farm workers.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2015 Monning co-sponsored, with  (D-Davis), SB 128, the . The bill was modeled after Oregon's . The law authorizes adults with six months or less to live to request a doctor's prescription for life-ending medication.  It passed the California Senate easily, but stalled in the Assembly. In a legislative session in September dedicated to healthcare, several amendments were introduced, and eventually the bill passed in the Assembly 42–33, and the Senate 23-14 It was co-authored by Assembly Member  (D-Stockton). California governor  signed the California End of Life Option Act on October 5, 2015, and it went into effect on June 9, 2016. California thus became the fifth state to pass a Death With Dignity law. In a 2018 interview with the ''Monterey County Weekly'' Monning claimed that the End of Life Option Act was \"one of his greatest legislative achievements\". He was very moved by the testimony of terminally ill people in Sacramento, \"They knew that they weren't going to be able to benefit from it (the Act), and yet they still came, facing their terminal conditions, making sure that those who followed them would have options that they didn't have\".\n\n\n\nSenator Monning believes climate change is the largest long-term threat to humanity and that it will also negatively affect public health and coastal communities. In the 2015–2016 legislative session Senator Monning co-authored Senate Bill 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. This complex bill was intended to increase the state's energy efficiency, reduce petroleum use in vehicles and set new standards for California's  (RPS). Under this bill the state of California would be required to generate half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The bill was signed by Governor Jerry Brown October 7, 2015. Other sponsors of the bill were primary sponsor Senator Kevin de León, Senator , Senator , Assemblyman  and Assemblyman .\n\n\n\nMonning authored the Safe, Clean, Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2019 (SB 200) making available $1.3 billion over ten years in funding for community projects though .

CleanPowerSF is a publicly owned clean energy program that allow residents to choose to buy electricity generated from renewable source rather than from , the dominant utility in the city. Ultimately, the plan will use the program’s revenue stream to help construct the city’s own renewable energy infrastructure, including wind and solar generators.\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the Board of Supervisors, an average of 157 residences (32 of which were subsidized units) were built in the Mission per year. According to one estimate, Campos opposed the construction of units capable of housing 6,058 people, including subsidized housing for 3,930 lower-income people. Among the developments that Campos opposed was a 2016 proposal to develop a lot containing an abandoned warehouse into housing for 227 people, including 45 low-income residents. Campos argued that the development would harm the vibrancy of his district. The proposal was blocked; by 2022, the lot still contained only an abandoned warehouse.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, while he was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Campos introduced proposals to prohibit the construction of market-rate housing in his district in San Francisco. While running for office in 2022, Campos said he had changed his view on banning market-rate housing. In 2016, Campos held rallies opposing a \"density bonus\" proposal whereby developers in San Francisco would be allowed to build taller buildings in exchange for increasing the number of affordable housing units in the buildings.\n\nIn April 2016, Campos introduced legislation that would fine  companies such as  $1000 a day for each listing that wasn't registered with the City of San Francisco. After the Board of Supervisors approved the legislation, Airbnb sued the City, claiming that the law violated the Communications Decency Act, which prohibits the government from holding websites accountable for the content published by users. Campos then introduced new amendments to the legislation to attempt to address the challenges in the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2021, Campos expressed opposition to a proposal to build 495 apartment units (25% of which would have been affordable housing) on a  valet parking lot. Campos said that his position was not \"anti-housing\" – rather, he said that the apartments would cause displacement: \"there is a very real fear of displacement of the people who live around [the parking lot].\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn August 1, 2013, Campos filed papers at  to run for the California State Assembly seat in the  (eastern half of San Francisco). Campos advanced to the general election with   in the primary on Tuesday, June 3, 2014, with 43 percent of the vote. Chiu won 48 percent of the vote and Republican candidate David Salaverry won 8.5 percent. Chiu beat Campos in the general election with 51 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy September 2021, Campos had announced his intention to run for the 17th Assembly District seat that would be vacated by David Chiu when he would become . In the special election held on February 15, 2022, Campos ended up in second place with 33,448 votes (35.67%). Since no candidate received 50% of the votes, the top two candidates, Campos and , moved onto the  on April 19, 2022.\n\nWhen filing his papers for candidacy for the special election, Campos listed his occupation as a \"civil rights attorney\". In a letter to the California Secretary of State, Matt Haney challenged the accuracy of that statement, arguing that the role of a DA’s chief of staff is to oversee operations and administration, not practice law. When the  rejected Haney's challenge, Haney filed a lawsuit against the office. In February 2022, Judge Shelleyanne Chang of the Sacramento Superior Court ruled in favor of Haney citing that the civil rights attorney designation was “misleading voters.” Judge Chang ordered that Campos could no longer list his occupation as a civil rights attorney or criminal justice attorney and must list his occupation as criminal justice administrator in the run off election ballot.\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, Campos was named one of seven deputy executives for  to lead the Division of Equity & Social Justice focused on , immigration, , labor, and  issues.

Avalos represented  in San Francisco, consisting of the , , , , and  districts. Avalos was elected on November 4, 2008, in the  and took office on January 8, 2009. He was re-elected in the 2012 San Francisco election with 94 percent of the vote, and  of office in January 2017.\n\n\nAvalos is Mexican-American/Chicano and was born in . Along with his three brothers and two sisters, he was raised by his mother Erlinda, an office worker, and his father Hector, a longshoreman and member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. His parents divorced when he was young, and his mother cared for them on her own. Avalos moved to Andover, Massachusetts as a teenager and graduated from Andover High School in 1982.\n\nAfter graduating from Andover, Avalos moved back to California, where he soon attended the  and earned a bachelor's degree in English. In 1989, Avalos moved to San Francisco, California where he later earned a Masters in Social Work from .\n\n\n\nBefore being elected to the Board of Supervisors, Avalos was a legislative aide for supervisor .\n\n\nOn November 4, 2008, Avalos was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Under the City's  system, Avalos won the election for District 11 supervisor with 28.23% of the total votes in round one and 52.93% in round four.\n\n\nIn 2010, Avalos passed legislation to set a 5-cent fee per serving of alcohol to raise funding for emergency services in response to alcohol consumption. Mayor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill and Avalos failed to garner the eight votes to override the veto.\n\nIn 2010, Avalos crafted an increase to San Francisco's Real Estate Transfer Tax for properties valued over $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Voters approved his proposal, Proposition N, on November 2, 2010. Prop N has since raised hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the City.\n\nIn 2012, Avalos worked with Mayor Ed Lee to update the City's business tax by creating a progressive gross receipts tax that included an exemption for small and low-profit businesses. The final ordinance the Board of Supervisors placed on the ballot generated millions more in new revenue than the Mayor's revenue-neutral measure, raising $32&nbsp;million annually subject to the consumer price index. The new revenues ensured funding for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund that passed on the same ballot.\n\nIn 2015, Avalos challenged Mayor Lee's $250&nbsp;million housing bond by crafting a measure which resulted in the Mayor increasing his bond to $310&nbsp;million. The larger bond enabled affordable housing projects to be financed in greater amounts in District 11 and District 9 than under Mayor Lee's original plan. The new revenues ensured funding for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund that passed on the same ballot.\n\n\nIn December 2010, working with a coalition of labor and Black, Brown, and Asian community organizations, Avalos passed the strongest Local Hiring Ordinance in the country. The ordinance was crafted during the great recession years at a time when San Francisco had one of its highest unemployment rates in decades. Since the 1990s, the City relied on a nonbinding local hiring ordinance called First Source, which never achieved measurable success. Avalos' Local Hiring Ordinance is based on the principle that public spending and development should benefit local residents and disadvantaged workers. The ordinance targeted neighborhoods with the highest rates of unemployment.\n\nThe Local Hiring Ordinance required publicly funded contractors to hire local residents starting at a rate of 20% for each trade working on a project, rising by 5% each year up to 50%. Despite early opposition from the Building Trades Council, the ordinance went to a local resident-hiring rate of more than 50% after six years. Avalos later expanded the ordinance to apply to private development on public land.\n\n\nIn his second term in office and his role as a director of the  (BAAQMD), Avalos championed environmental initiatives such as , the City's renewable power program, and worked to adopt the BAAQMD's 10 Point Climate Action Program.\n\nIn 2013, Avalos initiated an effort to convince the San Francisco Employees Retirement System Board to divest from fossil fuel corporations. Avalos also worked on opposition to the  and rulemaking to limit emissions from petroleum refineries, particularly around working-class communities of color. \n\nIn 2016, Avalos sponsored and passed the Keep It in the Ground Ordinance banning the use of San Francisco public land for fossil fuel extraction and setting in motion the closure of Chevron oil drilling on City-owned land in Kern River Oil Field in . \n\n\nIn 2013 Avalos updated the City's Sanctuary City status by passing the Due Process for All Ordinance in response to the Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency's Secure Communities or S-Comm program. The measure sought to prohibit unconstitutional detention of any person in San Francisco law enforcement custody beyond his or her release date at the request of immigration officials. The measure also sought to limit involvement by local law enforcement with S-Comm, which has resulted in thousands of deportations nationwide, dividing families and fracturing communities. The Secure Communities Program was criticized for creating a dragnet wherein even U.S. citizens were detained and was finally terminated in 2014 and replaced with the Priority Enforcement Program. In 2016, Avalos introduced legislation to set a common standard between San Francisco's landmark Sanctuary City Ordinance and the Due Process for All Ordinance.\n\n\nHis office funded neighborhood planning efforts that led to the City setting aside land for transit-oriented affordable housing. Avalos' efforts to address community workforce development needs led to the creation of a workforce center in District 11 focusing on employment development and enforcement of workers' rights. Avalos supported District 11 community efforts to develop urban agriculture and  projects. In other district initiatives, Avalos helped foster community-led grantmaking programs; neighborhood art projects in which neighborhood artists created murals, public plazas, and sculptures; and new walkways, stairs, and pathways in neighborhood parks and open spaces. \n\nIn 2010, Avalos passed legislation affirming the Ocean Avenue Community Benefit Initiative, supporting years of community effort and setting Ocean Ave on a stronger trajectory of sustainable neighborhood serving economic growth. Despite limited economic growth in the southern neighborhoods of District 11, in 2015 Avalos succeeded in bringing a branch of the San Francisco Federal Credit Union to the Excelsior District. \n\nDuring the  years and afterward, mortgage defaults and foreclosure rates were particularly high in San Francisco's south and southeastern neighborhoods. Avalos worked with the Association of California Communities for Empowerment (ACCE) to occupy homes where households face evictions after struggling to modify their mortgages. With ACCE, Avalos advocated at local and federal levels to create home loan principal reduction programs and to strengthen community development financial institutions' leverage to address foreclosure and enable households to modify their mortgage with principal reduction.\n\nFollowing the 2008–09 recession and the home loan crisis, starting in 2011, Avalos championed the idea of a Municipal Bank for San Francisco. In 2012, Avalos began the city's process of studying the creation of a . In 2016, San Francisco supervisors unanimously passed legislation by Avalos cutting ties with Wells Fargo, following the bank's \"phony accounts\" scandal. San Francisco supervisors approved a resolution in 2019 urging California lawmakers to allow the city to create its own public bank.\n\n\n\nOn April 18, 2011, Avalos filed to run for mayor of San Francisco as a progressive candidate. Avalos placed second in the race after incumbent Mayor .\n\nOn January 18, 2019, the  fined Avalos $12,146 for failing to properly disclose campaign finances from his unsuccessful run for mayor in 2011. According to the Ethics Commission, Avalos' campaign committee improperly reported $26,506 – or 11 percent – of his total contributions. The committee also failed to maintain complete records for $391,594 in expenditures, 60 percent of the total money spent. Avalos accepted the settlement in front of the commission.\n\n\nAvalos was married to Karen Zapata, a public school teacher, and they have two children. They separated in 2014 after Avalos revealed he had had an affair with his legislative aide, Raquel Redondiez. Avalos and Zapata divorced in 2017. They continue to co-parent their children. Avalos married Raquel Redondiez in June 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And on December 23, 2011, he was appointed to serve on a bi-cameral conference committee to find bi-partisan solutions on middle-class tax cuts, unemployment insurance, and the Medicare physician payment rate.\n\nBecerra had a seat on the  and was the first Latino to serve on the committee.\n\n\nA writer for '''' described Becerra as a \"strident supporter of women's health and reproductive rights\"; ''The New York Times'' stated that he has been \"vocal in the Democratic Party about fighting for women's health\".

Early December reports that Biden planned to nominate Becerra as  rendered such speculation moot.\n\n\n\nIn the 2026 California gubernatorial election, incumbent   will be ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits. In February 2024,  reported that Becerra was considering a run for Governor, and that he or affiliated individuals had approached a political consulting firm to that effect, a potential violation of the . Becerra's tenure as Secretary of Health and Human Services was described as \"frustrating and at times rocky\" by the Politico article and in a previous interview Becerra said that he missed being California Attorney General because of the autonomy of the position. \n\n\n State Convention in 2019]]\nBecerra accepted  's offer to be the  on December 1, 2016. The  confirmed Becerra to the post on January 23, 2017. He succeeded , who was elected to the . Becerra was sworn in on January 24, 2017, becoming the first Latino to serve as California's attorney general. Becerra was elected to a full four-year term in , after defeating Republican challenger Steven Bailey and securing 61&nbsp;percent of the vote.\n\nWhile Attorney General, Becerra was challenged the policymaking by President Trump that would disproportionately impact California, home to one in ten Americans. He delivered the Democratic Spanish-language response to President Trump's 2019  address.\n\nDuring his tenure as California Attorney General, Xavier Becerra filed 122 lawsuits against the Trump administration, focusing on environmental and healthcare issues. Notably, he successfully defended significant national policies such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Becerra created an  bureau at the California Department of Justice. Among other legal actions, it opposed the effort to expand  due to concerns regarding , intervened to halt a proposed waterfront cement plant in Vallejo, citing significant concerns over increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and supported the City of Arvin's oil and gas ordinance, endorsing a 300-foot buffer for homes, schools, and hospitals, and confirming that such local ordinances are not preempted by state law. The bureau also intervened in a lawsuit against the city of Fresno in 2018, leading to the city rescinding its approval of a large industrial warehouse project due to inadequate environmental review. By focusing on disparities such as the prevalence of polluting facilities near low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, the bureau's work has significantly addressed environmental justice concerns.\n\n\n\n\nOn July 31, 2019, Becerra achieved a significant legal victory when a Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction to stop Westlands Water District's involvement in a project to raise the Shasta Dam. Becerra's lawsuit argued that the project contravened the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, threatening the McCloud River's ecology. Federal studies revealed that raising the dam would expand the inundation of the river by 39%, adversely affecting its fisheries, habitats, and submerging sacred sites of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe.\n\n\nIn September 2018, Becerra filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission. This action was in response to over 12 million gallons of untreated wastewater from the Tijuana River Watershed flowing into California, violating the Clean Water Act. The untreated wastewater, containing hazardous levels of pesticides, heavy metals, and bacteria, posed a significant threat to human health and the environment.\n\n\nIn October 2020, Becerra achieved a significant legal victory in protecting the Redwood City Salt Ponds, vital to the San Francisco Bay's ecosystem. The U.S. District Court's ruling against the EPA's exclusion of the Salt Ponds from the Clean Water Act safeguards these areas from urban development. Additionally, efforts to restore the Salt Ponds as salt marshes and wetlands have been instrumental in enhancing the Bay's ecological health and bolstering climate change resilience, particularly against sea level rise.\n\n\nIn February 2020, Becerra, exercising his independent authority as defined in the California Constitution (art. V, § 13) and Government Code (§§ 12660–12612), filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration on behalf of the People of the State of California. The legal challenge focused on the federal government's inadequacy in protecting endangered species in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. It specifically scrutinized the biological opinions provided under the Endangered Species Act in relation to federal water export operations, emphasizing their insufficient protection of vulnerable species and habitats in the Bay-Delta area. On May 11, 2020, Becerra secured a preliminary injunction in this lawsuit against the Trump Administration for unlawfully expanding water export operations in the Central Valley.\n\n\n\n\nOn June 4, 2019, Becerra announced the arrest of Naasón Joaquín García, the leader of the international religious organization La Luz Del Mundo, along with several co-defendants. The defendants were charged with serious offenses including human trafficking, production of child pornography, and forcible rape of a minor. The alleged crimes occurred between 2015 and 2018 and involved coercing victims into sexual acts under the guise of religious authority. The criminal complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court accused García and his associates, Alondra Ocampo, Azalea Rangel Melendez (who remains at large), and Susana Medina Oaxaca, of committing 26 felonies in Southern California. With this arrest, Becerra emphasized the commitment of the California Department of Justice to combat human trafficking and protect the rights of survivors. The arrests were part of a collaborative effort involving multiple law enforcement agencies and were initiated by a tip received through the clergy abuse online complaint form of the California Department of Justice. On June 8, 2022, Naasón Joaquín García was sentenced to more than 16 years in a California prison.\n\n\nOn January 17, 2020, Becerra and Riverside Police Chief Larry Gonzalez announced the successful execution of \"Operation Blocc Buster,\" targeting the Casa Blanca Gangster Crips street gang in Riverside. This operation led to the arrest of 15 individuals and the seizure of 14 firearms, including assault weapons, along with methamphetamine and cocaine. The Casa Blanca Gangster Crips, known for violent crimes such as murder, assault, and narcotics trafficking, have been a significant concern in the south Riverside community.\n\nThis operation is part of a broader initiative under Becerra's leadership, where the California Department of Justice actively collaborates with local and federal agencies to dismantle various criminal street gangs across California, enhancing public safety and addressing gang-related violence and crime.  This comprehensive anti-gang initiative has led to hundreds of arrests, significantly disrupting various criminal street gangs. Key operations under this initiative include a May 2017 crackdown on the Sureño gang and its connections to the Mexican Mafia in Merced County, and a June 2017 operation against the Sureño gang in San Bernardino County. In November 2017, efforts focused on members of the Mexican mafia and drug cartels across Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Orange Counties. December 2017 saw the takedown of gangs including the MOB, Flyboys, East Coast Crips, and others in Stockton.\n\nFurther operations throughout 2018 and 2019 maintained this momentum. In August 2018, an operation targeted the MS-13 gang in the Central Valley and beyond. October 2018 featured a major operation dismantling Riverside County's largest criminal street gang. The following year, multiple operations were directed against Norteño street gangs in Kings, Tulare, and Stanislaus Counties, as well as in Stockton. In December 2019, the Country Boy Crips in south Bakersfield were the focus of a significant operation. These targeted actions reflect the Becerra's ongoing dedication to curbing gang-related violence and crime, ensuring safer communities across California.\n\n\nOn September 13, 2019, Becerra of California announced the filing of charges against Jing Chiang Huang, Shu Mei Lin, Shao Lee, Peihsin Lee, Pengcheng Cai, and Dafeng Wen for their alleged involvement in a statewide organized crime ring engaged in sex trafficking, tax fraud, and money laundering. This legal action, the product of a collaborative effort between the California Department of Justice, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, and several other law enforcement partners, asserts that from 2015 to 2019, the defendants committed 13 felonies related to sex trafficking. The criminal complaint suggests that the accused used Backpage.com for their operations and forcibly coerced individuals into prostitution at various brothel locations, employing tactics like withholding passports and threatening job opportunities to maintain control over their victims. The announcement of these charges underlines Attorney Becerra's ongoing commitment to eradicating sex trafficking and protecting the rights of survivors in California.  Five suspects were sentenced in March 2022.\n\n\nBecerra brought fourteen felony charges against  activists for recording fourteen videos (see ), and one felony charge for conspiring to invade privacy, on March 28, 2017. The charges were dismissed by a California Superior Court judge in June for not stating the names of those recorded and the specific dates of the recordings; the charges were refiled with the names and dates in July 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Becerra threatened \"legal action\" against reporters who had received records of California law enforcement officers who had been convicted of crimes during the past decade.\n\nIn December 2020, Becerra was faulted by state district attorneys for not taking leadership to help stop unemployment fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic, in what was described as the \"biggest taxpayer fraud in California history\". In January 2021, investigators said the total fraud was over $11 billion, with $19 billion in claims still under investigation. Most of this money will likely never be recovered, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his numerous legal challenges against the Trump administration, a significant aspect of Xavier Becerra's tenure as California Attorney General was his defense of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy before the United States Supreme Court. This defense was crucial for the approximately 650,000 Dreamers across the United States, with more than a quarter of them residing in California.  In June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a ruling that upheld the DACA policy, marking a significant victory for these Dreamers. The California Department of Justice, under Becerra's leadership, played a pivotal role in this outcome. In November 2019, Becerra led a coalition of 21 attorneys general to defend DACA against the Trump Administration's attempt to terminate it. The Court found that the administration's actions to end DACA were unlawful.\n\n\nAs the Attorney General of California, Becerra led the multistate lawsuit to defend, and ultimately save, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), culminating in the significant Supreme Court ruling in California v. Texas on June 17, 2021. In this capacity, he led the legal challenge against efforts to dismantle the ACA, emphasizing the Act's critical importance in providing healthcare to millions of Americans, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Becerra's staunch defense of the ACA at the Supreme Court highlighted his commitment to ensuring accessible healthcare for all. His efforts were pivotal in upholding the ACA, a decision that affirmed the continuation of essential health protections and services across the United States.\n\n\nIn February 2019, Becerra, Governor Gavin Newsom, and 15 other states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the president's  to fund a wall at the southern U.S. border. As of September 26, 2019, Becerra had sued the Trump administration 62&nbsp;times in total.\n\nThe Trump administration opened 1&nbsp;million acres in California to  and drilling in December 2019. Under the new policy, the  proposed new lease sales for oil and gas extraction along \"California's  and , touching eight counties and including 400,000&nbsp;acres of public land\". California officials and agencies, including Becerra, filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management in January 2020.\n\nDespite the multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration filed with other state attorneys general, Becerra had not joined antitrust efforts against any major tech companies. His office would not disclose whether it had examined any tech companies and had not endorsed any joint investigations with other states. On December 9, 2020, it was reported that Becerra's office had joined 47 other states and the  in an antitrust lawsuit against , headquartered in California.\n\n\nAs Attorney General of California, Becerra was tasked with writing ballot titles and summaries that appeared on voter information guides and ballots in both the 2018 and 2020 elections. Proponents accused Becerra multiple times of writing biased descriptions that violated the law, which requires \"a true and impartial statement of the purpose\" of measures. In one of many unsuccessful lawsuits against Becerra, a state judge wrote that attorneys general have \"wide latitude\" in how they write ballot descriptions. Critics said the responsibility to write the ballot title and summary should be transferred to a different, non-partisan office.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Joe Biden's election as president in , Becerra was considered a candidate for . The ''New York Times'' reported in early December 2020 that Biden would nominate Becerra as . His nomination to lead the Health and Human Services Department has been criticized by pro-life and conservative leaders led by , citing his \"absence of health care experience and his disregard for people of faith\". Becerra's nomination was deadlocked by the  on March 10, 2021. One day later, on March 11, 2021, Becerra's nomination was discharged from the Finance Committee by the entire Senate, in a vote of 51–48. He was confirmed by the Senate in a vote of 50–49 on March 18, 2021, with all but one Democrat present and one Republican, , voting in favor. This was the narrowest vote for any of Biden's cabinet positions. On March 22, 2021, Becerra was sworn in to be the new secretary.\n\n\n and Secretary of Veterans Affairs , June 4, 2021]]\nSoon after officially becoming the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Becerra released a statement praising the  and encouraging people to keep enrolling in its health care program. Becerra also became Secretary during the height of the , of which his cabinet department the U.S. Health and Human Services was mainly responsible for mitigating the pandemic's effects to the American public.\n\nBecerra is credited for his critical efforts to preserve reproductive rights across the country, to expand  and  postpartum coverage for more than half the states in the nation  and slashing disparities in access to public health toolsparticularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He has consistently cited curbing health care costs, advancing women's health, and tackling gaps in who has access to health care as big prioritiesalong with protecting public health.\n\nBecerra has overseen one of the biggest reform efforts of sub-agencies in HHS's history, including at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBecerra has been criticized as health and human services secretary for being absent in the public eye during the pandemic, for confusing messaging by federal public health authorities and for the subsequent loss of public trust, and for his collaborative management style while serving as secretary; his defenders said he was given an unclear role as secretary. Becerra was similarly criticized following his agency's response to the  amid issues with health policy communication and what was widely considered a slow response; White House officials said that Becerra sought to scapegoat the states  rather than take responsibility for the subpar response.\n\nOn October 6, 2022, Becerra was tasked by President Biden with expeditiously reviewing the  classification of .\n\nIn 2023, '''' published investigations regarding immigrant child laborers who are working in violation of child labor laws across the U.S. According to the Times' reports, \"Again and again, veteran government staffers and outside contractors told the Health and Human Services Department, including in reports that reached Secretary Xavier Becerra, that children appeared to be at risk\". The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for the welfare of these children.\n\n\nBecerra is married to physician Carolina Reyes, and they have three daughters.

He was previously a member of the  and the  City Council.\n\n\nKoretz earned a  in  from  in 1979, where he was a founder of the \"Bruin Democrats\". While still a student at UCLA in the 1970s, he ran and was defeated for a seat on the  Board of Education. After graduation, Koretz worked as an aide to former Los Angeles City Councilmember  in 1975, and next as an aide to Los Angeles City Councilmember  in 1984.\n\nAfter his marriage, he and his wife, Gail, moved less than a mile away from his parents' home to an area where his father lived upon immigrating to Los Angeles in 1939 after escaping Nazi Germany. Koretz cites his experience growing up as the son of an immigrant parent who worked as a waiter and union member of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union as one of his biggest influences.\n\n\nIn 1984, Koretz supported the creation of the City of  from what was then unincorporated . Koretz campaigned for the city's incorporation while managing the City Council campaign of Alan Viterbi and served as Viterbi's deputy after his election. Upon Viterbi's retirement in 1988, Koretz was elected to the  City Council.\n\nAs Councilman, Koretz appointed  to the city's Rent Stabilization Commission in 1992. Norte was the commission's first openly gay chair for two one-year terms. Koretz also appointed   leader attorney  to replace Norte as Koretz's appointee to the Rent Stabilization Commission. Duran would go on to succeed Koretz on the West Hollywood City Council.\n\n\nIn 1988, Koretz sponsored a citywide ban on s, which built momentum for a subsequent statewide \"assault weapons\" ban. In 1996, Koretz co-sponsored the city's ban on \".\" The city was the first to enact such a ban, which survived various legal challenges by the . Koretz also sponsored an ordinance limiting handgun purchases to one gun per month in order to cut the resale of guns on the black market.\n\nKoretz served as Mayor and City Councilman for twelve years before being elected to the State Assembly.\n\nKoretz's former colleague on the West Hollywood City Council, Abbe Land, was a candidate for Koretz's seat in the , and faced former Los Angeles City Council member  in the June 6, 2006 Democratic primary. Koretz endorsed Feuer, who defeated Land, winning 52.4% of the vote to her 36.3%.\n\n\nKoretz represented the 42nd district in the  from 2000 to 2006, serving the maximum three terms allowed under   law. The district included , , , and the portions of the City of Los Angeles encompassing the , , , , , , , , , and /.\n\n\nFrom his first year in the Assembly to his exit due to term limits, Koretz served as the Chair of the Assembly Labor Committee. He also chaired the Assembly Select Committee on Gun Violence and the Assembly Select Committee on California's nursing shortage. Koretz was also a member of the Health, Public Safety, Business & Professions, Insurance and Natural Resources committees.\n\n\nKoretz was the first Southern California Director of the California League of Conservation Voters and served as administrative director of the Ecology Center of Southern California. In the Assembly, he introduced legislation requiring retailers profiting from the most commonly littered items to share some of the costs of removing trash from storm water runoff, and he is the joint-author of legislation to ban the use of dry cleaner solutions found to be carcinogenic.\n\n\nIn June 2007, Koretz was appointed by Assembly Speaker  to the California Board of Podriatic Medicine.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Koretz began his first term as a City Councilmember representing the 5th District of Los Angeles. He has been re-elected twice to the role, in 2013 and 2017. In 2017, Koretz secured 65.88% of the vote in the city's primary election.\n\n\nIn 2018, Koretz lobbied successfully against California Senate Bill 827, which would have removed city control over local zoning. Koretz stated that the bill would \"have a neighborhood with little 1920s, '30s and '40s single-family homes look like  10 years later\".\n\nIn 2020, Paul Koretz, citing public safety concerns, voted against a bill to reduce the LAPD budget which passed by an 11–3 vote.\n\nIn the wake of  and other Councilmembers, Paul Koretz was one of the first Councilmembers, along with Mike Bonin and Nithya Raman, to call for the resignations of Martinez, Kevin De Leon, and Gil Cedillo.\n\n\nKoretz chaired the City Council's Personnel, Audits and Animal Welfare Committee since 2011 and lists an array of achievements related to animal rights and animal well-being during his tenure.\n\n'''Declawing Cats Ban'''\n\nIn 2009, Koretz called for a city-wide ban on the declawing of cats, saying the procedure caused ‘unnecessary pain, anguish and permanent disability’ to cats. The council gave the ordinance unanimous final approval positioning the city as one of eight in the State to ban this procedure.\n\n'''Ban on Puppy Mills'''\n\nIn 2011, Koretz introduced a motion that prohibited the sale and purchase of pets bred in puppy and kitten mills. Koretz cited the often horrible, inhumane conditions in which animals are bred which lead to disease, and long-term behavior problems in cats and dogs. The mills also contribute to overpopulation, and the euthanasia of hundreds of thousands of animals. The proposal had the goal of increasing the number of animals who are adopted, rather than euthanized, from city shelters. On October 31, 2012 -Los Angeles City Banned the Sale of Commercially Bred Puppies and Kittens.\n\n'''Protecting Elephants'''\n\nIn 2013, Koretz stood before Council asking the city of Los Angeles to take action preventing cruelty to elephants traveling with circuses. Koretz stated that he did his own investigation about circus practices before asking the council to take action. He played a video showing a young elephant hogtied in a pen during training sessions. In another scene, an elephant can be heard making sounds of apparent distress after an animal prod is applied to its skin by a trainer which was so distressful that Council President Herb Wesson cut off the video, provided by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, after a few minutes saying: “Mr. Koretz, I believe we’ve seen more than enough,” Wesson said. “I’m ready to vote.”  The Los Angeles City Council voted to ban the use of bullhooks on circus elephants.\n\nKoretz advocated for Billy, an aging elephant housed at the Los Angeles Zoo to be retired to a sanctuary 3 times over the course of a decade. First in 2009, second in 2018, with then Councilman Mitch O’Farrell, and again in 2022 saying that “The zoo has successfully, up to this point, waited me out.” In addition to support from elephant advocates, Cher and Lily Tomlin, Koretz stated in his motion that Billy was \"alone in a small enclosure where he was kept on hard surfaces not considered beneficial for his feet and joints, and allegedly received a lack of sufficient exercise and stimulation [and Billy has] long has been exhibiting abnormal (stereotypic) behavioral patterns many elephant experts characterize as indicating detrimental mental health impacts from that environment.”\n\n\nIn response to poor conditions in the Los Angeles Animal Shelter system in 2022, Koretz held a series of City Council Committee hearings with extensive public comment which led to the creation of a 48-page report detailing both whistleblower concerns and recommendations on how to improve shelter conditions. Koretz also proposed reinstating volunteers, increasing funding, expanding play programs, and improving volunteer relations. He noted, however, that neither the Personnel, Audits and Animal Welfare committee, nor he, as an individual Councilmember without full Council approval, has “an ability to order the Department of Animal Services to do anything.”\n\nThese actions were taken in response to Los Angeles Times articles which found that dogs were often confined for weeks at a time and several volunteers who were reportedly fired after whistleblowing on the shelter's staff shortages and inhumane conditions.\n\n\n\nFor over 10 years, Koretz remained the only constant member of the City Council's Energy, Climate Change, Environment Justice and River Committee.\n\n'''Beyond Coal'''\n\nIn 2014, Koretz was the first City Councilmember to sign on to the  campaign and he introduced a motion to significantly reduce carbon pollution in the City of Los Angeles, the first motion of its kind to be introduced in a major U.S. city. The motion called for the city to reduce its overall carbon output by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 and also requested that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the largest publicly owned utility in the nation, subscribe to a timeline that achieves carbon reductions that are 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Ultimately, this led to the demolition of the Navajo Generating Plant, the largest coal producing plant in the Western US, in 2022.  “The demolition of the smokestacks at NGS is a solemn event,” said Nicole Horseherder, executive director of the Navajo environmental grassroots group Tó Nizhóní Ání. “It’s a reminder of decades of exploitation subsidized by cheap coal and water from the Navajo and Hopi.”\n\n'''Climate Emergency Mobilization Office'''\n\nKoretz and Councilmember Bob Blumenfield introduced a motion to create a Climate Emergency Mobilization Office working with the LEAP L.A Coalition at the beginning of 2018, following massive winter wildfires. This motion positioned Los Angeles as the first city in the world to signal action must be taken to mitigate drastic climate change. The office launched in 2021 with former Mayor Eric Garcetti's support.\n\n'''Building Decarbonization Ordinance'''\n\nIn 2021, Koretz authored a motion to decarbonize city buildings, making all new buildings in the city of Los Angeles net zero carbon by 2030 and decarbonizing all existing buildings by 2050. The motion said that \"many well-meaning policies to combat climate change and pollution have left low-income communities with higher energy bills and worse air quality due to a disparity in excess to energy efficiency programs\" and called for safeguards to prevent the burden of decarbonization costs being passed onto tenants, noting that current laws allow landlords to pass building improvement costs onto tenants.\n\n'''Organics Recycling Ordinance'''\n\nTo comply with a Senate Bill 1383, adopted in 2016 as an effort to reduce emissions and which required organic waste to be reduced by 75% by 2025, the Los Angeles City Council passed a motion authored by Koretz aimed at expanding its residential organics collection program from the current 18,000 customers to 750,000 customers.\n\n'''Expanded Polystyrene ban ordinance'''\n\nKoretz introduced an ordinance, with Councilmember O'Farrell, calling for a ban on expanded polystyrene also known by its trade name Styrofoam as it is “toxic from production to usage to landfill.”  The ordinance prohibits the sale and distribution of expanded polystyrene products for businesses with more than 26 employees beginning in April 2023, and for smaller businesses in April 2024. Koretz stated in council pointing to a Styrofoam cup with a chasing symbol on the back, said that the symbol implies the cup is recyclable. \"But it's not,\" Koretz said. \"It will never happen. This cup will never be recycled. It is chasing into a landfill. It's being chased into an ocean. It's being chased into rivers. But this will never be chased into a recycling plant.\"\n\n'''Healthy Soils/Regenerate LA'''\n\nFollowing the release of the , Koretz and Councilmember Mike Bonin put forward a motion, approved by Council, institutionalizing the Regenerate LA healthy soils initiative. The legislative action will help to “drawdown,” or pull greenhouse gases from the atmosphere through a holistic, comprehensive effort by using the city's annual estimated 280,000 tons of food waste to build healthy soils on parklands and open space.\n\n'''LA City Biodiversity Index'''\n\nIn 2017, the City Council adopted a motion introduced by Koretz that directed the city's Department of Sanitation and Environment to develop a customized biodiversity index. Said Koretz: “The creation of this groundbreaking L.A. City Biodiversity Index is the next important step toward the comprehensive, holistic wildlife and habitat protection ... [using] evidenced-based science to create policies that emphasize and encourage the interconnectedness of healthy ecosystems and healthy people across L.A. as we move forward into an uncertain climate-changed future.'' \n\n'''Bike-friendly Infrastructure'''\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Koretz blocked efforts to build a bikeway network on Westwood Blvd in . Koretz claimed that the bike lanes would be dangerous and would increase traffic by taking the place of parking spaces and turning lanes. For safety purposes, Koretz proposed moving the bike lane one block to the west to less-trafficked Gayley Avenue.\n\nKoretz blocked the provision of $50 million in State dollars for the \"Uplift Melrose\" project, a plan to revitalize  which would reduce Melrose to one lane in either direction with no left turns. The plan included raised crossroads; bus lanes and covered bus stops; increased tree canopy cover Melrose; and separated bike lanes. Koretz, however, stated concerns regarding traffic back ups in both directions. He also said in a letter that the plan would impact emergency responders, but was accused of ism by critics.\n\n\nIn 2019, Koretz opposed , a zoning reform bill which would allow for dense housing near rail stations, major bus routes and areas with high concentrations of jobs. Koretz called the bill a \"handout for developers\" and said that more housing supply would destroy historic districts, destroy single-family neighborhoods, and displace renters.\n\n\nA long-time supporter of the labor movement, in 2014, Koretz with Councilmember Cedillo introduced a wage-theft motion, approved by Council, to criminalize wage theft and increase penalties and fines on employers who unfairly cheat their employees out of pay. Koretz argued that this ordinance would give Angelenos another tool to battle wage theft, ensuring that workers get the money they deserve and leveling the playing field for businesses that follow the rules.  During the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021, Koretz and Councilmen Marqueece Harris-Dawson authored the Hero Pay legislation which required large grocery and pharmacy retailers to offer employees an additional $5 per hour in hazard pay. The motion is designed to also help shape future legislative policy regarding worker protections, essential services in neglected communities and strategies to address \"food deserts.''\n\n\nWith the goal to keep young people safe in high schools, Koretz helped the  secure a grant from the federal government to develop a security program in Los Angeles high schools.  In April 2022, the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition filed a lawsuit over Paul Koretz's failure to respond to a public records request regarding his communications with the Simon Wiesenthal Center about this security program. Koretz responded by saying his office was overwhelmed with record requests and needed more time. The records were sent 14 months later, on the day of the lawsuit's filing.\n\n\nFollowing ongoing disruptions and protests of council meetings which began after the , Koretz ended his final speech as a member of the City Council with explicit language directed at activists by appropriating a quote heard hundreds of times from them during city meetings held by video. He received applause and a standing ovation by fellow Councilmembers, staffers, and members of the attending public, though he was criticized for his language by some commentators and constituents on social media.\n\n\n\nPaul Koretz announced his candidacy for  in January 2020. Koretz faced criticism when a Commissioner of the  held a fundraiser for Koretz's campaign for City Controller.\n\nPaul Koretz advanced to the general election after placing 2nd place in the primary election with 23.67% of the vote. He was defeated in the general election by Certified Public Accountant and activist , 60.8% to 39.2%. Paul Koretz conceded on Nov 9, 2022.\n\n\nKoretz's wife, Gail, served as local government liaison for the office of Los Angeles Mayor . They have one child, Rachel. The Koretz family resides in the Beverly- of Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Grove became interested in the issue after learning about \"abuse, neglect and lack of supervision\" leading to 13 deaths at the centers, reported in an investigation by  in 2013. Grove has introduced legislation to close the centers and shifting the developmentally disabled residents to nonprofit community-based care, which Grove argues will be cheaper and have stronger oversight than institutional settings. Grove's legislation was opposed by family members of center residents (who say that forcing their loved ones to move would be disruptive), and by center employees (who note that state-run centers are more expensive because they offer more comprehensive services than community-based nonprofits, and that the rate of abuse in community settings is unclear because of looser reporting requirements for abuse in such settings). Grove supports increased funding for developmental disability services, saying: \"Now we're in a critical crisis stage where programs are closing.\"\n\n\nIn 2011, as a first-term assemblywoman, Grove advocated changing the  from a full-time to a part-time body.

According to Sanchez, \"With this change, we not only provide needed funds to help regions prepare for attacks, we also give them critical tips and best practices to help them respond.\"\n\nThe second bill, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016, H.R. 5459, \"clarifies that DHS grants for states and urban areas can be used for similar statewide initiatives.\" Sanchez's new amendment will increase the use of DHS grants in focusing on identifying threats and improving \"cybersecurity sharing dissemination.\" According to Sanchez, \"Given our increased reliance on cyber technology for commerce and critical infrastructure, and given the increasing sophistication of hackers who would do us harm, we must improve our efforts to identify, neutralize, and prevent cyberattacks.\"\n\n\nIn 2009, Loretta Sanchez secured $49.7 million in federal funding for critical water projects in Orange County, including local dam building, water treatment, and conservation projects:\n\n$49,310,000 for the continuing construction of the Santa Ana River Mainstem Project, including the Prado Dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers labeled the Santa Ana River the worst flood threat west of the Mississippi River. Federal funding allowed for the construction of a new dam to help mitigate this threat, as well as the potential environmental impact imposed by the dam.\n\n$2.870,000 for the Upper Newport Bay Ecosystem Restoration – Funding for this initiative helped manage sedimentation in the Upper Newport Bay by increasing the capacity of sediment basins, restoring and enhancing estuarine habitats, and improving educational and recreational opportunities.\n\n$426,000 for the Westminster-East Garden Grove Watershed Study in Santa Ana to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers undertake a comprehensive study of the Westminster Watershed, to develop a rehabilitation plan for flood control, ecosystem restoration, recreation, and water quality solutions, including the East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Channel and the Bolsa Chica Flood Control Channel. This study helped bolster flood control efforts currently in place, and assisted with ecosystem restoration and overall water quality standards. Both projects were consistent with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' flood control and environmental restoration missions in Southern California.\n\n$558,000 for the Orange Country Regional Water Reclamation Project – Also known as the Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS), this project was a water supply initiative designed to reuse approximately 140,000 acre-feet of treated and recycled waste water every year.\n\n$860,000 for the Westminster/East Garden Grove Watershed Study – Funding helped the Army Corps of Engineers continue its comprehensive study of the Westminster Watershed\n\n$546,000 for the Surfside-Sunset and Newport Beaches – Funding helped mitigate damage along 17 miles of the Orange County coastline that was caused by the construction of federal navigation and flood control works in Long Beach and Anaheim Bay.\n\n$369,000 for a Feasibility Study on the Aliso Creek Mainstem Project – Funding for the project helped to develop a plan to create stable flood plain areas and regenerate native riparian habitats, which resulted in cooler water and improved fish health.\n\n\n\n\n]]\nSanchez changed her party affiliation from Republican to Democratic in 1992, ahead of a 1994 campaign for Anaheim City Council. She ran under her married name Loretta Sanchez Brixey, but later dropped her married name because she believed that she and her seven brothers and sisters were better known in the community as the Sanchez family.\n\n\nIn 1996, Sanchez ran for the  in  against six-term Republican incumbent . The bitterly fought race saw Sanchez charge that Dornan was out of touch with his constituency, especially after a distracting run for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. The 46th and its predecessors had always had a Democratic tilt, but became even more Democratic after the 1990 census when it absorbed a considerably larger number of s than had previously been in the district. Sanchez won by 984 votes, and Dornan contested the election, alleging that many votes were cast by people who were not American citizens. \nA 16-month Congressional investigation found some evidence that 624 votes were indeed cast illegally (of which 84 votes were cast by newly naturalized citizens on the actual date of the election who had registered before their naturalization, which is not allowed under California law). An additional 124 flawed absentee votes had already been thrown out by California officials.\n\nIn consultation with the , the House investigative panel began with an INS name-matching list of 4,329 individuals with entries in INS computer records, compared to the voter rolls in the 46th Congressional District; and proceeded to use other government records, including claims of non-citizenship to be excused from jury duty, ultimately arriving at a list of 7,841 \"suspicious\" votes.  California's Secretary of State and the Orange County District Attorney also investigated a voter-registration group, Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and other alleged voter fraud in Orange County.  Local investigators, and eventually the Los Angeles Times, confirmed that Hermandad, an immigration and naturalization service still very active today in both Texas and California, had helped 172 register to vote before their naturalization, under the erroneous belief by some of its employees that as long as someone was naturalized before the date of the election, this was lawful.  The Orange County D.A. attempted to indict two employees of the organization, but when a grand jury declined to go along, the local investigation was dropped.\n\nIn February 1998 the House Committee on Oversight voted 8–1 to dismiss the matter, ending its investigation.  As Federal law required a proportional reduction of vote totals for each candidate, there being no means of determining just which candidate an illegal (or suspected illegal) voter had actually voted for, it was clear the result of the disputed election would not change even if the probe had continued.\n\nThe acrimonious disputes between Republicans and Democrats throughout the investigation and a desire not to alienate voters of Hispanic/Latin descent in the forthcoming congressional elections by GOP leaders also seem to have played a role, along with former Rep. Dornan's rather abrasive personal style, which the House in general had grown tired of.\n\nIndeed, the supposed total of 624 'illegal' votes was bitterly disputed by the Democratic minority, which argued that the investigation had never actually proved that many of the identified voters were in fact non-citizens; indeed asserting that between one quarter to even one half of \"illegal\" voters \"were U.S. citizens at the time they voted in the 1996 election,\" although they registered to vote in advance of being sworn in as U.S. Citizens.  And that in fact the Oversight Committee's suspected illegal voter list still \"contain[ed] a significant number of names whose Orange County Voter Records indicate that they were born in the United States....\" Despite the lengthy investigation, definitive proof of citizen or non-citizen status, and proof that the actual person still on the suspect voter list was actually the same individual whose name appeared in INS records was lacking for many of the 540 remaining voters, once those determined to have registered too early, before naturalization, were subtracted.\n\nSanchez became the first member of Congress of Mexican heritage to represent  and was re-elected.\n\n\nIn a 1998 rematch, she easily defeated Dornan and would not face another serious contest in a congressional election. Her district was made even safer after the , when it was renumbered as the 47th District and reconfigured as a Latino-majority district. During that  process, Sanchez hired  Michael S. Berman, brother of California Democratic Congressman , for \"redistricting consulting\" on her behalf. She paid Berman $20,000 for his work.Haberman, Maggie (2011-03-03)  , ''''\n\nIn 2006, she defeated Tan D. Nguyen () with 62% of the vote.\n\n\n\nDuring California's 2003 gubernatorial recall election, Sanchez was one of the first Democrats to break from   and state that a Democrat should run to succeed Davis in case the recall measure passed. Though she recommended that the Democratic candidate be California's  , Sanchez stated that if no other serious Democratic contender stepped forward, she would be willing to run herself. Many California Democrats ultimately adopted Sanchez's position, paving the way for   to enter the race.\n\n\n\nSanchez won against Republican nominee Rosemarie Avila and American Independent Robert Lauten.\n\n\n\nSanchez considered running for governor and for the , but declined to enter  after former governor  declared his candidacy and deferred to incumbent senator , who .\n\nSanchez was challenged by Republican nominee  and independent candidate Ceci Iglesias. According to ''Roll Call'', Sanchez considered running for governor or for the U.S. Senate in 2010. In November 2005, she opened an  called People for Loretta 2010. However, in June 2009, she announced she would run for reelection to the House.\n\nIn September 2010, Loretta Sanchez appeared on the Spanish language network,  and said that \"the Vietnamese and the Republicans are – with an intensity – trying to take away 'our' seat\", referring to her Vietnamese-born opponent, .(9/24/10)  FoxNews.com Retrieved September 25, 2010. Sanchez also described Tran as \"anti-immigrant\".\n\n\nIn September, 2011 Sanchez's campaign treasurer, Kinde Durkee, was arrested on suspicion of mail fraud. Sanchez and several others of Durkee's clients found their campaign funds wiped out. Sanchez's chief of staff, Adrienne Elrod, remarked that \"Kinde was someone whose services and counsel we trusted for many years.

McKeon was named chairman of the Committee on Armed Services in January, following the Republican takeover of the House in the November 2010 elections.\n\nAs a member of the House, he made education and defense issues two of his main priorities. He was greatly involved in the reform of the Student Loan Aid Program, which reduced interest rates but controversially increased federal control over education policy, such as teacher training.

McKeon was thus the first congressman to represent the new district.\n\nIn the 2002 reapportionment, the San Fernando Valley and portions of the Antelope Valley were removed from the 25th District.

Republicans to wield power in new Congress\". Associated Press State and Local Wire, 17 November 2010. Accessed Online.\n\nMcKeon voted in favor of American military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Barack Obama's Afghanistan \"surge\" strategy, and has voted for increasing money and supplies to troops there. He has gone on record saying that withdrawal from Afghanistan should be conditions-based, and done with full consultation with senior military leadership. In a statement from May 2010, McKeon outlined his personal philosophy on the role of the United States and its military, calling for a return to \"peace through strength\" and Reagan-esque policies, including full financial and material support for the military in its current wars, keeping Guantanamo Bay open, and military posturing.\n\nIn a speech before the Foreign Policy Initiative research group in 2010, McKeon called for increases in government spending on defense above Obama's budgets. He has also called on Congress to \"embrace and build on\"  to find $100 billion in savings in the defense budget.\n\nIn 2011 McKeon organized a fundraiser for the \"Lucky 13\" Republican freshmen on the House Armed Services Committee to get contributions from defense contractor political action committees.\n\nIn 2011, McKeon proposed Section 1034, an amendment to the  that would have inserted the language \"Congress affirms that ... the President has the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force during the current armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces pursuant to\" the  (AUMF Against Terrorists) (Public Law 107–40) and stated that \"the current armed conflict includes nations, organization, and persons who (A) are part of, or are substantially supporting, al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; or (B) have engaged in hostilities or have directly supported hostilities in aid of a nation, organization, or person described in subparagraph (A).\", , ''Lawfare'' (May 10, 2011). McKeon also offered an NDAA proposal that \"contained a provision designed to require military detention of terrorism suspects, even those arrested domestically and even those who are U.S. citizens,\" but this was later watered down to a proposal stating that the president, under the AUMF Against Terrorists, had \"the authority to detain belligerents...until the termination of hostilities. President Obama did not request that this language be included, and in a statement the White House issued a  threat and said \"The Administration strongly objects to section 1034 which, in purporting to affirm the conflict, would effectively recharacterize its scope and would risk creating confusion regarding applicable standards.\"Christopher Anders, , American Civil Liberties Union (May 24, 2011). The expansive language of Section 1034 was criticized in a '''' editorial, which called it an unnecessary and dangerous proposal and said that it was \"wildly expansive authorization would, in essence, make the war on terror a permanent and limitless aspect of life on earth, along with its huge potential for abuse.\" The  also criticized McKeon's proposal. U.S. Representative  (Republican of Michigan) and Representative  (Democrat of California) offered an amendment that would remove McKeon's Section 1034 (the \"so-called 'endless war'\" provision) from the NDAA bill. The House rejected the Amash-Lee amendment by a 234–187, with most Democrats voting in favor and most Republicans voting against. President Obama ultimately signed the 2012 NDAA with the contentious provisions, but in February 2012, issued a set of broad waivers that allowed U.S. law enforcement agencies \"to retain custody of al-Qaeda terrorism suspects rather than turn them over to the military\" as contemplated by the NDAA.  said that Obama's waiver was \"essentially a 3,450-word line-item veto, rendering the mandatory military detention provision mostly moot.\"\n\nMcKeon said if forced to choose between tax increases and cuts to the Pentagon budget, he would choose tax increases. However he would prefer to cut  instead.

Hunter himself insisted that he never used campaign funds for personal expenses and that the indictment was a \"witch hunt\" carried out by \"partisan Democrat prosecutors\" and the \"\". The ''Union-Tribune'' pointed out that the local U.S. Attorney's office is led by , a Trump administration appointee.\n\n\n\nOn August 23, 2018, both Hunter and his wife pleaded not guilty to all charges. The two entered and left the courtroom separately, and were represented by separate counsel. Hunter suggested his wife was to blame for any irregularities, saying that she handled all their personal and campaign finances and adding, \"I didn't do it. I didn't spend any money illegally.\"\n\nOn June 24, 2019, federal prosecutors submitted a court filing alleging that Hunter used his campaign funds for extramarital affairs with five women, including three lobbyists, a congressional aide, and one of his staffers  between 2009 and 2016. Ahead of a court hearing in November 2019, Hunter expressed support for President 's downward sentence modification for convicted war criminal , but refused to answer reporters' questions about his case.\n\nOn December 3, 2019, Hunter pleaded guilty to one count of misusing campaign funds. Hunter said he expected to be sentenced to prison time, but hoped the judge would not sentence his wife to incarceration. On March 17, 2020, U.S. District Judge  sentenced Hunter to eleven months in prison, followed by three months of supervised release. Whelan rejected Hunter's request to serve most or all of his sentence on , given the long duration of his criminal conduct and the amount of money misappropriated.\n\nMargaret Hunter pleaded guilty to one count of corruption on June 13, 2019. She acknowledged that she had conspired with her husband to spend more than $200,000 in campaign funds on personal expenses. She agreed to give testimony and cooperate with the prosecution. Her  could have sent her to prison for up to five years. After a postponement due to the , she was sentenced to eight months home confinement and three years probation in August 2020.\n\nDuncan Hunter was scheduled to begin his prison sentence on January 4, 2021. However, he did not serve his sentence, because both he and Margaret were pardoned by then-president  in December 2020.\n\n\nOn December 5, 2019, the House Ethics Committee informed Hunter that he had violated House rules when he cast votes in the chamber two days earlier. They said he must refrain from Congressional voting because he had pleaded guilty to a federal felony with a potentially significant prison sentence. Longstanding precedent holds that House members convicted of felonies should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the Ethics Committee reviews the matter. Although there is no  rule barring a convicted felon from voting, the convicted member's party leadership usually strongly discourages a member from doing so, and the Ethics Committee has indicated in the past that convicted felons can be disciplined if they do take part in committee or floor votes.\n\nOn December 6, 2019, Hunter announced that he would resign from Congress after the . By waiting until January to resign, Hunter would receive at least an additional $10,000 in monthly salary. On January 7, 2020, he submitted his letters of resignation, effective January 13, to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Governor .\n\nIn January 2020, Democratic Representatives  (California) and  (New York) introduced the No Pensions for Corrupt Politicians Act of 2020, which would prevent Hunter and other members of Congress who commit or conspire to commit campaign finance crimes from collecting a . It is estimated that otherwise Hunter would have received an annual payment of at least $32,000 in a congressional pension, which he would have been able to begin accessing when he turned 62.\n\nThe following month, in February 2020,  published an investigative report, based on leaks of confidential documents, that implicated Hunter as a key figure in the prosecution of Greek Orthodox priest and hedge fund manager . The outlet noted Hunter's involvement in ''SEC vs. Lemelson'' as \"a glimpse of how companies try to get regulators to go after their short-selling enemies.\" U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell noted that the SEC had been urged to investigate Lemelson in a letter from Hunter, stating the court found enough facts to warrant discovery on Lemelson's claim of selective enforcement and bias.\n\nNewsom's office stated that there would be no special election to fill Hunter's congressional seat, and so it remained vacant until it was filled in the November 2020 election., , Julie Watson and NBC 7 Staff January 7, 2020. Retrieved January 10, 2020.\n\n\n\nHunter was scheduled to report to the , , in January 2021. However, on December 22, 2020, President   Hunter, as well as  of New York, another Republican congressman convicted of corruption, and commuted the sentence of  of Texas. The following day, Trump pardoned Hunter's estranged wife Margaret. In 2022, the fines for both were upheld, however, since the Federal Election Commission determined that the pardon did not cover the civil liability.\n\n\nIn 1998 Hunter married Polish-born Margaret Elizabeth Jankowski, whom he had met in 1992. They have three children. In 2016, Hunter sold his home in , and used part of the proceeds to repay his political campaign for some of the money he had spent on personal expenses. He and his family moved in with his father, . In August 2020, Margaret Hunter pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds for personal use and was sentenced to eight months of home confinement and three years of probation.

In 1988, he was chosen to serve on the senior staff of Governor Deukmejian. Poochigian served as the Chief Deputy Appointments Secretary, assisting the Governor in the selection of key administration officials and members of over 375 state boards and commissions.\n\n\nIn 1991, Governor  named him the Appointments Secretary.

Additionally, he served as the Assembly's representative on California's Little Hoover Commission, having been appointed by both Republican and Democratic Speakers of the Assembly.\n\nIn 1996, the ''California Journal'' named him the Republican \"Rookie of the Year\" (out of a class of 22).  The ''Journal'' also rated him among the top 5 legislators in the 80-member State Assembly in the following separate categories: Effectiveness, Integrity, Intelligence, Problem-solving, Potential, and Overall.

On September 24, 2009, Poochigian was unanimously confirmed to the court by California's Commission on Judicial Appointments, consisting in this case of Chief Justice , Fifth District Presiding Justice , and Attorney General Brown.  At the confirmation hearing, Chief Justice George \"ripped into the commission that rated [Poochigian] \"not qualified\" for the post,\" noting that there was a \"real problem in the process\" used by the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation, and strongly urging that there be \"some revisions in the procedure.\"  Chief Justice George and Justice Ardaiz criticized the JNE commission for disregarding its own standards and the statutory standards that are supposed to govern its processes.\n\nStill, Poochigian's appointment was not without controversy.  JNE Commission Chair Jonathan Wolf of San Francisco wrote to the Chief Justice that Poochigian “is intelligent, diligent, and articulate...and is committed to public service” but continued that in the Commission's view \"Poochigian’s legal background [did] not qualify him for the appellate bench.\"  In explaining the Commission's findings, Wolf continued, \"he [Poochigian] had not practiced law for approximately 21 years and had not litigated a case in approximately the same amount of time.

He attended Purche Avenue Elementary School, Henry Clay Junior High School and . Following high school, he attended  and , where he earned a  in  and certificate in .\n\nBradford was the first African American elected to the Gardena City Council, a post he held for over 12 years. He served one year as Mayor Pro Tem of the city.\n\nHe also worked twelve years as a public affairs executive at , seven years at , and four years as a program director at the Los Angeles Conservation Corps.\n\n\n\nBradford's time in the assembly has been marked by his chairmanship of the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Commerce, which has legislative jurisdiction over electricity, natural gas, telecommunications, private water corporations and other issues related to commerce. Actions taken in this committee affect California homeowners and businesses, the economy, jobs, and the environment.\n\nIn his role as chair, Bradford has garnered national attention presiding over important hearings investigating major power outages, and how federal, state, and local authorities might better respond to such events and prevent them from happening in the future. In October 2011, Bradford convened a joint legislative hearing with Assemblymember , chair of the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management, in San Diego to discuss the massive power outage that struck the Pacific Southwest region in September of that year.\n\nIn February 2012 Bradford and Lowenthal convened another hearing in  to investigate another major power outage that struck the Los Angeles area as a result of a massive windstorm.\n\nEarly in 2013, Assembly Speaker  named Bradford the Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color. The Select Committee is a bipartisan panel of legislators from around the state tasked with fact finding and making recommendations for addressing the issues facing young men in California, particularly black and Latino boys.\n\nIn February Bradford accepted an invitation to the White House to attend President 's announcement of \"My Brother's Keeper,\" a federal investment in the lives of boys and men of color. The program follows the work Bradford's Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color has done to give young men of color the tools they need to succeed, while dismantling systemic injustices that stand in the way of their success.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his management of the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Commerce, Bradford has also authored several pieces of legislation on energy and utilities.\n\nIn 2012 Governor  signed into law AB 1511, which requires property sellers to inform buyers of important information about natural gas pipelines near their homes. The law was authored in response to the deadly explosion of an underground pipeline in .\n\nBradford also authored AB 2201, which increases civil penalties on pipeline operators for safety violations. Bradford's bill brings the cap on penalties under California law into line with those under federal law: $200,000 per day, and a maximum of $2,000,000.\n\nBradford drew national attention for AB 2514, a bill requiring the California Public Utilities Commission to conduct a study examining the costs and benefits of California's net-energy metering (NEM) program. While NEM programs have helped develop solar power industries in countries around the world, Bradford believes they may shift costs unfairly onto homes without solar panels.\n\nBradford closed the 2013 legislative year having 11 bills signed into law by Governor  Among these were bills focused on public safety, solar energy, and criminal justice reform:\n\n* AB 128: Following a recommendation made by the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST), AB 128 reclassifies the Los Angeles World Airports police department under Penal Code 830.1. Officers with 830.1 status are considered full peace officers, equivalent to municipal police departments. Without 830.1 status, airport officers are prohibited from removing vehicles, seizing drugs or weapons, or other functions for which they may need to wait for backup to arrive. Bradford, whose district includes , introduced the bill ten years after the POST recommendation. Earlier versions of the bill died in the legislature.\n* AB 170: For purposes of obtaining an assault weapons permit, under current law a \"person\" is defined as an \"individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, or any other group or entity.\" AB 170 limits the definition of a person to an individual. \n* AB 217: Extends existing financial support for solar installations on low-income households. The California Solar Initiative (CSI) directs 10 percent of its funding to solar subsidies for low and very-low income households. AB 217 extends this component for another six years after the CSI sunsets. \n* AB 651: Gives judges more discretion to grant an expungement of a low-level offense when the offender has completed supervision, paid restitution, and demonstrated a commitment to reentry. \n* AB 721: Clarifies the existing drug trafficking statute, which allows prosecutors to add a felony transportation charge to a person found physically moving any amount of illegal drugs. AB 721 adds the words \"with the intent to sell\" to clarify the Legislature's intent to punish drug dealers. An individual may still be eligible for a drug possession charge, but prosecutors will now have to show an individual had the intent to sell in order to qualify for an additional trafficking charge. \n* AB 1371: The Three Feet for Safety Act establishes a minimum three-foot buffer around bicyclists on public roads in California. Motorists wishing to pass a cyclist must keep a distance of at least three feet, or slow to a safe and prudent speed if there is not enough room to give three feet. Bradford's version of the bill was the fifth attempt at a safe passing distance in California. Earlier versions died in the Legislature twice, and were twice vetoed by the Governor. The safe passing distance took effect September 16, 2014.\n\nBy the close of the 2014 legislative year, Bradford had sent 15 bills to the governor's desk. As of September 21, he had already signed AB 2634, which gives courts \"greater authority to issue injunctions against police departments that have a history of civil rights violations.\"\nStill awaiting gubernatorial action are bills including:\n* AB 2673: Sponsored by City Attorney Mike Feuer and endorsed by the '''', this bill eliminates \"the use of civil compromise in misdemeanor hit-and-run collisions that result in injury or death.\" Under current law, a hit-and-run driver may reach a civil compromiseusually a financial settlementand have criminal charges dropped. This bill ensures that hit-and-run drivers face criminal responsibility for their actions.\n*AB 1327: Jointly authored with Assembly Members Jeff Gorell and Bill Quirk, this bill establishes regulations for public agencies wishing to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles. Among those, agencies would need a warrant and to give public notice before deploying a drone; would be required to destroy any data and images collected from a drone within one year, unless part of an ongoing investigation; and would be expressly prohibited from arming a drone with weapons.

In January 2018, Baca switched his affiliation back to the , saying that \"in my heart, I've always been a Democrat with a 100 percent voting record for labor.\"\n\nPrior to his time in the House of Representatives, Baca served in the California Senate from 1998 to 1999, and the California State Assembly from 1992 to 1998.\n\nHe currently serves on the  City Council.\n\n\nBaca was born in  in 1947, the youngest of 15 children in a primarily Spanish-speaking household. His father was a railroad laborer. The family moved to  when Joe was young, where he shined shoes at age 10, delivered newspapers, and later worked as a laborer for the Santa Fe Railroad, until he was drafted in 1966, serving in the  until 1968. He did not serve in Vietnam.\n\nFollowing military service, Baca attended  and went on to receive his bachelor's degree in  from . He worked for 15 years in community relations with General Telephone and Electric. In 1979, he was the first Latino elected to the board of trustees for the San Bernardino Valley College District. He was elected to the  in 1992, and to the  in 1998.\n\n\n\n*''''''\n**\n**\n** (Ranking Member)\n*''''''\n**\n**\n\n\n*'''''' (Former Chairman)\n**Corporate America, Technology, Communications and the Arts Task Force (Chairman)\n*''''''\n\nHe served on the , where he was a member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises, and the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Rep. Baca also served on the , where he was the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Departmental Operations, Oversight, Nutrition and Forestry.\n\nRep. Baca was the Chair of the CHC Corporate America Task Force, which aims to increase Hispanic representation in corporate America. He created and co-chaired the Congressional Sex and Violence in the Media Caucus. Other caucus memberships included the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, the Military/ Veterans Caucus, the Native American Caucus and the U.S.-Mexico Caucus.\n\nIn 2011, Rep. Baca became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the .; GovTrack.us; The same year, he voted for the  as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.\n\nIn March 2012, Baca and Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) introduced a bill that would force video game companies to put warning labels on their products. H.R. 4204, the Violence in Video Games Labeling Act, would compel game companies to label their products with \"WARNING: Exposure to violent video games has been linked to aggressive behavior\". \n\n\n\n\nA few months after Baca was elected to the State Senate, Congressman  died after a long illness. Baca finished first in a seven-way primary, but fell far short of a majority due to the presence of two minor Democratic candidates. In the runoff, Baca defeated Republican Elia Pirozzi with 50.4%.\n\nBaca won a full term in 2000 with 59% of the vote. After the 2000 census, the district was renumbered as the 43rd and reconfigured as a majority-Hispanic district.  Baca was handily reelected from this redrawn district in 2002, and did not face another close contest again until 2012.\n\n\nAfter the , the  significantly redrew California's congressional map. The bulk of Baca's former territory became the 35th District, though his home in  was placed in the 31st District.  Baca opted to run in the 35th, and finished first in the all-party primary with 46.7 percent of the vote.  His nearest opponent, State Senator , took 34 percent.  In the general election, Negrete McLeod defeated Baca, taking 56 percent to Baca's 44 percent. A few weeks leading up to the election McLeod's campaign benefited from $3.2 million in independent expenditures from the Federal Super PAC of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who was Mayor of New York City at that time. The Super PAC ran negative advertisements in newspapers, radio, and television accusing Baca of being soft on crime and causing perchlorate water contamination in drinking water. Bloomberg had become unhappy with Baca because he had not been supportive of Bloomberg's efforts for stronger federal laws for gun control and the enactment of federal registration.\n\nBaca ran again, changing to the 31st District  but came fifth with 11.2%.\n\nIn 2014, Baca also ran for Mayor of Fontana. He lost in a landslide and subsequently announced his retirement from politics, but made a comeback to the  City Council in 2022.\n\n\nAccording to the '''', Baca, chairman of the , directed Caucus funds from its  BOLDPAC (Building Our Leadership Diversity) to the unsuccessful California campaigns of his sons, Joe Baca, Jr. and Jeremy Baca. At the time, Rep.   and five other members dropped out of the PAC in protest of these actions. They alleged that the funds, meant to elect Hispanic candidates, should not have been used to help Baca's sons run against Hispanic candidates and that in a previous race funded by the PAC, Joe Jr. had run against Hispanic candidates.\n\n (CREW) released a report stating that Rep. Baca had paid his daughter $27,000 from campaign funds and donated more than $20,000 to his sons' political campaigns from his own campaign funds. They reported accusations that were made in 2006 by former members of Baca's Washington staff that they were sent to California in 2004 for a staff retreat and pressured to work on Joe Baca, Jr.'s campaign for the state Assembly on their paid time for the senior Baca.\n\n\nIn January 2007, fellow Hispanic Caucus members including Loretta Sanchez, , , and  wrote a letter to Baca asking for a new election with a secret ballot. They claimed that Baca was elected chair of the Caucus in a public ballot, despite Caucus rules for electing a chair that require a secret ballot election.\n\nOn January 31, '''' reported that Rep. Baca had called Loretta Sanchez a \"whore\". Rep. Baca denied making the insult. Reps. Loretta Sanchez and Hilda Solis alleged Rep. Baca made the remark in the summer of 2006.\n\nCiting Baca's alleged insult and the perceived impropriety in Baca's election to chairman of the CHC, as well as Baca's treatment of Latina members in the CHC, Loretta Sanchez resigned from the Caucus along with her sister, three other female California members and one female member from Arizona.  The two congresswomen state that they heard the remark from unnamed sources, although ''The Politico'' identified California State Assemblyman  as one of those who heard the insult firsthand and told Loretta Sanchez. She said that Baca confirmed the comments to her sister Linda Sánchez the day before Loretta Sanchez confronted him over the accusation.\n\nIn a February, 2014 interview in '''', Baca described Representative , who had defeated him in the 2012 elections after receiving $3.2 million in help from then New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Super PAC in the final weeks leading up to the election, as \"some bimbo.\" Minutes later he apologized, saying he was upset because he felt it was a disservice to the voters that she had announced the day before that she would not seek re-election to the congressional seat after holding it for only two years.\n\n\nBaca and his wife, Barbara, began their own business, Interstate World Travel, in San Bernardino in 1989.

He helped fashion downtown Los Angeles into a major metropolitan center but was accused of turning his back on the people in his district who elected him to 27 years on the city's governing body from 1963 to 1990.\n\n\n in 1937.]]\nLindsay was born on November 29, 1900, in , where he worked in the cotton fields as a youth. He left Mississippi as a teenager and enrolled in a school in . He then moved to Arizona, where he joined the Army and served in the  and the . As part of an Army program, he studied  at the .  He moved to Los Angeles in 1923 or 1924 and became a  janitor with the . He took a civil service exam for a clerkship, and he was given a basement office because, he said, his superiors did not want him to sit with whites. He took classes in governmental administration and  at the University of Southern California and in business administration at UCLA during the 25 years he worked for the department.\n\nAbout his years as a janitor, the ''Los Angeles Times'' quoted him as saying, \"I used to scrub toilets for the city of Los Angeles with a mopthat was my job [...] I had the lowest job you can give a human being.\" but the ''Los Angeles Sentinel,'' a black-oriented newspaper, cited C. A. (Bob) Barker, a Los Angeles businessman, as saying, \"He was a helluva janitor! That was an important job for Negroes at that time. He gave the janitor's job the same respect he gave the council position. Whatever Gil was doing was very important to him.\"\n\nHe was known as being a short man, standing five feet, three inches tall.\n\nLindsay's wife, Theresa, was from . It was said that Lindsay \"began to decline mentally and physically\" after Theresa died in 1984; they had been married 49 years.  He had a son, Melvin; a daughter, Sylvia Thornton, a stepson, Herbert Howard, and an adopted daughter, Christina Willoughby.\n\n\n upon her arrival in Los Angeles in 1965.]]\nLindsay became involved in Democratic and labor politics and became so influential that his bosses in Water and Power \"called on him to turn out the black vote on various bond issues.\" He was on the board of directors of the  from 1953 to 1958 and was also an NAACP vice president. He was tapped by City Council candidate  as his aide to turn out the black vote. Hahn won and when he later became a  he appointed Lindsay as a field deputy, a job that Lindsay held for ten years, until 1963.\n\n\n\n\nLindsay became Los Angeles's first black council member at the age of 62 when, with the backing of the political Hahn brothers and he was appointed to a vacant 9th District Council seat in January 1963 after  won election to Congress. He won election in his own right later in the year and was reelected to eight successive terms. As the years passed, he proclaimed himself the \"Emperor of the Great 9th District.\" Lindsay's term of 27 years was surpassed only by those of   (30 years), , 31 years,  (32 years) and  (35 years).\n\n\n\n'''Developers.''' Over the years, Lindsay attracted criticism \"that he was too cozy with big developers, that he favored  and neglected the neighborhoods.\" He was often criticized for supporting Downtown \"at the expense of the southern portion of his district.\" But City News Service writer Cathy Franklin said of him: \"During his nearly three decades in office, the downtown area exploded into one of the premier business centers of the world.\"\n\n'''Blue lights.''' Lindsay clashed \"in a bitter personal exchange\" with Councilman  when the latter introduced a resolution aimed at removing the blue lights that Lindsay had had installed on the rear of his city automobile. Lindsay later agreed to remove the lights but said: \"The thing that disturbs me is that my colleagues equivocate over frivolous motions that amount to nothing. They gag at a gnat and swallow a camel.\"\n \n'''Morals.''' The 9th District councilman opined that  communities would \"not be having problems with topless-bottomless bars if moral levels matched those\" of his  and  district. \"We have clean-minded people and a clean district,\" he said. \"All this junk is out there where the affluent aristocrats, the holier-than-thou people live.\"\n\n'''Council members.''' Interviewed by ''Los Angeles Times'' reporter Janet Clayton for an article about relationships among City Council members, Lindsay noted in 1984 that \"All the council members get along fine when they need a vote. Otherwise, they can't stand each other, or I should say, don't genuinely like each other. They each have their own agenda, you know.\" He said  he has a \"simple formula\" for deciding issues: \"When I give my word on a vote, I haven't reneged, least not more than a half dozen times in 20 years. I vote my district, then my friends, and, what's good for me.\"\n\n'''Skid Row.''' The ''Times'' noted that Lindsay, \"whose district includes , has always favored upscale commercial and residential development in the area, the last big undeveloped stretch of downtown Los Angeles.\" In 1987 the councilman, along with a group of business owners objected to putting more residential and treatment centers in Skid Row on the grounds they were \"drawing the homeless, including the mentally ill\" to an area that had \"great potential for commercial growth.\"\n\n\n\nIn April 1992, a  jury ruled that Juanda Chauncie, Lindsay's 40-year-old girlfriend, had taken advantage of the councilman to gain control of his money and property. The five-woman, seven-man panel ruled that Chauncie had used undue influence over him and awarded $235,000 to Lindsay's stepson and estate. Attorney 's firm represented the estate.\n\n\n\nLindsay suffered a stroke in 1989 that reduced him simply to being the \"titular leader\" of the 9th District, with much of the real power in the hands of Bob Gay, his chief assistant, the ''Downtown News'' reported. \"On the Council floor, he has had moments of confusion, and been both humored and manipulated by the other councilmembers. Those who deal with him say that he has moments of tremendous clarity, but that he is largely removed from the day-to-day workings of the office.\" Lindsay had lost \"some control of his hands and has had trouble writing.\" City Council President  said that Lindsay had \"deteriorated to the point where he was incapable of doing his job.\" Lindsay  was sent to a hospital again when, in the midst of the excitement occasioned by a planned visit to City Hall by South African anti-apartheid leader , he forgot to take his diabetes medicine and collapsed.\n\nHe was brought to a hospital in , where he remained until his fellow City Council members talked about removing him from his Council seat because he had been outside the Los Angeles city limits for more than 90 days. He was then transferred to \"another facility within Los Angeles to make him less vulnerable to efforts to unseat him.\"\n\nBy then in his 28th year as a City Council member, Lindsay died in a Hollywood hospital December 28, 1990, \"as a result of a long illness which began with a severe stroke in early September that left him paralyzed on the right side and unable to speak and, at the end, was complicated by a heart attack.\" A funeral service was held at Victory Baptist Church, and he was buried in . Lindsay was a member of People's Baptist Church.\n\n\n\n Towers]]\n\n*  The Gilbert W.

Bates is married to , another former mayor of Berkeley and State Assembly member who served in the California State Senate. He is a graduate of the  and was a member of the '  team. Bates was a captain in the  after graduating from college and served in Germany. He worked in real estate before serving on the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and in the state legislature.\n\n\nBates was the youngest elected Supervisor in Alameda County history at the age of 34 and the first full-time Supervisor from 1971 to 1976. During his term Alameda County gave the highest percentage of its Community Revenue Sharing money to community-based programs. The following programs were funded: Asian Health Center, Asian Mental Health Center, Clínica de la Raza, East Oakland Health Clinic, Over 60 Clinic, Center for Independence Living, Bonita House, Berkeley Place, Berkeley Battered Women's Shelter, Filipinos for Affirmative Action, Berkeley-Oakland Support Services, Pro Arts, Berkeley Youth Alternatives, Berkeley Free Clinic, Pacific Center, Creative Growth Center, Bananas, Berkeley Women's Health Center, Berkeley Rape Crisis Center, and West Oakland Health Center. The County also enacted a 100-acre minimum zoning law to protect agricultural open space.\n\n\n\nBates served in the California State Assembly representing the  (the ) from 1977 to 1993 and the 14th District from 1993 to 1997. During those years he was known as one of the legislature's most liberal members. Under Republican governors, Bates authored over 220 bills that became law, including the creation of the East Bay Shoreline State Park, a number of progressive social policy laws including the Community Residential Treatment legislation (\"the Bates Bill\"), and the founding of the first Community Bank in the Bay Area. Bates authored the first legislation in the country allowing \"brew pubs\", establishments that brew their own beer for sales on and off the premises and are typically combined with a restaurant.\n\nAfter retiring from the Assembly in 1996, Bates taught at UC Berkeley and worked to ensure healthier foods in the Oakland and Berkeley school districts. In 2002 Bates was drafted out of retirement to challenge the two-term incumbent mayor of Berkeley, . He won the race with 55% of the vote.\n\n\nBates personally stole approximately 200 copies of '''' on the day before the 2002 Berkeley mayoral election after the student-run campus newspaper endorsed his opponent, then-Mayor Shirley Dean. He won the election the next day. Bates acknowledged taking the papers and wasn't charged but voluntarily donated $500 to the Daily Cal. Following his election, Bates led the city council in passing an ordinance that outlawed the stealing of free newspapers and gave a series of talks discussing his mistakes and what he learned from them. Four years later the California legislature passed a similar law that applies statewide.\n\nHousing and urban development were major issues throughout Bates's tenure as mayor. His success in promoting an environmental agenda as a member the California Assembly led him to partner with environmental groups like the Sierra Club in promoting a series of \"Smart Growth\" policies for Berkeley and the Bay Area. In addition to advocating dense, transit-oriented urban development, Bates worked to mitigate the effects of Berkeley's rapidly rising housing costs on the city's low-income residents. He proposed a municipal density bonus program to incentivize the inclusion of affordable units in new developments and increase the fees that developers must pay into the city's Housing Trust Fund. Bates also put up resistance to UC Berkeley's expansion. In 2004, following the release of UC's Long-Range Development Plan, he promised to fight the expansion \"tooth and nail.\" Saying \"the university asked us to sign the equivalent of a blank check,\" Bates announced that the city would file a $4.1 million lawsuit against the university. After a year of negotiations in which the university agreed to increase its ongoing fiscal support for city services, the lawsuit was settled for $1.2 million.\n\nIn 2004 Berkeley voters approved Measure I, amending the city's charter to change the date of mayoral elections to coincide with presidential elections and to adjust the mayor's 2006 term to two years on a one-time basis to accomplish this result. Therefore the next mayoral election took place in 2008.In 2006 Bates won reelection in a landslide, defeating former City Planning Commissioner Zelda Bronstein 63% to 31%, the largest margin of victory in a Berkeley mayor's race since 1967. (Native American and community activist Zachary Runningwolf and Christian Pecaut won 5% and 1%, respectively.)\n\nIn January 2008 Berkeley drew national attention when the city council passed a motion to send a letter to the  to tell them they were \"unwelcome intruders.\" Bates voted to approve the motion. He voted to amend the letter on February 12 to remove language like \"unwelcome intruder\". On February 13, 2008, Bates said: \"I think it stands [that] we didn't want them here and they came here. And [they are] unwelcome. You know, we'd like them to leave voluntarily. So I don't think an apology is in order.\"\n\nIn November 2008 Bates was reelected to a third term by a large margin, defeating former mayor Shirley Dean 61% to 36% (two official write-in candidates won 3% collectively.) In 2009 Bates appeared in the documentary film ''.'' The film is centered around the implementation of Measure G , The Green Measure, meant to help Berkeley lead the nation to a more environmentally friendly future. The film played in Berkeley and is scheduled for a New York release in February 2023 in an effort to promote a staged version.\n\nIn 2012 Bates was reelected to a fourth term with 55% of the vote, defeating opponents including , poet Mark Schwartz, and Jacquelyn McCormick.\n\nIn 2014 Bates placed on the ballot the Downtown Development Plan, which passed by 62% and established transit-oriented development downtown.\n\nIn June 2015 Bates was at the focal point of the Berkeley Balcony Collapse tragedy, which claimed the lives of 5 young Irish J1 students and an Irish-American student. Bates was praised by the Irish media for the sensitivity and consideration he showed and the support he gave to the Irish J1 community and the victims' families. He promised a wide-ranging investigating into the cause of the accident. Considered the likeliest cause was that the balcony was not constructed properly, leading to dry rot, leading to the balcony becoming structurally compromised.\n\nBates was the longest-serving mayor in Berkeley's history, serving 14 years. During his mayoralty, the city built the David Brower Center, the Center for Independent Living building \"Ed Roberts Campus\", the YMCA Youth Center and the 5 City \"Tom Bates Sports Facility\". He also served on the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Bay Conservation Commission and Development Board and Bay Area Air Pollution Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Kuehl was California's first openly gay state legislator, having previously served in the  and the , where she was the Assembly's first female speaker pro tem.\n\n\nKuehl was born Sheila Ann Kuehl in . Her father, Arthur, was an airplane construction worker at Douglas Aircraft. He was Catholic and her mother, Lillian, was Jewish. As a child actress, Kuehl performed under the stage name Sheila James.\n\nAt age seven, Kuehl began to take tap dancing lessons. In one recital, Kuehl played an assistant in a skit called \"The Old Sleuth\" where she sat under a table listening for clues. To indicate she was listening, Kuehl made faces, which caused the audience to laugh and encouraged her to make more faces, resulting in more laughter. The skit was ruined, but the drama teacher, Mrs. Meglin, was impressed. Kuehl later recalled that Meglin told her mother, 'The kid's pretty funny. Can she read?' And my mother said, 'Oh, yeah, she can read, she skipped two grades, she's really very good.' Mrs. Meglin said, 'There's a radio series holding interviews...at an agent's office on Sunset Boulevard. Would you be interested in taking her to the interview? All she has to do is read...'\nSo we went for the interview and there were like 150 or 200 kids there and all you did was read. And I was called back...and eventually I got the part in what probably was the last family radio series before it went all music and news...'\"\n\n\n\nHaving landed the role at the age of eight, Kuehl (billed as Sheila James) starred with radio and film veterans , , , and  on the family radio program ''The Penny Williamson Show'' airing live from Studio B of the NBC studios in Hollywood. Airing in the adjacent studios were the popular drama '''' and '''' with  (whom Kuehl admired). Kuehl would later cite her interaction with the other NBC radio talent as influential in forming her professionalism and comedy skills. The show centered around Singleton playing Penny Williamson, a widow selling real estate in a small town to support two daughters (played by Kuehl and ). The show was \"a light-hearted pitch for women's liberation, portraying Penny and her daughters as highly competent, self-sufficient females\" dealing with bungling suitors competing for Penny's affections.\n\n\nDue to her radio talent, Kuehl's agent convinced her parents to take her to auditions for a television role. Kuehl was signed to play Jackie, 's  daughter, in the television series '''' (also known as ''Trouble with Father''), which ran from 1950 to 1955. Kuehl later recalled \"The same 200 kids I think were there for the interview [as had been for the radio audition] and I was called back and called back and called back and eventually I got that part. And beginning in 1950, I did that series for six years.\"\n\nAfter ''The Stu Erwin Show'' ended, Kuehl continued to work as an actress while going to school.  Her academic success allowed her to skip two grades; by sixteen she was attending the . As her college studies continued she moved into a sorority house and began spending summers as a counsellor for a children's camp. At the age of eighteen, while working at the camp, Kuehl met a twenty-one year-old counsellor named Kathy and fell in love. Kuehl would later recall \"It was just a funny attraction that neither of us would acknowledge. Then, one night she and I were sitting together at her place. She was rubbing my back and we just, like, went to bed. It was wonderful. But then we stayed up all night wondering if we were really sick.\" They concluded that they were \"sick\" but that nothing could be done. Kuehl later recalled \"There was no movement then. There was nothing to read. I knew no lesbians. We just figured this was a rare thing and that we were two women who'd fallen in love and that we had to keep it a secret because nobody would approve. We didn't dare tell a soul.\" After that summer, with Kathy going to school in San Diego, the two exchanged passionate letters daily for a year.\n\n\nDuring this time, Kuehl began acting the role for which she is probably best known – her portrayal of teen-aged genius , the would-be girlfriend of the title character in the television series '''', which aired on  from 1959 to 1963. Zelda was originally intended to be a one-shot character in the early ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"Love is a Science,\" but ''Dobie'' creator  liked Kuehl and had her signed on as a semiregular cast member.\n\nKuehl later recalled how she landed the part. \"Well, when you're an actor with an agent, no matter how old you are, you go on interviews. I went on lots of interviews for lots of guest shots…and I had done two [episodes] on ''Love that Bob'' [''''] with Bob Cummings and Dwayne Hickman, who played his nephew, and the director Rod Amateau, so I had met all the people who eventually were going to be much of the team for ''Dobie Gillis''. In 1959, I was at UCLA, and I went on an interview for ''Dobie Gillis'' and I walked on the set and they all said, 'Oh, hi, we know your work, you're fine. Just go across the street and meet Max Schulman [the writer director].' As it turned out, Max and I were the same height, and he was like buried behind the desk when I walked in. And he said, 'What's the first line?' And I said, 'I love you.' And he said, 'You're hired!'\"\n\nSigning a contract with ''Dobie'' producer  required Kuehl, then 18 and in college studying theater, to change her major to English, so that Shulman, also a successful author, could act as her  on set to allow her to continue her studies. Kuehl earned a bachelor's degree in English from the  in 1962, during the show's final season.\n\nHaving signed a contract in 1960 to do 21 shows for the next season of ''Dobie'', that same year Kuehl was elected an officer in both the university student government and in her sorority. Despite this success, things became difficult that summer when love letters to Kathy that she had accidentally left at the sorority house were found by the cleaning staff and turned over to the alumnae council of the sorority. When she returned from summer vacation, the council (while speaking in coded language and carefully avoiding the word \"lesbian\") confronted Kuehl with the letters demanding an explanation. Kuehl later recalled that at first, she tried to deny it and failing that, \"I then just clammed up and took my sorority pin off and put it on the table and left. I cried all the way home.\" She was officially expelled from the sorority and despite assurance that no one would be told why, she was aware that rumors were spreading. Some of the members of the sorority refused to speak to her afterwards and avoided her. Kuehl moved back in with her parents under the cover story that she was homesick, but was still a member of the sorority of which they knew she loved being a part. Whenever her parents knew of a sorority meeting taking place, to prevent discovery, Kuehl would go to a coffee shop during that time and return with a story about the events of the meeting that she had not attended.\n\nDespite Kathy moving to Los Angeles and their being able to see each other daily, the social sacrifices Kuehl was contemplating put a strain on their relationship. Kuehl later recalled, \"By then, the whole idea of being queer was so overwhelming and scary. Not the sexuality, but the loss of everything. To be that way for good meant no family, no children, no career, nor normalcy, no parents. It seemed at that point that I should really get out of it. I told [Kathy] I didn't want to see her any longer.\" Kuehl had seen a man casually on and off during her relationship with Kathy and began working to make it more serious. They kissed, but they did not have sex and they almost got engaged. Kuehl could not get Kathy off her mind and broke up with the man to resume the relationship with her. Kuehl's closeted relationship with Kathy continued until the beginning of the 1970s, and had lasted 12 years before they broke up.\n\nAfter ''Dobie Gillis'' ended its run, Kuehl (as \"Sheila James\") co-starred with , formerly of '''', in the short-lived ABC television series '''', a female version of '''', in its 1964–65 season.\n\nOpportunities for acting work steadily diminished and Kuehl was forced to sell her Malibu house. She later recalled this period, saying, \"I couldn't even get a commercial.\" Due to worries about her career and being closeted, she fell into a serious depression and developed a drinking problem. She was able to move forward after seeking help. She then moved in with her then-girlfriend, Kathy, and began working at the UCLA student activities office helping students organize around the rising political movements of the 1960s.\n\nKuehl was able to make television guest appearances on ''''; ''McHale's Navy''; ''''; ''''; ''''; ''''; ''''; and '''' from 1963 to 1970. On ''Petticoat Junction'', Kuehl joined the Bradley sisters in a band called The Ladybugs, which was created to compete with . Kuehl, along with ,  and  appeared as  singers performing \"I Saw Him Standing There\" on a March 1964 episode of Sullivan's show, just weeks after the Beatles had performed \"\".\n\nBy the end of the decade, acting roles had dried up for her.  Though Kuehl \"can't state with certainty that she was blacklisted\" from further acting jobs over her sexuality, she claims that afterwards, \"with few exceptions, the phone stopped ringing.\" A pilot for a ''Dobie Gillis'' spin-off, in which the character Zelda was the lead, was produced, but the president of CBS, , thought Kuehl was \"too \" to be a star for their network. Subsequently, the pilot was not promoted and did not sell, but Kuehl was not told about this immediately. Rather, she was informed by the director, , when she arrived to shoot the following episodes. She was devastated by the news.\n\nKuehl's only acting roles beyond 1970 were in two ''Dobie Gillis'' reunion projects - a 1977 sitcom pilot produced by , ''Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?'', and a 1988 television movie sequel, ''Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis''. In both productions, Dobie had married Zelda and the two were running the Gillis family grocery store and raising a teenaged son named Georgie Gillis.\n\nReflecting on the lasting impact of her role as Zelda, Kuehl told an interviewer, \"First, there were no smart girls on television, period. All the girls were better looking than me, but dumb. I didn't mean the actresses were dumb, but that was sort of what you had to be in those days. So, a smart girl, brash, did not know she was a loser, which was sort of the theme for all the characters on ''Dobie Gillis''…you just keep doing what you are doing because you don't know there's anything wrong with you. And the other thing, of course, 20 years later I started getting letters from young women saying, 'You were such a role model for me,' and now that the women's movement had started, I could see why. An independent, smart girl, knew what she wanted, went after it, but not in a mean way. And always by the end of the show, if you were doing anything dishonest against your friends, you would repent, because friendship was always the most important thing.\"\n\n\nAfter leaving the acting profession in the early 1970s, Kuehl became an adviser to students in campus activist groups at her alma mater, , and eventually became an associate dean of students. When Kuehl was passed over for a promotion that was given to a man, Kuehl felt that her treatment had been unfair and became interested in a legal career to address the position of women in the workplace.\n\nIn 1975, at age 34, after being denied admission into UCLA, Kuehl was accepted at . In her third year she was elected class marshal and president of the student council. She received her J.D. in 1978. During her final year, she chaired the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the first group of women to be admitted to the law school, and became the second woman to win Harvard's prestigious , judged by a panel including Supreme Court Justice . Kuehl recalled that the Justice \"strode over to me, clasped my hand in his two huge hands and said, 'Lady, I like your style.'\" Kuehl was recognized in the ABA's Law Student Division magazine as one of the nation's top five law students.\n\nIt was while at Harvard that Kuehl came to grips with her sexuality. She later recalled: \n\nAfter law school, Kuehl became an associate at Richards, Watson & Gershon in Los Angeles, where her practice focused on municipal law. She later became an associate at Bersch & Kaplowitz in Beverly Hills, practicing family, anti-discrimination, and civil rights law.\n\nWhile working in private practice in Los Angeles Kuehl began fund-raising for the Sojourn Center for Battered Women (which she eventually served as chair). Staff from other shelters soon began asking Kuehl for legal advice and training in domestic-violence law. Kuehl later recalled this time saying \"I had to learn what there was, which wasn't much.\" She then joined a handful of other lawyers in trying to assist in crafting legislation on the issue which included a bill that required judges in custody cases to consider evidence of domestic violence.\n\nIn the 1980s Kuehl became an adjunct law professor at the , and later an associate professor at  where she taught courses on family law, sex discrimination, and education.\n\nDuring her 1986 inauguration as president of the Women Lawyers' Association of Los Angeles, Kuehl introduced  as her partner in the same manner that previous presidents had introduced their husbands. The incident became the lead story of California's daily law journal. (The pair would later separate in 1991, but remained close friends).\n\nIn 1989, along with Abby Leibman and Jenifer McKenna, Kuehl formed the California Women's Law Center to promote gender issues, including expanding the rights of divorced women and reforming hiring procedures in male-dominated professions, such as law enforcement.\n\n\nKuehl was elected to the  in 1994, becoming  elected to the . While running for office, Kuehl found she was able to offset some negative stereotypes people had about lesbians thanks to their familiarity with her role as Zelda. She told an interviewer, \"When people know gay people personally, they tend to feel differently about the whole community. And all of a sudden, here's a person that they knew very well that they found out was lesbian.\"\n\nIn office, Kuehl became a founding member of the . She recalled \"My Democratic colleagues were enormously welcoming. I mean it was more than I could have expected. I walked into my first Democratic caucus and , , , , and probably three or four other folks came up to me and said, 'We don't want you to have to eat lunch by yourself, so we are the honorary Gay and Lesbian Caucus.' It was lovely.\"\n\nWhen Kuehl was elected as a Democrat to the California Assembly in 1994, a Republican majority was seated for the first time in 20 years. This was due largely as an out-flowing of the enthusiasm stoked up by 's strategy supporting Republicans for congressional and senatorial seats. Kuehl recalled, \"The Republican majority was quite a different kind of Republican, not a moderate, not a Rockefeller Republican. They were primarily Bible-thumpers and very right-wing. So, it was not the most welcoming Republican group, though they loved Zelda Gilroy, and it was very difficult for them because they already liked me so much…. And to their surprise, we all got along very well. ...The Republicans were pretty horrible about LGBT stuff. They all virtually said stuff like, 'Well, they're all spawn of the devil, oh, but not you, Sheila….'\"\n\nOne of the first acts Kuehl did while in the Assembly was to introduce a bill (The Dignity for All Students Act – AB 222) to protect public-school students from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The bill was supported by most of her fellow Democrats whom Kuehl later recalled were brought \"into a space where they were in a civil rights movement where they had never been at their age and they were feeling it and felt good about themselves when they would stand up and support me.\" The debate was cited by the media, such as the LA Times, for its moving speeches, most notably Assemblyman 's support of the bill which included a here-to unknown revelation that his brother had been bisexual and died of AIDS. The bill failed to pass the Assembly by one vote (it was opposed by 37 lawmakers, including seven Democrats). Supporters of the bill blamed \"a state-wide public relations campaign by anti-gay groups aimed at moderate Democrats\" which \"featured mailers, newspaper ads and protests largely targeted at Latino lawmakers.\" Kuehl's opponents also held that the \"proposal would open the door to a sweeping  in public schools.\" Republican Assemblyman  claimed the bill wasn't about \"civil rights, but it's about special rights [for homosexuals],\" and it's \"the issue that will divide this state and country more than any other.\"\n\nWhile in the assembly, Kuehl served as  during the 1997–98 legislative session, becoming the first woman in California history to hold the position. Kuehl served three full terms (six years) in the California Assembly, which was the maximum allowed under term limits that had been adopted in 1990.\n\n\nAfter three terms in the Assembly, she was elected to the  in 2000, beating Assemblyman  in the Democratic primary and becoming the first openly gay person elected to the Senate. Re-elected in 2004 with 65.7% of the vote, she was repeatedly voted the \"smartest\" member of the California Legislature.\n\nIn 2002 Kuehl co-authored the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act that defined marriage as a civil contract between two persons. The bill went on to pass the state legislature – the first time a state legislative body in the USA voted to approve same-sex marriage rather than respond to a court order to do so. The bill was vetoed on September 7, 2005, by   . who held that the matter should be decided by the courts or by popular referendum.\n\nIn 2004, , the , held that denying homosexuals the right to marry was a violation of the due process clause in the California Constitution and allowed them to go forward (until a later Court order was made). After the mayor's announcement Kuehl presided over a number of same-sex marriages on the steps of San Francisco's City Hall rotunda. Among those whose wedding she officiated was Assemblymember  (who authored AB 205, a sweeping domestic partner benefits law) and her partner for twenty-eight years Sharon Stricker (a poet and activist). The couple's newly married son and daughter-in-law were in attendance. Kuehl also officiated over the weddings of  and her partner, Lydia Vaias; Jehan Agrama and Dwora Fried;  and Ellen Ledley; Barrie Levy and Linda Garnets; and Avi Rose and Ron Strochlic. Assemblymember  (who had recently introduced a bill to change the family code to allow marriage equality) also attended the ceremonies giving a blessing in English and Hebrew to the couples.\n\nAlso in 2004, Kuehl authored Senate Bill 1234, an omnibus act intended to protect Californians from hate crimes, which the bill defined as criminal acts committed in whole or in part because of the victims' actual or perceived disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or association with persons with any of those characteristics. The bill targeted crimes, not First Amendment-protected speech. It also protected undocumented immigrants from deportation due to reporting hate crimes, increased civil protections from discrimination, and provided for law enforcement training concerning crimes against homeless persons and law enforcement response to homelessness; the bill was later enacted into law.\n\nIn 2006, Kuehl sponsored a bill to prohibit the adoption by any school district in California of any instructional material that discriminates against persons based on their gender or sexual orientation.\n\nThroughout her career as a legislator, Kuehl took a leadership role on health care policy. Her foremost objective was securing passage of legislation to establish a  system in California. SB 840 passed both houses of the legislature in 2006, but was vetoed by Schwarzenegger; it was reintroduced in 2007. SB 840 passed both houses of the California legislature in August 2008 and was, again, vetoed by Schwarzenegger.\n\nOn January 28, 2008, '''' reported that Kuehl planned to vote against a health care plan sponsored by Governor Schwarzenegger and supported by a majority of Democrats in the Assembly, while opposed by a majority of Republicans. Her opposition along with the opposition of Senator  led the ''Times'' to predict that California's widely touted healthcare bill – widely but inaccurately called \"universal\" coverage – would be effectively killed. However, by the time the bill came to the Senate Health Committee, chaired by Kuehl, all but one of the Democratic Senators on the committee had grave doubts about the bill and, after an eleven-hour hearing on the bill and an intervening week to caucus, on January 28, 2008, one Democrat voted yes, three abstained and three (including Kuehl), along with all Republicans, voted in opposition.\n\nDuring her time in the state Legislature Kuehl authored bills pertaining to domestic violence, child support services, family leave, and discrimination based on gender, disability and sexual orientation. Later when speaking to an interviewer she reflected \"I was a women's rights attorney and a law professor. My interest was primarily issues of equality on the basis of gender, whether it was workplace discrimination, protection from domestic violence and sexual assault, child care, custody issues for married women. That was my area of expertise, so we started with that. I had participated in writing virtually all of the domestic violence laws, and then brought bills to expand them once I was [in Sacramento].

She assumed office on December 1, 2014, thus becoming the first openly LGBTQ person to ever serve on the Board. As the representative of Los Angeles County's 3rd Supervisorial District, she serves nearly two million residents, and is responsible for managing 431 square miles of land stretching from the Pacific ocean to Los Feliz, and from Venice up to San Fernando. In 2018, she served as chair of the Board of Supervisors.\n\nIn her capacity as Supervisor, she served as chair of the Board of Commissioners of First 5 LA, First Vice Chair of the board of directors of LA Metro, and sat on the Board of the new Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) known as the Clean Power Alliance.\n\nIn her first three years on the Board, she undertook or collaborated in a number of initiatives and motions. A partial list of her work includes raising the minimum wage, creating a Citizens' Oversight Commission for the Sheriff's Department, providing funding and services for LA County's homeless population and those trying to find and keep affordable housing.\n\nKuehl previously had a ten-year romantic relationship with , who served as a deputy mayor in L.A. Osborn went on to support Kuehl's run for Supervisor and joined her staff as principal deputy for strategy and policy.\n\nLos Angeles County limits its Supervisors to three consecutive four-year terms in accord with a 2002 measure. When running for the office she was asked if she missed acting and responded that the camaraderie in public service mirrored her favorite aspect of acting, and then stated \"I suppose if I get to be a supervisor and then I'm termed out, I'll be, you know, fairly elderly but still able to do things, and then I guess my ambition would be to be Betty White for a couple of years.\"\n\nReflecting on her political career Kuehl told an interviewer, \"I was very proud of the fact that I wasn't too frightened to run for office as a gay person. [You imagine] people making anonymous phone calls in the middle of the night to tell you you're a horrible person only in worse language than that, or imagine getting spat at. It's the same thing people go through about coming out.

The warrant is related to an investigation into Kuehl's involvement with an alleged \"pay to play\" scheme; a former County official claimed that Kuehl and others improperly awarded a series of contracts for sexual harassment training programs. A few days after the raids, the California Department of Justice took over the investigation. In an August 2024 court approved agreement ending the investigation, they stated there was \"insufficient evidence to support the filing of any criminal charges\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* (archive.org snapshot, Jan. 21, 2022)\n* (final snapshot at archive.org)\n*\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He represented the city on the Executive Board of the Gateway Cities Council of Governments, where he played a key role in developing plans to improve the . He served on the  and Lower Los Angeles Mountains and Rivers Conservancy where he supported the preservation of open space throughout the district.\n\nAs Mayor, he worked to improve relations between the city, the community, and the police department. He helped build new parks, addressed budget issues, helped to improve the transportation infrastructure, and improved senior programs and education for the city's children. In order to alleviate overcrowding, De La Torre fought for new and better school facilities. He fought for honest and effective government, and led South Gate residents in a grassroots campaign to recall corrupt elected officials, stabilize the city's financial condition, and rebuild public trust.\n\n\nDe La Torre was one of only two council members not involved in the corruption scandal, which prompted a January 2003 recall of three other members of the city council, as well as the South Gate city treasurer. The recall, which he helped lead, was the culmination of a long fight to clean up the corruption in South Gate.\n\nFor years, South Gate had been unofficially controlled by , who once boasted to being the \"King of South Gate.\" Politicians who ran against the Robles slate often found themselves the victims of anonymous, libelous campaign mailers. For example, some were charged with child molestation, alcoholism, and not supporting children living in other statesall unfounded claims.\n\nDuring his reelection campaign for city council, Hector De La Torre was challenged by a political unknown who was also named Hector De La Torre. The incumbent charged that this was an attempt to confuse voters and remove him from the city council. Despite the challenge, City Councilmember De La Torre came in first in the election.\n\nRobles's critics faced personal as well as political danger. Many received death threats. Joseph Ruiz, a political activist who campaigned against Robles's allies, fell victim to arson when his business was hit with four Molotov cocktails. And Henry Gonzalez, then mayor of South Gate, was shot in the head by an unknown assailant.\n\nThe January 2003 recall ousted Robles from his position as City Treasurer, along with three of his allies on the City Council. The recall effort passed by a resounding 8-1 ratio. By the time the new councilmembers were sworn in, the Robles majority on the City Council had completely depleted the eight million dollars in the city's reserve.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Albert Robles was indicted \"on 39 counts of money laundering, bribery, wire fraud and public corruption.\" Prosecutors argued that \"he used his elected office and political influence to funnel money from city projects to family and friends between 1998 and 2003.\" De La Torre testified in the trial against the former city treasurer. Robles was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison.\n\n\nDe La Torre served as Chair of the Accountability and Administrative Review Committee, responsible for overseeing the implementation of state programs and identifying potential savings.

In 2018, Kiley authored legislation to make it easier for students to transfer s.\n\nAfter winning a second term in the State Assembly, Kiley ran for the  in California's . He finished second in the primary, but lost the runoff to fellow Assemblyman . Soon after the start of the new legislative session, Kiley introduced legislation to close for private use a controversial  office that catered exclusively to state legislators and staff. In a statement to '''', Kiley said: \"This is supposed to be a government of the people, by the people and for the people, not an oligarchy where a gilded political class enjoys privileges that aren’t available to the people that we represent.\"\n\nAccording to the , Kiley is \"a conservative who often flirts with the fringes of the GOP\". He has said climate change is real, but opposed Governor Gavin Newsom's executive orders requiring all new vehicles in California to be  by 2035 and banning oil-drilling by 2045. He is a supporter of . Kiley introduced legislation to ban local and state governments from implementing vaccine requirements. After Joe Biden won the 2020 election and  refused to concede while making claims of fraud, Kiley refused to say whether Biden won the 2020 election legitimately. Kiley has said his position is to \"stay out of national politics altogether\", and that \"national politics is a distraction that is used frankly by those in power in Sacramento [as] kind of a smokescreen for their own failures.\"\n\nIn March 2024, former FEC chairperson, Ann Ravel, filed a complaint against Kevin Kiley \"alleging he excessively used campaign funds to support a conservative coalition seeking to roll back parts of Proposition 47.\"\n\n\n\n\nThough he voted to authorize $1 billion of emergency pandemic spending for Governor Newsom in March 2020, saying \"to trust in Governor Newsom’s leadership and listen to his guidance\", Kiley later said Newsom \"made a mockery of that trust\" and, alongside fellow California legislator , sued in June 2020 to remove Newsom's emergency powers. Kiley lost the case on appeal. Kiley published a book in January 2021 titled ''Recall Gavin Newsom: The Case Against America's Most Corrupt Governor.''\n\nOn July 6, 2021, Kiley announced his candidacy for  in the .

Though vaccinated against COVID-19, Kiley pledged to overturn vaccine and mask mandates Newsom implemented if he became governor.\n\n\nIn 2020, Kiley urged passage of his bill that would require the potential successor of then-candidate for vice president and Senator  to be elected by California's voters and not appointed by the governor; he reiterated that view during the 2021 gubernatorial recall campaign by pledging to allow voters to pick a replacement for Senator  if he became governor and her seat became vacant. Kiley later flagged a constitutional issue with Newsom's appointment of  to replace Harris and Padilla's expected service until January 2023, since the  stipulates that such appointees serve \"until the people fill the vacancies by election\".\n\nAfter lawmakers in the state assembly passed a bill to address the issue that would require voters to select two senators for the same seatone to serve in the  from November 2022 to January 2023 and another for January 2023 to January 2029Kiley said Newsom should have called a special election to fill Harris's seat much earlier, and that the bill would solve the problem in \"the most undemocratic way possible\". Newsom eventually signed the bill, which meant California's voters had to vote simultaneously for both the lame-duck Senate seat and the next full Senate term.\n\n\nKiley married Chelsee Gardner on December 30, 2023. The ceremony took place at Pioneer Church in Auburn, California, the oldest church in Placer County. Chelsee and Kevin met at a community event in Rocklin, California, celebrating the Fourth of July. Kevin proposed to Chelsee in the summer of 2023 in the same park where they first met. The couple reside in Roseville.

He finished first in the top-two primary on June 7, 2016, and again faced Eggman in the general election on November 8, 2016. Denham won re-election with 52.4% of the vote to Eggman's 47.6%. More than $11 million was spent on the race, mostly from outside groups.\n\n\n\nIn May 2017, investor  became the third Democrat to announce that he would challenge Denham in 2018. He said he would focus on job creation and economic opportunity. \"There's just not a lot of opportunities for entry-level positions,\" Harder said. \"What we need [is] a better, positive vision for what the economic development of the valley can bring.\"\n\nChallenging Denham for the Republican nomination was veterinarian Ted Howze, who criticized Denham's support for what critics characterized as \"amnesty\" for illegal immigrants. Denham came in first in the top-two primary, with 37.8% of the vote. Denham was one of ten military veterans to whose campaigns Ambassador 's PAC gave $10,000 apiece during the 2018 race.\n\nThe ''Modesto Bee'' wrote on May 12, 2018, that \"Jeff Denham is going to be hard to beat.\" By this point, the original field of Democratic candidates had been cut in half from ten. In addition to Harder, they included Sue Zwahlen, a former emergency room nurse and school board member; Michael Eggman, a former farmer who had challenged Denham in 2014 and 2016; Virginia Madueño, the former mayor of ; and Michael Barkley.

The HSLF's  said Denham was “leading the charge on some of the most important animal protection issues in Washington.” In the 113th Congress, Denham was the lead sponsor of the Pets on Trains Act (H.R. 2066), which required  to allow  on some passenger trains. He led the effort in the House Agriculture Committee to defeat the “King amendment,” which would nullify hundreds of state and local laws on food safety, animal welfare, and agriculture. He was a lead sponsor of the Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments (H.R. 1731), which would improve the treatment of hundreds of millions of laying hens.

He was active in working with law enforcement to halt illegal growing of cannabis. Denham opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana, saying that \"legalizing drugs, including marijuana, is a detriment to society and will endanger future generations.\" He voted for allowing veterans access to , if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation, the second time the Veterans Equal Access Amendment was introduced in 2016.\n\n\nAs of January 2018, he had a 6% lifetime score from the environmental advocacy group the .\n\n\nDenham had argued that the national deficit is the biggest issue for the United States, and called it a threat to the nation's freedom.\n\nIn July 2012, he criticized an event put on by the , which cost $268,732.

He also voted against the bill that reopened the government and avoided a default.\n\nDenham voted for the , which he praised as \"a historic milestone\".

Denham said that he could only support a repeal-bill that kept significant parts of Obamacare intact, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions and expanded Medicaid coverage. However, on May 4, 2017, Denham voted to repeal the  (Obamacare) and pass . Denham said that he voted for the revised version of AHCA, which allows states to seek a waiver to allow insurers to charge individuals with preexisting conditions higher premiums, because the bill would provide $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions. He voted for this version of the bill before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had estimated its impact; the CBO had estimated that 24 million Americans would lose insurance under the previous version of the bill.\n\nDuring his re-election campaign, Denham falsely claimed that ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker had found his opponent's claims about the impact of Obamacare's repeal on preexisting conditions to be false. ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker responded, saying that Denham was \"twisting an unrelated fact check and [was] misleading voters.\"\n\n\nDenham, who served as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads, had opposed plans for a  between  and . On March 6, 2017, the ''New York Times'' quoted him as saying that “no more federal dollars will go to California high-speed rail.” He charged that $600 million of state funds allocated by Proposition 1A in 2008 for 's electrification was being diverted. “'They are stealing Prop 1A money and using it for something else,” Denham said.\n\n\nIn October 2013, Denham co-sponsored the comprehensive immigration reform bill introduced by House Democrats. In announcing his support for the bill, he said: \"We can't afford any more delays. I support an earned path to citizenship to allow those who want to become citizens to demonstrate a commitment to our country, learn English, pay fines and back taxes and pass background checks.\"\n\nIn August 2014, Denham broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the .\n\nIn the autumn of 2017, Denham unsuccessfully \"pleaded with Trump...not to end the  program, which provided temporary deportation relief and work permits for hundreds of thousands of people brought to the country illegally as children.\"Wire, Sarah;  ; ''Los Angeles Times''; April 12, 2018.\n\nIn May 2018, Denham was one of a dozen House Republicans who, defying Speaker , forced a vote on immigration in an effort to help the so-called Dreamers.Stolberg, Sheryl Gay;  ; ''New York Times''; May 9, 2018. In a May 16 interview with , Denham said that \"the only way we're going to get the border secured is actually working together to pass something off the floor.\" In order to gain support for the Mexican border wall, he said, Republicans must support action to help Dreamers. \"The only way you're going to get the 60 members on a bipartisan border security bill is with this solution that is equally as important that the president of the United States is asking for.\"\n\nDenham said in June 2018 that he had forged an agreement with more conservative House members that would provide temporary residency visas for young immigrants and that would also fund Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico.White, Jeremy B.;  ; ''The Independent''; June 7, 2018.\n\nIn a June 7, 2018, interview on , Denham said, \"I want to see a fixed to our broken immigration system\" and that \"You shouldn't be tearing families apart.\" He described the Trump Administration's \"zero tolerance policy\" as \"a bad idea.\"\n\n\nIn June 2018, Denham joined three other local members of Congress in introducing legislation “to cut through red tape to raise the spillway gates at  and improve water supply reliability for Merced County.” The measure “would provide an additional 57,000 acre-feet for irrigation, groundwater replenishment and environmental benefits.”\n\n\nIn May 2016, Denham initially voted against an amendment to a defense appropriations bills by Democratic Representative  which would prohibit government contracts with companies that don't comply with President Obama's executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT workers. The following week, Denham reversed course and voted for Maloney's amendment to uphold President Obama's executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\nDenham did not make an endorsement in the 2016 presidential race. He said that he planned to support the Republican nominee but did not specifically endorse , and that \"Like many Americans from both parties, my first choice for president is not on the ballot in November.\"\n\n\nOn November 21, 2017, Denham introduced the Supporting Mitigation Activities and Resiliency Targets for Rebuilding Act, also known as the SMART Rebuilding Act. The SMART Rebuilding Act, which proposed cost-saving  (FEMA) reforms, was included in the U.S. House's subsequent Disaster Recovery Reform Act and supplemental appropriations bill. The disaster aid package, which included $81 billion in additional disaster relief funding in addition to Denham's FEMA reforms, was passed by the House in December 2017 in a bipartisan vote.\n\n\nDenham and his wife Sonia have two children. She is Hispanic, and Denham has said that he learned Spanish to communicate with her family, including to help his Mexican father-in-law through the process of gaining U.S. citizenship.

His parents divorced when he was three. His mother had various mental disorders and was regularly in and out of the hospital. At 11 years old, his relatives convinced Mandelman to move to San Francisco, where his paternal grandmother was. But she was too old to take care of him so he lived between homes. Mandelman attended  and .\n\nMandelman earned a B.A. in History from Yale College, a Master of Public Policy from Harvard’s John F.

Mandelman went on to win in the November general election.\n\nIn 2019, he authored an ordinance to create the  LGBTQ Cultural District; the ordinance was passed unanimously by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\n\nMandelman supported a resolution that expressed opposition to California , which mandates that localities allow denser housing near \"job-rich\" areas and transit hubs in California. In 2021, Mandelman proposed to allow construction of fourplexes on single lots in San Francisco. Mandelman's aide explained that the bill was intended to preempt  (California Senate Bill 9, which was a new version of California Senate Bill 50), which Mandelman opposed. In 2022, the Board of Supervisors passed Mandelman's bill. Mayor  vetoed the legislation, saying that the bill was intended to sidestep California state legislation to increase housing and that Mandelman's bill included provisions that would make it harder, not easier, to build more housing.\n\nIn 2021, Mandelman opposed the construction of a 500-unit apartment complex on a Nordstrom's valet parking lot. He endorsed  for California Assembly District 17. The ''San Francisco Chronicle'' tied this endorsement to Mandelman's vote to block the 500-unit housing construction project in Supervisor 's district in San Francisco; Haney was running for the same district seat as Campos. According to the ''Chronicle'', it is unusual for supervisors to block projects in the district of another supervisor if that supervisor approves of the project.\n\nIn 2018, Mandelman co-authored a bill increasing fines for the illegal demolition of homes in order to preserve rent-controlled housing and curb the loss of residential housing. He called for reform of the Ellis Act in 2018 to protect certain tenants from evictions. In 2018, Mandelman sponsored a resolution declaring public support for Proposition 10, which would repeal the  and thus allow local jurisdictions to create their own rent control rules.\n\nMandelman opposes high-rise buildings in San Francisco. In 2024, Mandelman voted to override Mayor London Breed's veto of anti-housing legislation that imposed height and density restrictions on housing in the northeast waterfront and Jackson Square. \n\n\nMandelman introduced legislation in 2018 to streamline the opening of more residential care facilities by removing the requirement that such facilities need to obtain conditional use permits if they are serving seven or more residents in several zoning districts, but not those zoned for single-family or two-family homes.\n\nIn 2019, Mandelman authored legislation implementing the housing conservatorship program created by 's SB 1045 for unhoused individuals suffering from severe mental illness and substance use disorder. Mandelman has repeatedly pushed for expansion of the City’s use of its existing conservatorship tools, and of State laws restricting eligibility for conservatorships.\n\nIn 2022, the Board of Supervisors unanimously passed an expanded version of Mandelman's 2020 “A Place for All” ordinance, making it the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to offer all people experiencing homelessness in the City a safe place to sleep.\n\n\nShortly after his 2018 election, Mandelman, alongside former supervisor , was arrested for blocking a street outside Marriott's  hotel during a Labor Day protest, organized by  Local 2, against Marriott's wages. In 2019, the Board's Public Safety and Neighborhood Services Committee held a hearing on \"worker rights in the \" called by Mandelman. In November 2020, the Board of Supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance authored by Mandelman and Supervisor  requiring  airlines and contractors to expand health care benefits for employees.\n\n\nMandelman came out as gay while at Yale University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor  and later resigned in the face of extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pleaded guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64&nbsp;months in federal prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.\n\n\nEdmund Jew was born in San Francisco, California in 1960. The Jew family emigrated from  around the start of the 20th century. His grandfather James Jew, who arrived to the city in 1913, established an employment agency in 1925 and the Canton Flower Shop in  in 1927. He became a distinguished leader in the Chinese community after serving many local Chinese American associations.\n\nJew was raised in Chinatown. After graduating from , Jew attended  and , where he earned a degree in . In 1984, he also earned a  degree from .\n\nBefore entering politics, Jew was an entrepreneur. Among other enterprises, he managed his family's flower shop and owned a local taxi company named Howard Mock Jew, Inc. In addition, he invested in real estate. He bought his first property in San Francisco at the age of 21 and, as of 2002, he had a real estate portfolio (including properties in the Bay Area and Arizona) worth as much as $5&nbsp;million.\n\n, Jew's wife Lorene and their daughter Cammie live in . He also has a brother named David Jew.\n\n\nJew began his political career in the 1980s, establishing the Chinese Neighborhood Resource Center, which helped to clean up alleyways in Chinatown. He was then appointed by the mayor to serve on the Ten Year Plan Council to End Chronic Homelessness and the Office of Aging Advisory Council, the later oversaw the city's senior services. Like his grandfather, Jew was heavily involved in local Chinese-American politics, serving as president of the Jew Family Benevolent Association, the Yeong Wo Benevolent Association, the Hay Sen Benevolent Association, the Hip Sen Benevolent Association, and the Lung Kong Benevolent Association. He was also an active participant of numerous other community organizations, such as the Northeast Community Federal Credit Union, the Chinese Holocaust Museum, the Sunset Residents Association, and the Sunset Parkside Education and Action Committee. Jew once served as vice chairman of the San Francisco County Republican Central Committee before re-registering as an Independent and then as a Democrat.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Jew was District 4 then-supervisor 's volunteer community liaison. Jew first ran for Yee's District 4 seat in 2002 when Yee ran for the . Despite Yee's endorsement, Jew finished third, missing the runoff election. In 2006, Jew again ran for same supervisor seat when  ran for the California Assembly. Jew led other candidates including his top challenger  in the first round with 26% first-place votes. He eventually won the closely fought election after securing a 52% majority. In December 2006, Mayor  appointed Jew to serve out the remainder of Ma's term; he took office in January 2007.\n\n\n\n\nOn May 18, 2007, six months after Jew took office as supervisor, agents from the  (FBI), armed with a federal warrant, raided his office at , his houses in San Francisco and Burlingame, and his Chinatown flower shop. The FBI sought evidence in Jew's computers and records regarding \"potentially criminal allegations\" surrounding an extortion attempt.\n\nJew said that he had been contacted by the owners of a local chain  shop, , to resolve Quickly's business permit issues. Jew demanded $80,000 for his assistance, but agreed to accept $40,000. The shop owners then contacted the FBI, which supplied the cash for a sting operation. The FBI used an undercover agent to meet with Jew and hand over the money.\n\nJew claimed that he turned over the money to a man named Robert Chan from a land use consulting firm called Bridge Consulting, though this was never substantiated. He also asked that half of the money be donated to the Friends of Sunset Playground, a local organization set up to raise money for the renovation of a playground at 28th Avenue and Lawton Street. The donation was later rejected by the group's fiscal agency, Sunset Youth Services, after the directors, Dawn and Ron Stueckle and Delvin Mack learned the nature of the donation source.\n\nOn September 20, 2007, federal prosecutors charged Jew with one count of mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly. Jew denied any wrongdoing. He questioned what influence he could have over the issuing of permits, and reiterated his refusal to resign his position, despite insistence from Mayor . On November 7, 2007, a federal grand jury added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business, Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Jew pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n\n\nIn late May 2007, following the FBI raid, questions surfaced about whether or not Jew actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not Jew therefore met the residency requirements of his supervisor position. The house in question (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said that the house was vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity. Jew claimed that he spent most of his time at his flower shop, but was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, San Francisco District Attorney  issued a warrant for Jew's arrest, and charged him with nine felony counts of perjury, election code violations, voter fraud, and providing false documents. Jew turned himself in to the Burlingame Police Department.\n\nOn June 18, 2007, City Attorney  sought approval from then   to remove Ed Jew from office. Citing records that showed little use of utilities and interviews with 32 neighbors, Herrera declared that Jew had violated the residency requirements of the City Charter by falsely claiming in his campaign papers that he was a resident of San Francisco. Mayor Gavin Newsom said the case against Jew was \"very damning\" and raised concern about Jew continuing to cast votes while the legitimacy of his residency was in question.\n\nOn July 4, 2007, Jew's attorneys issued a 138-page response to Herrera's petition, arguing that even if Jew had not lived full-time in his home in District 4, his election had not violated any laws. They also accused Herrara of political bias in bringing the charges. Herrera denied Jew's accusations, and released signed bank loan documents on which Jew had identified his address in Burlingame. On July 17, 2007, Jew pleaded not guilty to the perjury charges, and was granted bail after Jew agreed to surrender his passport.\n\nDuring the preliminary hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house and spent most of his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a  inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.\n\n\n\n| birth_place = , \n| death_date  =\n| death_place =\n| cause          =\n| alias          =\n| motive         =\n| charge         = \n| conviction     = Guilty\n| conviction_penalty        = Bribery/extortion: 64 months in prison and $10,000 finePerjury: 12 months in jail, 3 years in probation and $2,000 fine\n| conviction_status         = \n| occupation     =\n}}\nOn September 25, 2007, Mayor Gavin Newsom suspended Jew for alleged official misconduct and began the process of removing him from office. The city attorney also served Jew with civil charges of misconduct for allegedly lying about where he lived. Deputy budget director  was appointed as Jew's temporary replacement on the Board of Supervisors. On January 10, 2008, Jew tendered his resignation in exchange for Herrera and Newsom dropping both the civil lawsuit and misconduct proceeding before the Ethics Commission regarding his residency violation. In a letter, he noted that he resigned due to tremendous legal expenses and swore never to seek public office again in the best interest of his family. Chu became Jew's interim successor until the election in November 2008.\n\n\nOn October 10, 2008, Jew changed his plea to guilty on the federal mail fraud and extortion charges. The following month, he also changed his plea to guilty on the perjury charges.\n\nOn April 3, 2009, Jew was sentenced to 64 months in prison and fined $10,000 on the federal extortion charge. Prosecutors stated that he \"preyed upon and victimized the very people whom he had proposed to support in his campaign: small business owners in the Sunset District.\" On April 22, 2009, he was sentenced to one year in county jail, three years of probation, and a $2,000 fine on the state perjury charge.

He served two terms as a city councilman and two terms as mayor of .\n\n\nNorberg was born in February 4, 1907 in , on the , Ontario, Canada. His parents, Albert Norberg and Thilda Osterberg, were both Swedish. He came with his parents to  as a child. During intermittent periods of study at  he acquired bookkeeping and accounting skills which he used while working for the . He also established a career in New York as a  newspaper columnist and magazine editor for . There he met Barbara Drew Collins, an actress and member of the . They married on March 28, 1936 in , New York City. When his wife Barbara died in the summer of 1972, Norberg married Wies Christianson (1933-2017) in June 1973, at the Flanders Mansion. They were married in the costumes inspired by the play ''Twilth Night.''\n\n\nIn 1940, he and Barbara came to  on vacation and they decided to make it their permanent home. The Gunnar Norberg House, on the southeast corner of Carmelo Stret and 10th Avenue was a wedding gift for the newlyweds from the brides parents. The -style home was built in 1909.\n\n\nDuring the summer of 1941, Norberg opened a travel service which he operated until his retirement in 1979. He also started an accounting service in Carmel during the war years.\n\nFollowing the , Norberg was drafted by the  during , serving from 1943 to 1945, but was never assigned to a combat unit due to his poor eyesight. He became a citizenship of the United States when he enlisted in the Army. He was inducted at the  and eneded up at Camp Beale. Private Norberg became editor for the camp's newspaper, and helped set up the military installation's first football team and symphony orchestra. He received an honorable discharge to embark on a new role within the . Eventually, this organization evolved into the .\n\n\nNorberg's political journey in Carmel began with his election to the City Council in 1958. He was loved for his efforts in safeguarding the village's character, yet despised for his abrasive approach in doing so.\n\nAlthough Norberg faced a temporary setback in 1962 because of his outspoken views, he made impressive comebacks, winning elections in 1966 and 1970. He was vice-mayor from 1972 to 1975. In 1976, Norberg was elected Carmel's new mayor succeeding mayor Eugene Hammond. He won a second term in 1978 when he was reappointed mayor of Carmel by the City Council.\n\nThroughout his tenure, he encountered resistance from his peers regarding his progressive ideas, such as advocating against increased hotel square footage and proposing a 500-foot distance between similar tourist-oriented shops. Feeling like a \"lone voice in the wilderness,\" Norberg's unwavering commitment earned him the name of the \"Abominable No-Man\" among some pro-development residents. Additionally, under Norberg's leadership, Carmel took legal action, filing two lawsuits to protect the city from unfavorable development in Carmel Valley. He continued the legacy set by , standing firmly against unrestricted growth, excessive freeway development, the unchecked expansion of motels, and the overwhelming influx of tourism. Norberg ardently advocated for preserving the natural beauty and embracing a simpler, more authentic way of life.\n\nAfter  died in 1944, his property,  or Flanders Mansion, was about to fall into the hands of developers. Norberg mounted the \"Save the Flanders Estate\" campaign. As vice-mayor, he persuaded the city council to buy the Flanders Mansion and adjoining  in 1972 from the Flanders heirs for $275,000 ().\n\nIn May 1979,  purchased the Pebble Beach Corporation for over $71&nbsp;million (). Norberg expressed his concerns about the purchase as he believed that 20th Century-Fox had a significant surplus of funds due to the success of \"Star Wars.\" The City Council, in response, passed a resolution opposing the acquisition.\n\nUpon 's decision not to seek re-election as the mayor of Carmel from 1986 to 1988, Norberg and former mayor Charlotte Townsend expressed their hopes for a return to a simpler, more ordinary way of life, with diminished commercialization in the city. Norberg emphasized his belief that Carmel had experienced a surge in commercialization during the previous two years, asserting that the essence of \"Carmel wasn't made by spending money. It was made by spending the time and effort of dedicated people.\" The preamble to the city charter of Carmel underscores its primary focus on being a residential, with business interests taking a secondary position in importance.\n\n\nNorberg and his wife both acted in plays at 's . In 1971, Norberg and president of the  Guild, photographer , played a role in a campaign to preserve the Forest Theater, an outdoor venue.

He cosponsored  the Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination Act of 2013 (H.R. 3344). The bill addresses predatory recruiters who use international labor recruitment as a human trafficking medium. On January 23, 2014, Honda hosted a training at the San Jose International Airport for airport and airline employees on how to detect signs of human trafficking.\n\nHonda is a cosponsor of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (H.R. 15), which entails comprehensive immigration reform to increase high skill visas, reunite families, and provide a pathway to citizenship for those living in the shadows.\n\n\nHonda has been recognized as a long-time supporter of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, with a 100% scorecard rating from the  since 2001. HRC endorsed Honda for his 2014 reelection. In the 1990s, he supported same-sex partner benefits as a Santa Clara County Supervisor. In 2008, he was a co-founder of the Congressional Equality Caucus, when there were only two openly gay congresspersons. He opposed the use of taxpayer funds to protect the  in the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2013, Honda worked with Mayor of Campbell Evan Low to raise awareness for the ban against blood donations from gay and bisexual men. In 2015, Honda revealed in a speech at the event Courageous Conversation, a one-day symposium that addresses how administrators can work to make their schools safer for their students, that his granddaughter Malisa is transgender. \"As both an individual, and as an educator, I have experienced and witnessed bullying in its many forms. And as the proud jichan, or grandpa, of a transgender grandchild, I hope that my granddaughter can feel safe going to school without fear of being bullied. I refuse to be a bystander while millions of people are dealing with the effects of bullying on a daily basis.\"\n\n\nIn 2013, Honda introduced the Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act (H.R. 615), one of the main bills in the Democratic Party's Make it in America Agenda, which would create a commission of private-sector experts to designate market-changing technologies. These technologies would be eligible for a consumer tax credit as long as they are made in the United States. Honda introduced the Scaling Up Manufacturing Act (H.R. 616). The bill would provide companies a 25% tax credit on the costs associated with building their first manufacturing facility in the United States.\n\nHonda was a vocal supporter of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation proposed by President Obama to help revitalize American manufacturing. He is a cosponsor of the bipartisan Revitalizing American Manufacturing Innovation Act (H.R. 2996) and has urged President Obama to locate a manufacturing hub in Silicon Valley to focus on the domestic development of the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing tools.\n\nHonda used his position as a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee to prioritize funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program which works with small and medium-sized manufacturers to help them create and retain jobs, increase profits, and save time and money.\n\n\nAs the Representative for the heart of Silicon Valley, Honda has been intimately involved in technology and nanotechnology policy for many years. He has supported the principle of network neutrality, and is a cosponsor of the Open Internet Preservation Act (H.R. 3982).\n\nHonda was critical of the National Security Agency's surveillance of electronic communications as a violation of privacy. He is an original cosponsor of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet Collection, and Online Monitoring Act (USA FREEDOM ACT - H.R 3361) which seeks to rein in the dragnet collection of data by the NSA, increase transparency of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, provide businesses the ability to release information regarding FISA requests, and create an independent constitutional advocate to argue cases before the FISC. Honda has been a proponent of government intelligence transparency and has pushed to require that top-line intelligence spending be disclosed during annual budget submission to Congress through his co-sponsorship of the Intelligence Budget Transparency Act (H.R. 3855).\n\nIn 2002, he introduced one of the first nanotechnology bills in Congress, the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act of 2002, which sought to establish a Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board to advise the President on a range of policy matters. Such a board was recommended by the National Research Council in its review of the National nanotechnology Initiative, Small Wonders, Endless Frontiers.\n\nIn 2003, he worked with then-Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY), to introduce the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003.\n\nThis bill authorized federal investments in nanotechnology research and development, restructured the National Nanotechnology Initiative to improve interagency coordination and the level of input from outside experts in the field, and laid the path to address novel social, ethical, philosophical, legal, environmental health issues that might arise. H.R. 766 was passed overwhelmingly by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 7, 2003, signed into law on December 3, 2003, and to date has been funded at nearly $4 billion.\n\nHonda continued his interest in nanotechnology by convening the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology with then-controller Steve Westly in 2005. This group met numerous times to discuss and develop strategies to promote the San Francisco Bay Area and all of California as the national and worldwide center for nanotechnology research, development and commercialization. Under the direction of Working Chair Scott Hubbard, then-Director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center, the Task Force spent a year developing recommendations that would assure California a leading position in what could be a trillion-dollar economic sector. The recommendations were included in the BRTFN report, Thinking Big About Thinking Small.\n\nHonda developed two pieces of legislation based on the report: 1) the Nanomanufacturing Investment Act of 2005 and 2) the Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities Act.\n\nMany provisions of these bills were included in larger pieces of legislation, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009 and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, that passed the House of Representatives in the 111th Congress.\n\nMike Honda was recognized by the Foresight Institute, which awarded him its Foresight Institute Government Prize in 2006.\n\n\nCongressman Honda has supported expanding and making permanent the Research and Development tax credit, and in the 113th Congress is a cosponsor of the bipartisan H.R. 4438, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014. He has called the research credit, \"the best incentive in the tax code to ensure that companies continue to conduct their R&D in the U.S.\"\n\n\nHonda has been a vocal advocate for expanding the Social Security program. In the 113th Congress, Honda introduced H.R. 3118, the Strengthening Social Security Act, with Congresspersons  (D-CA) and  (D-NJ), which would increase benefits for current beneficiaries, eliminate the cap on how much of an individual's earnings can be paid into Social Security, change the benefits formula to increase payments by about $70 a month, and adopt a higher cost of living adjustment called CPI-E, designed to reflect the cost of healthcare for seniors.\n\nAlso in the 113th Congress, Honda authored H.R. 4202, the CPI-E Act of 2014, which would apply CPI-E to index federal retirement programs other than Social Security, to include programs such as civil service retirement, military retirement, Supplemental Security Income, veterans pensions and compensations, and other retirement programs with COLAs triggered directly by Social Security or civil service retirement. As a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Budget Taskforce, Honda also inserted this CPI-E provision into the FY 2015 CPC Budget, entitled the \"Better Off Budget.\" Honda said during floor debate on the CPC budget, that the provision was intended to be a first step to applying CPI-E to all federal retirement programs, including Social Security.\n\n\nHonda has been a leading voice to overhaul and improve the current VA system. As an appropriator, he worked with his colleagues in both parties to not only call for change, but to provide funds to create a new electronic health record program between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. He is also working to ensure that the government makes use of the knowledge and experience of health information technology experts, such as those in Silicon Valley, to ensure this new platform will eliminate the current backlog of claims. Honda helped obtain $2.8 million in grants to aid homeless and at-risk veterans and their families in Silicon Valley.\n\n\nHonda has a 100% legislative score from  and from the  (NARAL) and has been a long-time supporter of pro-choice legislation and for women's health due to his voting record. Honda has supported Paycheck Fairness Act and voted for the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act  the first piece of legislation to be signed by President Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nDuring the debate over the new health care bill, Honda voted against the  to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which would have prohibited the use of federal funds \"to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion\" except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. The amendment was dropped by its co-author Stupak in exchange for an executive order promised by President Obama which would address the Stupak-Pitts concerns.\n\nIn 2013, Honda voted for the reauthorization of the  (VAWA), which included updated protections for Native American women, immigrant women, and provided specialized support and resources for LGBT, religious and ethnic communities. VAWA reauthorization also included the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which Honda has also supported. Honda introduced the Domestic Violence Judicial Support Act of 2013, which would strengthen the judicial programs that comprise the basis of VAWA. To support full implementation of the Obama Administration's Executive Order 13595 and the U.S. National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security, and to secure Congressional oversight, Honda introduced the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2013, along his female colleagues Congresswomen , Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Niki Tsongas.\n\n\nIn July 2014, Honda introduced a bill to ban level 3 body armor for anyone not in law enforcement. In September, it was referred to the subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. This bill would ban anyone except law enforcement and military personnel from obtaining level 3 body armor. He was quoted as saying: \"We should be asking ourselves, why is this armor available to just anyone, if it was designed to be used only by our soldiers to take to war?\".\n\n\nIt has been alleged that Honda and key members of his congressional staff violated House rules by using taxpayer resources to bolster his 2014 re-election campaign. In September 2015, the House Ethics Committee decided to extend the review of the matter after the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) released its report on the allegation. The OCE report noted \"there is substantial reason to believe that Representative Honda improperly tied official events to past or potential campaign or political support.\" As of August 8, 2016, the House Ethics Committee had not decided whether Honda violated House rules.\n\n\nHonda's wife, Jeanne, was a kindergarten teacher at Baldwin Elementary School in San José. She died in 2004. He has two children: Mark, an aerospace engineer, living in Torrance, and Michelle, a marketing and communications manager, in San Jose. Michelle is the mother of one daughter and two sons.\n\nIn February 2015, Honda's announcement that he is a \"proud ''jichan''\", or grandfather, of his transgender granddaughter Malisa, gained regional, national, and international coverage.\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress, (retrieved July 29, 2009)}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress,\" (retrieved July 29, 2009)}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress,\" (retrieved July 29, 2009)}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress,\" (retrieved July 29, 2009)}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress,\" (retrieved July 29, 2009)}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress,\" (retrieved January 22, 2014)}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress,\" (retrieved January 22, 2014)}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"United States Representative in Congress,\" (retrieved 18 June 2016)\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The proposition was a  to legalize   which was approved by voters in 1996. Kubby was known as a  patient who relied on medical cannabis.\n\nKubby authored two books on drug policy reform: ''The Politics of Consciousness'' (1995) and ''Why Marijuana Should Be Legal'' (2003). He was the  candidate for  in , receiving 0.9% of the vote. In 2008, he declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's  and received significant support for the nomination, but was eliminated after the second ballot.\n\nKubby died in  on November 20, 2022, aged 75.\n\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 23, Kubby began experiencing symptoms of  and . He was diagnosed with malignant , a rare, fatal form of adrenal cancer.  Kubby underwent surgery to remove a tumor in 1968, 1975 and 1976. This last time, his medical records show that the cancer had metastasised to his liver and beyond. All other patients with this diagnosis have had a 100% mortality rate within five years.   His physician, Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, a specialist from the , monitored his condition and treated him with conventional therapies, including , until referring him to the  in 1981 for yet another surgery and .\n\nFor the next 25 years, Kubby maintained that he was able to control the symptoms of his disease solely by smoking marijuana and by maintaining a healthy diet. His original doctor, an expert on this condition shocked to learn he was still alive, said,  \"In some amazing fashion, this medication has not only controlled the symptoms of the , but in my view, has arrested its growth.\"\n\n\nIn the , Kubby was the Libertarian candidate for , receiving 0.9% of the vote. The same year, he became national director of the . Two months after the election, Kubby's home was raided by the  sheriffs department. The officers seized 265 marijuana plants and a small quantity of  from a guest bedroom, and Kubby was arrested.\n\nKubby was a contender to be the Libertarian Party's vice presidential candidate in the . The Libertarian Party requires the vice presidential candidate to be nominated by the delegates just as the presidential candidate is selected. Kubby was opposed by fellow Californian , and by  of Pennsylvania. After no candidate received a majority on the first ballot, Krawchuk withdrew his name from the ballot and endorsed Olivier, who then defeated Kubby by a vote of 418 to 338.\n\nOn August 20, 2006, at the , Kubby announced his intention to seek the Libertarian Party's nomination for . The Federal Election Committee (FEC) issued candidate ID numbers for Kubby personally and for the Kubby for President Committee on September 18, 2006. He had since campaigned at various community and Libertarian Party events and launched a campaign web site. He later endorsed  for president, in the event that Ron Paul is able to secure the GOP nomination. Meanwhile, Kubby was continuing to actively campaign and has made Internet history with the first animated presidential campaign video. On May 25, 2008, Kubby did not gain his party's nomination and was eliminated after the second ballot at his party's national convention.\n\n\nCannabis Sativa, Inc. announced on June 30, 2014, that Kubby was named chairman of the company. This was following Cannabis Sativa's acquisition of Kush Inc., previously owned by Kubby and the owner of the first patented marijuana plant.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, Kubby was instrumental in the drafting and passage of California , ''The Compassionate Use Act of 1996''.   Despite the victory of Prop. 215, Kubby and his wife, Michele, were arrested, jailed and prosecuted, under the false claim that the voter initiative provides only an  and that it is to be used by only \"seriously ill patients.\"\n\nIn the 1996 Voter's Handbook, the Official Title and Summary prepared by the Attorney General Dan Lungren, the State of California informed voters that a 'YES' vote on Prop. 215 would exempt patients and defined caregivers from criminal laws. In fact, the very first sentence of the official title and summary clearly states: \"Exempts patients and defined caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician from criminal laws which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of marijuana.\"\n\nNowhere in the official Title and Summary does it say anything about an affirmative defense, or any limits or restrictions.\n\nFurthermore, in the official Analysis of Proposition 215 by the Legislative Analyst, the voters were told, \"No prescriptions or other record-keeping is required by the measure.\" In addition, the voters were reminded by the Legislative Analyst that this initiative also covered any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.\"\n\nThe  Sheriff's Department had been sent an anonymous letter alleging that the Kubby's had been operating a major grow operation from their residence, and began an investigation. Kubby learned of this, and invited them to inspect the grow room, by passing a note through his own household trash, which the police had begun searching. That note, \" ... addressed to law-enforcement personnel, advising them of Steve Kubby's use of medicinal marijuana, maintenance of a garden, possession of no more than 3.5 pounds of pot and his cancer condition,\" was removed from his trash and entered as evidence by the prosecution.\n\nIn 1999, Kubby and his wife Michele were arrested and faced trial for growing his own cannabis in his home, though he was entitled to do so legally on behalf of himself and his wife, also a licensed cannabis patient. Calling his arrest the \"Scopes monkey trial of medical marijuana,\" Kubby remained defiant in his support of the Compassionate Use Act. He maintains that the prosecution was politically motivated, implicating then-Attorney General 's office. Lungren had been aggressive in resisting the implementation of Proposition 215, to the point of issuing instructions to s on how to cross-examine cannabis patients so as to undermine their claim of sanction.\n\nIn jail for 72 hours after the arrest, Kubby was deprived of medical marijuana and became seriously ill. His blood pressure shot up to dangerous levels. USC Medical Center's Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, who made Kubby's original diagnosis, wrote a letter to the court explaining Steve's condition and warning the judge what could happen if Steve was further deprived of cannabis.\n\n\n\nKubby described their ordeal in his official complaint,\n\n}}\n\nMichele Kubby won an acquittal on all charges. Steve Kubby's trial, owing to one juror's refusal to acquit, received a mistrial on all the cannabis charges, which were eventually dropped. The jury also voted to convict on a possession charge involving a psilocybin mushroom stem and a few peyote buttons (a felony) found in their house.  Kubby was sentenced to 120 days in jail.\n\n\nIn 2001, exercising his right to appeal the conviction for peyote possession, Kubby obtained the court's permission to move to  with his wife and two children. Kubby and his advisors were concerned that police and prosecutors were determined to prove their theory that he did not really need medical marijuana and would find a way to arrest and incarcerate him.  After the Kubby family had been in Canada for a few months Kubby alleged the terms of his appeal were changed without his knowledge or consent by two judges. Kubby claimed that he was wrongly reclassified as a fugitive.\n\nKubby appealed his fugitive status through the Canadian legal system for five years. Among the arguments made in fighting the appeal was the likelihood that he would be denied access to cannabis in custody and risk death from his illness. This fear was later proved to be well founded as confirmed by the Placer Jail medical staff who found blood in his urine and other evidence of severe hypertensive trauma, which Kubby still suffered from.\n\nDr. Joseph Michael Connors, an expert in the area of adrenal cancers, testified at the Canadian extradition hearing about Kubby's medical condition:\n\n}}\n\n\n\nAfter numerous appeals, Kubby was asked to leave Canada under a \"conditional Departure Order\" within 30 days, which he did. He arrived in , , on Thursday, January 26, 2006, accompanied by his attorney Bill McPike, and was immediately arrested. Although it had been arranged that Kubby would surrender at the Placer Superior Court on Tuesday, 31 January, he was removed from the Alaska Airlines jet on arrival by San Francisco police officers at the request of sheriff's officials in Placer County and taken through secure areas of the airport, bypassing the supporters gathered to greet him.\n\nHe was held in  Jail in , where, according to  spokesman Dale Gieringer, he was becoming rapidly ill. He was transported to  Jail Friday afternoon and was arraigned at 1 p.m. in Dept. 13 of Placer County Superior court Tuesday, 31 January. Gieringer reports that Placer County Jail granted Kubby access to , a  synthetic which lacks the  which have been shown to modulate  levels.  Kubby, with the Marinol, immediately went into cardiac arrest due to the lack of subsequent cannabinoids which modulated the known issues. Michele Kubby reported that the Marinol helped in specific quantities, but that her husband could tell subjectively that it will not be effective in the long run.\n\n\n\nShe also describes her husband's conditions of confinement,\n\n\n\nIn January, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting Kubby and calling for his immediate release from jail. On March 6, 2006, Kubby was released early from jail for good behavior. At a March 14 hearing, he was re-sentenced to another 60 days in jail for violating his probation by not returning from Canada in 2001, and began serving the sentence on Wednesday, March 15. Kubby was released on April 5 after serving only 22 days of the 60-day sentence, his time reduced because of jail overcrowding.\n\nIn July 2007, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCPthe drug czar's office) used testimony submitted to Congress to misrepresent the position of Kubby, claiming that he no longer supports medical marijuana.\n\nIn written testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, Dr. David Murray, ONDCP's Chief Scientist called medical marijuana advocates \"modern-day snake oil proponents,\" sneered at medicines that make patients \"feel good,\" and claimed that laws okaying medical marijuana in a dozen states have led to \"abuse, confusion, and crime.\" Then, to further buttress his argument against the therapeutic use of the herb, he added:\n\n\n\nKubby suffered from almost constant nausea while on Marinol, he wrote, adding that Murray took his sentence about Marinol out of context. The paragraph from which it was extracted reads as follows: \"During that time I experienced excruciating pain, a vicious high blood-pressure crisis, passed blood in my urine and I lost 33 pounds. However, there was also good news. I learned that Marinol is an acceptable, if not ideal, substitute for whole cannabis in treating my otherwise fatal disease. Now I am a free man and I am profoundly grateful to be alive and to have friends and supporters such as you.\"\n\nWhile conceding that Marinol can be effective for treatment of hypertension and would allow him to travel briefly without medical marijuana, it does not allow him to have an acceptable quality of life, Kubby said.\n\n\"Please help me squash this deceptive and dangerous misrepresentation of my true feeling on this matter by the ONDCP,\" Kubby wrote. \"It just shows how desperate they are that they must mislead people in this way. And just so there is no question about this, let me be clear: Whole cannabis is not only the best medicine for me, it is the only medicine that has kept me alive during the 32 years that I have continued to live, in relatively good health, despite a terminal diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma.\"\n\n\nKubby was a strong supporter of  the  and . He advocated for legal , , , a  foreign policy, immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from the , , and the elimination of federal individual . He was opposed to most governmental regulations, programs, and federal . He also opposed the ,  and the .\n\nDuring a 2009 interview with a  newspaper, he criticized the health care plan presented by President , saying: \"Obama is ready to spend trillions of dollars to create a government health program. I have a far simpler plan that will genuinely help patients and save them and the government all those trillions of dollars: reschedule marijuana to reflect reality and authorize its use for medical purposes.\"\n\n\n\n* \n* ''''\n* \n* \n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n*  at \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The following year, he received a Teaching Credential from CSU in Hayward, then worked for his father's roofing company and as a fork-lift driver at Ward's before getting his first job with the Legislature on the staff of Assemblyman Robert W. Crown. In 1986, Lockyer graduated with a  from  . (He returned to the classroom in 2009 as a non-tenured college professor, teaching undergraduate courses in American State Politics at the  and the .) With his early legislative experience, Lockyer began his own political career as a School Board member of the , as chair of the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee, and California coordinator of Senator .\n\n\nLockyer, who lives in Hayward and Long Beach, California, was married in April 2003 to public service attorney , a former Alameda County Supervisor, with whom he has three children: a son born in 2004; and two twin sons, born in December 2015. By an earlier marriage, he also has an adult daughter who is an attorney at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n\n\nLockyer first won a State Assembly seat in a Special Election of September 4, 1973, following the accidental death of his political mentor, Bay Area Assemblyman . He served in the legislature for the next twenty-five years, more than half that time in the state senate, where, in 1994, he was chosen by his peers to be President Pro Tem, the most powerful position of the upper legislative house.\n\nIn his spare time, Lockyer attended law school classes in Sacramento and received a  degree from the , .\n\nAs legislator, Lockyer won close friends on both sides of the partisan aisle, including , Republican Minority Leader of the state senate, who would long remember Lockyer's skill at compromise and consensus-building., and Democratic Speaker of the Assembly , who recalled that, by the time Lockyer left the legislature in 1998, \"Capitol insiders took his prolific effectiveness for granted.\"\n\n\nAs a freshman legislator in 1974, Lockyer wrote the first legislation to provide state funding for emergency oil spill decontamination. During his legislative career, as a close ally of environmental pressure groups like the  and the , he wrote other environmental laws, including the first state regulation of trucks hauling toxic substances on California roads and highways, which preceded federal policies adopted by the EPA.\n\nLockyer considered his greatest environmental achievement to be his 1987 bill to create a Bay Trail, which he envisioned as an eventual 500-mile-long hiking and cycling path, a continuous recreational corridor, with adjacent bayshore parks and protected natural habitats, that would entirely encircle San Francisco and San Pablo Bays. Requiring city, county and regional cooperation, the Bay Trail marked its 20th year in 2009 with 293 miles so far open to hikers, bicyclists, joggers and walkers. As nominal \"father\" of the Bay Trail, a segment of the shoreline had been named in Lockyer's honor.\n\n\nIn 1984, Lockyer sponsored the State's first \"hate crimes\" legislation which, as later amended, provided that \"no person...shall by force or threat of force, willfully injure, intimidate, interfere with, oppress, or threaten any other person in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him or her by the Constitution or laws of this state or by the Constitution or laws of the United States because of the other person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender, or sexual orientation, or because he or she perceives that the other person has one or more of those characteristics.\" Later, as Attorney General, Lockyer was responsible for coordinating enforcement of this statute by local law enforcement.\n\n\nOn September 10, 1987, while Lockyer chaired the State Senate Judiciary Committee, he and Speaker of the Assembly  met at  in Sacramento with representatives of bitterly competing special interests – insurance companies, trial lawyers, doctors and manufacturers – to formalize their agreement to \"the most sweeping changes in California's civil liability laws in decades\". After many days of painstaking negotiations, these warring interests had accepted a compromise bill that included \"a drastic restriction in product liability laws offset by fee increases for lawyers prosecuting medical malpractice cases. Doctors got promises that protections already in place against lawsuits would not be touched. Insurance companies won a reprieve from threatened regulations gaining momentum in the Legislature.\" This compromise had already been worked out; the dinner was meant to ratify a future \"peace pact\" among all the concerned parties to abide by the compromise. Lockyer, who had acted as mediator during the earlier negotiations, scribbled the terms of the \n\"pact\" on a restaurant cloth napkin, and so ended a political war. The compromise bill was then ramrodded through the assembly and state senate on the last night of that year's legislative session, and was signed into law by Republican governor .\n\nThough it was only Lockyer's \"theatrical touch\" of writing the agreement on a napkin that made it especially memorable, the \"napkin deal\" became legendary in the State Capitol. Proudly reproducing the original napkin on a poster titled \"Tort-Mania 1987\", Lockyer and Brown regarded the special interests compromise and conciliation they had arranged as a great legislative accomplishment. \"The public is better served\", Lockyer said at the time, \"when these groups are trying to mend rather than tear the fabric of society\".\n\n\nFederal legislation signed by  in 1996 required California to enact “welfare-to-work” legislation to help welfare recipients move from government assistance to employment and “self-sufficiency”. The resulting establishment of a new  (California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids) program had a major effect on the state budget, propelling difficult negotiations between the Democratic legislature and conservative Republican governor . As Senate President Pro Tem, Lockyer was a key negotiator in these private negotiations, which, he later recalled to journalist Daniel Weintraub, produced the State's “last... old-fashioned balanced budget,”, linked to a bi-partisan billion-dollar tax \"mega-deal\", a complex legislative package that cut state income taxes for middle class Californians.\n\n\nElected attorney general in 1998 after 25 years as a legislator with a small, close-knit staff, Lockyer took on an executive position that demanded both policy direction and managerial acumen. The Department of Justice, of which he was “chief executive officer”, had some 5,000 employees, 1200 of whom were attorneys handling a caseload of 100,000 lawsuits – the equivalent, in the private sector of the seventh largest law firm in America. Much of the department's effort was as a service agency for the staggering demands of California's local law enforcement – 90,000 officers at 70,000 police terminals expecting split-second response from a state telecommunications network that received three million inquiries a day; background and fingerprints checks of a million annual applicants for positions as police officers, teachers and day-care providers, and “live scan” of another million and a half fingerprints taken during booking arrest, plus searches connected with 750,000 outstanding warrants for wanted suspects. This required Lockyer to radically restructure and reinvigorate his department with high-tech efficiencies and policy innovations to modernize the relationship between the attorney general and the law enforcement community. Having grown up in the Berkeley 'Sixties atmosphere of anti-police rhetoric, Lockyer, now described by the press as the state's \"Top Cop\", insisted on attending memorial services for more than 50 officers killed in the line of duty during his years in office.\n\nAt the same time, Lockyer steered the Justice Department to a new legal activism that reflected his liberal values in such areas of litigation and regulation as civil rights and anti-trust enforcement and consumer and environmental protection. He became one of the two most prominent state Attorneys General in the nation, rivaled in media attention only by New York's . The two men were personal rivals as well, once nearly coming to blows after \"screaming expletives at each other\" at a Los Angeles convention of the National Association of Attorneys General. That organization elected Lockyer its president in 2003.\n\nAs attorney general, Lockyer sometimes had to defend official positions he found objectionable, such as asking the courts, in 2004, to invalidate San Francisco same-sex marriage licenses which conflicted with state law, though he personally supported the right of   which brought him under fire from both social conservatives and gay activists. On other occasions, the positions Lockyer defended matched his own, as when he defended California's 1996 legalization of  against federal attacks by the  Administration. Lockyer found this particularly satisfying as he had come to strongly support \"compassionate use\" of Marijuana after living through his mother's and younger sister's deaths from .\n\n\nIn grappling with the sheer size and range of the state's law enforcement responsibilities, Lockyer confronted, with varying success, several challenges that required his department to give new high-technology support to law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn 1996, the state legislature had passed California's version of \"\", which required authorities to make publicly available registration information provided to local police by former child molesters, rapists and others sex offenders after being released from custody. But the public could only access this information about  living in their communities by visiting a police station or calling a 900 toll-line number, until Lockyer's Department, with legislative approval in 2004, launched a public website allowing Internet users, by a simple search, to find personal details about more than 60,000 past sex offenders, and to locate, through an interactive map, such offenders living in their neighborhoods. The website faced initial complaints that, despite the State's efforts to prod local Police to provide accurate data, some of the information was outdated; and that, as the ACLU contended, there were too few restrictions to protect the civil liberties of those who had already completed their . But the website did draw enormous public interest, receiving over 186,000,000 \"hits\" from more than 16,000,000 individual users in its first year of operation.\n\nAnother large-scale bio-tech challenge was expansion of State Crime Lab facilities to process DNA genetic samples taken from convicted felons, aiming to create the largest state-run DNA criminal data-bank in the country. Since 1988, California law had required blood samples taken from felons convicted of specific sex and violent crimes, in the hope of reinvigorating often “cold” investigations of unsolved crimes. When Lockyer took office, 100,000 of these blood samples were sitting in cold storage, still waiting to be analyzed and compared to DNA taken from crime scene evidence. In June 2001, Lockyer announced that with an expanded DNA Lab staff and new equipment, the backlog of unanalyzed blood samples had been eliminated, leading to identification of suspects in homicide cases more than 15 years old.\n\nBut then a voter-approved measure of 2004 that allowed police to gather DNA, not just from convicted violent criminals, but from anyone arrested, even without charge or conviction, for any felony, violent or otherwise led Lockyer himself to express reservations. \"I personally wouldn't have put arrests in the measure,\" he said, adding that he would also have made it simpler for innocent people to get their information removed from the files – a complaint of civil libertarians who raised the specter of innocent people being kept in the same database as convicted armed felons. This also proved an administrative nightmare, as the backlog eliminated in 2001 had reappeared as a new backlog of 287,000 by 2006, forcing new efforts, with inadequate financial resources, to meet the television-viewing public's rising expectations of law enforcement efficiency.\n\nAfter a  company unveiled a new technology for \"coding\" individual bullets, Lockyer sponsored the first legislation in the country which would have required all handgun (but not rifle) ammunition sold in California to be engraved with a unique serial identification number. \"We are losing too many of our young people to seemingly random shootings and anonymous killers,\" said Lockyer. The bill \"will strip criminals of their anonymity and give law enforcement evidence it can use to quickly and effectively solve more gun crimes.\" The  and other gun rights groups – already at odds with Lockyer over enforcement of State prohibitions against semi-automatic rifles – strongly condemned the plan, saying criminals could easily obtain unmarked ammunition and that the whole process would create a costly enforcement bureaucracy. Manufacturers also opposed the measure as economically disastrous, since the engraving machines would cost up to half a million dollars each and would make virtually obsolete tens of millions of dollars in existing manufacturing equipment. The bill died in the legislature.\n\n\n\nOf the many actions taken by Lockyer's staff against corporate fraud and malfeasance, the most prominent were related to the state's energy crisis that began in the summer of 2000, marked by rolling blackouts, brownouts and the billions of dollars in price hikes that appeared on consumers' electrical bills. It later emerged that the \"crisis\" stemmed in part from illegal practices by energy corporations such as the now-defunct . The exposure of these hidden offenses began in August 2000 when Lockyer created an Energy Task Force to launch the State's first investigation of alleged  by power companies.\n\n'''' scoffed at million-dollar rewards offered by the Attorney General's office for information about illegal conduct by energy powers, dismissing the allegations as unsupported by clear evidence. But such probes eventually led to some five billion dollars in brokered settlements by Enron and a half dozen other corporations which admitted to \"gaming\" the State's deregulated energy system.\n\n\nAs Attorney General, Lockyer, during the  of 2001, achieved some notoriety for his public quip, \"I would love to personally escort [Enron CEO]  to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a ed  who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey'\". This remark was widely condemned as an endorsement of . Lockyer later apologized for the statement in a letter to the '''', saying, \"My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. ... I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of Californians.\"\n\n\nOn September 20, 2006, Lockyer filed a lawsuit against what his office referred to as \"the big six automakers\" for their alleged contributions to . Initial reaction was mixed, with some environmental groups being supportive, and an auto industry trade calling it a 'nuisance suit'. A similar suit in  had been dismissed by a federal court.\n\nThe California suit was  on September 17, 2007, with the court saying that \"The adjudication of plaintiff's claim would require the court to balance the competing interests of reducing global warming emissions and the interests of advancing and preserving economic and industrial development.\"\n\n\nWhile Attorney General, in 2006, Lockyer and his staff conducted a criminal investigation into the   scandal to ascertain whether or not the investigators authorized by Chairman  to discover the source of leaks from within the company illegally obtained the phone records of HP board members and journalists. Charges were subsequently brought against Dunn, which were dismissed by the court in 2007 (while Dunn was battling terminal cancer) in the \"interests of justice\".\n\n\n*'''' (Restrictions on semi-automatic firearms)\n*'''' (\"Three-strikes\" criminal sentencing)\n*'''' (Same-sex Marriage)\n\n\n\n\nAn initiative to recall newly re-elected Governor  qualified for the ballot in July 2003, with a special election, scheduled for October, to include both a referendum on the recall itself and a list of candidates vying to replace Davis if the recall succeeded. With some arm-twisting by U.S. Senator , all the potential Democratic candidates, including Lockyer, agreed not to run, in the hope that this would strengthen Davis' campaign to defeat the recall.\n\nAt the start, it appeared that the strongest Republican candidate would be former Los Angeles Mayor , who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor the previous year. Lockyer, at the start of August, publicly warned Davis and his political consultants against a repeat effort to sabotage Riordan's candidacy by negative attack ads: \"If they do the trashy campaign on Dick Riordan&nbsp;... I think there are going to be prominent Democrats that will defect and just say, 'We're tired of that puke politics. Don't you dare do it again or we're just going to help pull the plug.'\"\n\nFive days later,  announced that he would run as a Republican in the recall election. Lockyer and Schwarzenegger had been casual friends since Lockyer's state senate years, when the actor had chaired the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and the two men had together toured charter schools in southern California. Later, Lt. Governor  announced he would become the only prominent Democrat to place his name on the recall ballot.\n\nOn October 7, by a decisive vote, Davis was recalled, and Schwarzenegger was elected to replace him. Two weeks later, at a UC Berkeley post-mortem conference on the election, Lockyer made the surprise announcement that while he had voted against the recall, he had also voted for Schwarzenegger, the first time he had ever voted for a Republican in a state election. He explained that he was \"tired of transactional, cynical, deal-making politics,\" and that, for him, \"Arnold represented... hope, change, reform, opportunity, upbeat problem solving\". He added, \"I hope I haven't been conned\". Many fellow Democrats and feminists reacted bitterly to Lockyer's surprise announcement, which proved damaging to his future political aspirations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy a year into Schwarzenegger's governorship, Lockyer increasingly felt the Governor's performance was disheartening, marked by inexperience, lack of strong political conviction, and personal braggadocio. In a 2005 interview, Lockyer criticized Schwarzenegger's leadership style as demonstrating an \"arrogance of power\" with the \"odor of Austrian politics\", alluding to the Austrian-born Governor's upbringing in a country with a \"long history\" of \"elite...autocracy\".\n\nSoon after the gubernatorial recall election, Lockyer, barred by term limit laws from seeking a third term as attorney general, began contemplating his own run for governor in . In January 2005, he tentatively announced his candidacy for governor: \"the one and only office that has held abiding interest for me since I left the Legislature&nbsp;... It's the job I want, not only because I think I'll be a great executive, but because I think that I can and will lead the best campaign you've ever seen, a winning Democratic campaign of ideas, ideals and inspiration to stake out a great future for California.\" Lockyer changed his mind four months later, saying that while he felt strongly about the need to improve education and transportation, and to address \"the growing disparity\" between the state's rich and poor, he was unwilling \"to spend the next 10 years of my life\" in the daily \"partisan fighting\" that plagued governors of both parties. In June 2005, he announced he would instead run for state treasurer. He was elected to that office in November 2006.\n\n\nAs treasurer (and ex officio trustee of  and , the two largest public employee pension funds in the United States) Lockyer tried to use the influence of his office in the aid of various environmental causes. These attempts included:\n\n* Expanding the \"Green Wave\" environmental initiative first proposed by Treasurer  in 2004 to a multibillion-dollar investment in renewable energy\n* With statutory authority of the Treasurer's California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA), exempting new \"Zero Emission Vehicle\" manufacturers, such as electric automobile startup , from sales and use tax on the purchase of equipment used in California manufacturing.\n* State purchase – the first by any governmental body in the US – of \"\" issued by the  to finance Climate Change projects in developing countries\n* Providing a $48 million loan guarantee program to help California truckers comply with new diesel emission regulations put into force by the \n\nBased on such state programs, Lockyer also sponsored federal legislation (H.R.3525,“Private Activity Bonds for Clean Energy Projects”) introduced in July 2009 by California Congressman  to provide tax-exempt bond financing nationally for private sector Renewable Energy projects, Zero-emission vehicle purchases, and \"green\" manufacturing facilities.\n\n\nIn the fall of 2008, with the economy faltering, the legislature very belatedly passed what ''Los Angeles Times'' political columnist  called \"another atrocious, short-sighted, gimmicky budget that set a record for procrastination\" and \"wreaked havoc all across California among small business vendors, healthcare centers and nursing homes that couldn't be paid by the state until a budget was enacted.\"\n\nLockyer was also critical of the budget, describing its budgetary provisions to Skelton as \"banana republic financing\", based on accounting gimmicks (that \"give gimmicks a bad name\"), \"phony inflated estimates of revenue\" and a \"boondoggle\" of \"massive\" corporate tax breaks at a time of mounting State deficit.\n\nIn 2009, it was discovered that the state faced a $25 billion deficit, following a sharp drop in tax revenues.\n\nAs negotiations began to revise the state budget, Lockyer tried to convince U.S. Treasury Secretary  to provide a guarantee for state bond payments. \"A fiscal meltdown by California ... would surely destabilize the U.S., if not worldwide financial markets,\" Lockyer wrote to Geithner on May 13. The Obama Administration declined the request.\n\nEarlier, Lockyer warned the legislative conference committee that private lenders would be leery of any more \"smoke-and-mirrors accounting tricks\" and that lawmakers would have to rely heavily on spending cuts to balance the budget: \"It seems to me that the kind of budget we will require before the end of June is almost entirely  cuts&nbsp;... My suggestion to you is don't delay the pain. It's going to be awful, but just get it done. It's going to be worse if it doesn't get done.\"\n\nLockyer was also quoted as telling Democratic legislators that, \"fair or not\", angry voters blamed them for \"12 years of flowing red ink\". \"Why don't you start with the realization that probably none of you are going to be back here next year?\", after the 2010 elections. \"You're not going to get reelected. Just put the politics out of your brain&nbsp;... That's a very liberating thought, and with it you can get a lot done.\"\n\nWhen the legislature failed to pass a balanced budget before the start of the new fiscal year on July 1, 2009, State Controller John Chiang began issuing IOUs to some state creditors. Lockyer suggested having a respected intermediary mediate between the Republican governor and the Democratic-controlled legislature. Republican State Senator  scoffed at the idea, saying, \"No caucus is going to go with that... I'm not going to vote for new taxes just because some mediator told me to.\"\n\nThroughout the budget crisis, Lockyer warned that an impasse would increasingly raise the costs of short-and long-term state borrowing, ultimately as much as an additional $7.5 billion in interest over the next 30 years. On July 6, with no budget agreement yet concluded, Fitch Ratings downgraded California's bond rating to BBB, just one notch above the dividing line between investment grade and speculative grade \"junk\" bonds. A Lockyer spokesman estimated that this downgrade alone would represent an immediate \"hit of hundreds of millions of dollars\" in higher credit costs.\n\nAs California continued to issue IOUs to cover $350 million in short-term debt, the formal standing of California bonds continued to decline. Moody's joined Fitch in cutting the State's debt rating (though still three levels above \"junk\" status), because of \"increasing\" risk to debt service payments. And a London firm which tracks speculative \"credit default swaps\" ranked California ninth in the world among the 10 governmental entities most likely to default on their financial obligations. A Lockyer spokesman called this assessment \"ludicrous\", and Lockyer himself continued to insist, as he had done throughout the crisis, that the threat of default was \"infinitesimally small... short of a thermonuclear war.\"\n\nTwo days later, on July 16, Lockyer stated, “I call on the Governor and Legislature to focus exclusively on what it takes to bring this year’s budget back in balance, honestly and immediately. I urge them to...quit adding or resurrecting endless ideological debating points, and to stop using budget negotiations to score points with political allies or against partisan opponents.\" He added that the state's credit rating was moving \"closer and closer to the junk pile... If our credit rating sinks to junk status, the state will find the door to the infrastructure bond market locked shut\".\n\nOne Democratic insider stated that by this \"tongue-lashing of legislative leaders\", the \"ever-blunt\" Lockyer \"didn't win...any friends in the Capitol\".\n\nFour days after Lockyer's remarks, the Governor and legislative leaders finally announced they had reached agreement on a complex budget plan which combined spending cuts with various accounting maneuvers.\n\nA month later, Standard and Poor's removed California bonds from its \"credit watch list\", indicating that while the bonds still had a negative outlook, they were not \"under threat of an imminent downgrade\". Lockyer was optimistic about this \"positive development&nbsp;... It reflects confidence that the budget solution adopted by the governor and legislature gets us on the right track...\"\n\n\nWhen the  corporation announced it would close the  auto plant in , after its long-time partner in the facility, , pulled out of the partnership, Lockyer appointed a blue-ribbon commission that publicized the adverse economic consequences of plant closure and the unemployment of several thousand workers, and pleaded with Toyota to reconsider. The company refused.\n\nBut then Lockyer, working behind the scenes, helped arrange a new partnership at the NUMMI plant between Toyota and , an electric car company, which he had assisted in the past through the Treasurer's \"Green Wave\" investment policies.\n\n\n\nThree of Lockyer's predecessors as state treasurer – , , and  – had lost gubernatorial campaigns, and Democratic pundits considered the treasurer's job a much \"smaller bully pulpit\" which did not provide a good springboard to higher office.\n\nDespite persistent rumors that Lockyer, who had earlier accumulated a $10 million political war chest, might be a \"dark horse\" possibility for governor , he expressed no interest in mounting a campaign to succeed Schwarzenegger. When asked about the possibility, Lockyer stated that he saw no chance of winning a primary election battle with former governor  (his successor as attorney general), who eventually emerged as the unchallenged Democratic nominee and went on to win the general election. Lockyer also said he preferred spending time with his family. \"You kill yourself being a Governor\", he joked, \"and then maybe you get a new aqueduct named after you\".\n\nIn an article probing Schwarzenegger's political unpopularity in his final months in office, George Skelton, after quoting Lockyer's reflection on the fickle electorate (\"Our state voters have very high expectations of what government can do. And their haste to criticize is very high\") opined that Lockyer \"might have been governor himself if he were more ambitious and photogenic, and sometimes less blunt\".\n\nHaving faced no opposition in the Democratic primary, Lockyer, using the attention-getting campaign slogan, \"Straight Talk, No Bull#*+!\" was re-elected for a final term as state treasurer in the November 2010 election, defeating a Republican state senator from Orange County, , and receiving more votes that year than any elected official in the United States. He was endorsed by the '''', '''', '''', '''', and the '''', which concluded that \"the Hayward Democrat has done well at a number of jobs over several decades, from the Legislature to attorney general. But as state treasurer for the past four years, he has really shone, maturing to near-statesman stature...\"\n\n\nIn 2012, Lockyer was seriously considered for chancellor of the  system, but the position went instead to a professional educational administrator. Then, unable to run for a third term as treasurer due to , he expressed a tentative interest in running for  in 2014, but instead announced his retirement from elected office.  He is now  to the Boston-based international law firm, Brown Rudnick, advising clients in the firm's Orange County office on government law and strategies.\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n*  '''Official state site'''\n*  '''Official campaign site'''\n*  2006 campaign contributions\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He went to  then graduated ''magna cum laude'' from the  in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English. Hertzberg earned his Juris Doctor from  in 1979.\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Hertzberg was an associate at the Beverly Hills law firm of Fulop, Rolston, Burns, & McKittrick. He and his father later formed the Hertzberg & Hertzberg law firm. The younger Hertzberg left in 1985 and sued his father over the firm's assets in 1986, seeking $1 million in punitive damages. After his father's passing in 1987, the case was settled as part of the estate.\n\nAfter Hertzberg retired from the State Assembly in 2002,  recruited him to full partnership at , formerly Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw. Hertzberg left Mayer Brown in 2014, after being sworn in as a State Senator. Shortly after being elected to the California State Senate in November 2014, Hertzberg was hired as a \"\" government affairs attorney with the Los Angeles law firm Glaser Weil. Hana Callaghan, director of the , has raised concerns over potential conflict of interests, as the firm services many clients who are affected by state legislation. In December 2017, he and Glaser Weil mutually agreed to the suspension of their relationship, following sexual assault allegations against State Assemblyman , who was represented by Glaser Weil.\n\n\nHertzberg experience with politics begin at 19 as a driver for State Senator , who ran in the  race, in 1974. There he built his networks within the Latino political circles, including , , and . Hertzberg did legal work for Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina. He was later appointed to the California State Board of Pharmacy.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1994, Hertzberg contemplated running for the 40th Assembly District, which encompassed  to  in the San Fernando Valley, but never announced his candidacy.\n\nIn 1996, Assemblywoman  of the 40th Assembly District . In the March Democratic primaries, Hertzberg ran against Francine Oschin, aide to man . According to the California Political Almanac, Hertzberg \"racked up a sheaf of endorsements and raised well over $200,000 for the primary.\" He won the primary with 72% of the vote. In the November general election, Hertzberg had a 59–31% victory over Republican Ron Culver.California Secretary of State: Statement of the Vote, November 1996 General Election. \n\nIn 1998 and 2000, Hertzberg was re-elected with 69% and 70% respectively.California Secretary of State: Statement of the Vote, November 2000 General Election\n\n\nTerm limits in the Assembly meant a large influx of new members with every new session. Hertzberg created the California Assembly Program for Innovative Training and Orientation for the Legislature (CAPITOL) Institute with Assemblyman  in 2000 to educate first time legislators and their staff. They offered training on a variety of topics: including ethics, legislative deadlines, key personnel at the capital, voting procedures, restrictions, and committees. After his tenure as Speaker ended, the succeeding Speaker  named the Capitol Institute after Hertzberg.\"Hertzberg U,\" by Kathleen Les, ''California Journal'', June, 2000. Hertzberg also created the Speaker's Office of International Relations and Protocol.\n\n\nIn November 1999, Antonio Villaraigosa announced his resignation as Speaker of the Assembly the following April to run for Los Angeles mayor in 2001 and immediately endorsed Hertzberg as his replacement. Assemblymen  and  of San Francisco and  of Sylmar were seen as potential opponents for the position.\n\nOn April 13, 2000, Hertzberg was unanimously elected by a voice vote as the 64th Speaker of the California State Assembly. In 1996, when Hertzberg first ran for the Assembly, the Democrats had 38 of 80 seats. By November 2000, when Hertzberg was directing the Assembly Democratic campaigns, his party was up to 50 seats and he was the last Speaker to gain seats until the Obama landslide of 2008.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hertzberg temporarily shut down the State Assembly and created the bipartisan Legislative Task Force on Terrorism to combat potential threats to California's food and water supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nA steady series of fundraising scandals, where members of Mayor James Hahn's Administration were investigated by a grand jury for allegedly awarding city contracts to campaign contributors, and the general attitudes towards Hahn prompted many people to join the mayoral race in 2005.\n\nHertzberg termed out of the California State Assembly in 2002 and transitioned back to private law practice. He launched his mayoral campaign in June 2004 with an extensively produced website at ChangeLA.com. The website attacked Hahn's leadership and encouraged readers to donate and interact with Hertzberg. It has been likened to Vermont Governor 's digital campaign in the , which elevated Dean's name recognition from unknown governor to apparent frontrunner. Hertzberg told the ''Los Angeles Times'' that he while he made more money doing business and conducting his law practice, he ran out of a sense of civic duty. However, half of Los Angeles city voters did not know much about Hertzberg.\n\nHertzberg was the first to launch a TV campaign in the race, which featured a giant image of him towering over a city full of problems.Levey, Noam N.

''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved May 22, 2010. Hahn's supporters ran negative mailers, linking Hertzberg and Villaraigosa to  and drug dealer  during their time in the State Assembly. An analysis by the ''Los Angeles Times'' showed that Hertzberg was popular among Hahn's base, which included San Fernando Valley residents, conservatives, moderates, and Jewish voters. However, he struggled with young, black, and Latino voters, polling less than 5% per group and well behind his opponents. Hertzberg also won twice as many precincts as Hahn but fell short when Hahn's negative ads decreased his support in the Valley. Hertzberg placed third in the primary election after Hahn and Villaraigosa, with the most votes of any candidates in the San Fernando Valley. An editorial in the ''Los Angeles Times'' claimed a dull run-off debate between Hahn and Villaraigosa made them \"miss Bob Hertzberg and his outsized ideas\". After missing the run-off election, Hertzberg endorsed Villaraigosa. Villaraigosa would go on to defeat Hahn 59% vs 41%.\n\n\nHertzberg ran as a moderate Democrat. His platform included the breaking up the , calling the District's 50% dropout rate the biggest threat to the city's future, despite not having any control over the department as mayor. Governor  did not endorse any candidates, despite his close working relationship with Hertzberg, probably due to souring attitudes towards him by the city's Democratic majority. However, he has expressed support for Hertzberg's plan to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District, although he did not specify which parts. He opposed raising taxes for more police officers.\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2013, Hertzberg announced his candidacy for the Senate seat representing . His announcement was followed up by a lieu of endorsements by state officials, including , , , and , and local representatives, including  and . He credited his time co-founding the Think Long Committee with billionaire Nicholas Bergguen and successfully drafting legislation as motivation to re-enter the political scene. He placed first in the June 2014 primary elections with 63.1%, with Republican candidate Ricardo Benitez placing second with 29.1%. Hertzberg won the general election in November 2014 with around 70%.\n\nHe defeated Republican challenger Rudy Melendez with 78.1% of the vote in the November 2018 election, the highest of any California Senate seat that year. When asked about his legislative priorities in 2018, he listed tax reform, , simplification of government forms, refining the bail reform law, and updating disaster related infrastructure. He was sworn in for his second and final Senate term on December 3, 2018.\n\n\nIn December 2018, Senate President Pro Tempore  appointed Hertzberg Senate Majority Leader for the 2018–19 Legislative Session.\n\n\nIn 2018, Hertzberg introduced a bill to identify automated social media accounts as bots with full disclosure. He has said that the bill was aimed at preventing , particularly in politics and advertising. Early drafts of the bill would have required undisclosed bots to be removed and covered all bots, not just political and commercial ones. These provisions were later removed after backlash from the  and the , whom were concerned about potential conflicts with the .

The bill has yet to be passed.\n\n\nDuring his first term in the state senate, Hertzberg, with , helped pass SB10, which would end  in California by allowing judges to determine if a defendant could be released before a trial. It received broad Democratic support and one Republican vote from . The bill has received editorial endorsements from major newspapers across the state, including the ''Los Angeles Times'', '''', ''Sacramento Bee'', '''', and ''''.\n\n\nHertzberg opposed SB 10, a bill that would enable city and county governments to allow for denser housing near transit-rich areas, jobs-rich areas or urban infill sites. Hertzberg described the bill as \"a way to destroy single-family neighborhoods.\" He was the sole member of his committee to oppose the bill.\n\n\nIn August 2020, Hertzberg voted against the bill AB-345, which would have required a minimum setback distance of 2,500 between s and public areas where children are present, in a 5–4 decision. The bill's author, State Assemblyman , has said that there was strong opposition from oil and gas industry trade unions, who the ''Los Angeles Times'' has noted are major supporters of Democratic candidates. Hertzberg said that he opposed the bill because it was redundant as Governor  had already signed another bill in 2019 with similar intentions of setting up buffer zones. This decision prompted the local chapter of the youth-led environmental activism group  to protest outside of his home in .\n\nIn 2022, Sen. Hertzberg partnered with the Governor’s office to secure the passage of multiple historic climate measures, including SB 1137 which created a set back of 3,200 feet for all oil wells and established a first in the nation ban on single use plastics with Sb 54. Both bills had languished in the legislature for years before Senator Hertzberg got them both passed in his final year in office.\n\nIn early 2023, after leaving office, Hertzberg was named as a senior fellow to the , an alliance of climate leaders focused on supercharging efforts to decarbonise some of the world’s highest-emitting industries in the next 10 years.\n\n\n\nAs of 2022, Hertzberg is running to represent the third district on the . Hertzberg's son ran to fill his father's old seat, but lost to .\n\n\n\n\nOutside of his law practice, Hertzberg has been active in the alternative energy industry. In January 2008, '''' named Hertzberg as one of the \"50 People Who Could Save the Planet\" for his investments in solar energy. Hertzberg co-founded Solar Integrated Technology in 2003 in . He sold his shares in the company to run in the 2005 Los Angeles mayoral race. It later debuted on  of the London Stock Exchange in May 2004. There was an increased interest and demand to invest in clean energy companies following the activation of the  in 2005, with billions invested the following year in private and public markets. Hertzberg co-founded the investment firm Renewable Capital in 2006.\n\n\nHertzberg co-founded , based G24 Innovations (G24i) in 2006 with the intentions of selling lightweight s to the African market. In February 2009, G24i had $100 million in venture funding. The company's main focus was on silicon-less solar panels with technology rights they bought from Swiss scientist  that allowed for light capture at lower rates but at any light level. They moved into an abandoned  factory and it opened August 2011 with help from the  and UK Government. The company has gone on to win several industry awards and has transitioned, and found success, selling solar strips to power iPad keyboard cases. G24i went into  in December 2012 and was later acquired in 2013 by solar cell company G24 Power in .\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Hertzberg chaired California Forward whose self-declared mission is \"to work with Californians to help create a \"smart\" government – one that's small enough to listen, big enough to tackle real problems, smart enough to spend our money wisely in good times and bad, and honest enough to be held accountable for results.\"\n\nIn 2010, billionaire  and Hertzberg founded the Think Long Committee for California. The Committee describes its mission to \"advocate a comprehensive approach to repairing California's broken system of governance while proposing policies and institutions vital for the state's long-term future.\"\n\nHertzberg chaired the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, in 2004 and 2011.\n\n\nAfter Arnold Schwarzenegger's election as California governor in the 2003 recall election, Hertzberg served as both a formal and informal advisor to Schwarzenegger. In 2003, Schwarzenegger appointed him to his Transition Committee and Hertzberg helped guide the passage of the new governor's \"Economic Recovery Package\" through the legislature that allowed the state to weather the financial crisis of 2003–04. According to ''The People's Machine'' by Joe Matthews, Schwarzenegger then offered Hertzberg the position of Chief of Staff, nicknaming him \"Hertzie.\"The People's Machine: Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Rise of Blockbuster Democracy by Joe Matthews Hertzberg chose to stay in the private sector but did advise Schwarzegger to \"build a thoroughly bipartisan government.\" Hertzberg wrote in the ''Los Angeles Daily News'' that his advice was: \"Take the initiative to go and meet with members of the Legislature, Democrats and Republicans alike. Sit in their offices, meet with them as human beings, and learn to work with them.\"\n\nAfter finishing a close third in the 2005 mayoral election, Hertzberg served as the chair of Mayor-elect Villaraigosa's Transition Team.\n\nIn 2009, Hertzberg also served as the co-chair of the Transition Team for newly elected Los Angeles City Attorney, Carmen Trutanich.\n\n\nHertzberg calls himself a \"New Democrat\" in the mold of Bill Clinton, who is both pro-business and pro-labor.  He is a proponent of , , and a non-partisan State government.\n\nHertzberg has been given the nicknames \"Huggy\" and \"Hugsberg\" for his habit of offering embraces to colleagues, employees, voters and even opponents. The journal ''Capitol Weekly'' has repeatedly named him one of the Top 100 influential people in Sacramento, writing in 2011: \"Bob Hertzberg is one of those hyper-kinetic, Type-A personalities who love politics for its own sake. He's a former Assembly speaker, an L.A. lawyer and a go-to guy for his ideas on political reform. Amazingly, he was a sort of adviser to former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he continues to be an insider Democrat with his fingers in lots of pies.\"\n\nAssemblyman Darrell Steinberg commented on Hertzberg's role as a link between Schwarzenegger and the state legislature, saying that Hertzberg would report \"what the Democratic legislative line was  where we couldn't go and where we were willing to go. And he had the trust of the principals on both sides, which helped quite a bit.\" In his autobiography ''Total Recall'', Arnold Schwarzenegger relates how he went to meet with Speaker Hertzberg in 2002 to seek support for his successful \"After-school\" initiative:\"\n\n\n\n\nHertzberg came under public scrutiny for his lingering embraces as two female lawmakers and a former female legislator complained that the intimate embraces made them uncomfortable, according to an interview by the ''Sacramento Bee''. Two of the women said that Hertzberg hugged them again even after they had asked him to stop.\n\nFormer California Assemblywoman  said that after she told Hertzberg she wasn't a hugger, he grabbed her anyway. \"It was like dirty dancing. It was gross,\" she told the ''Sacramento Bee''. \"I was really just kind of horrified, because you don't do that. You just don't do that. It was so out of context and inappropriate.\" The Assemblywoman also described Hertzberg's actions in one hug as \"clearly a sexual thing, rather than a friendly thing.\" The Assemblywoman told Hertzberg: \"Don't touch me.\" Hertzberg responded by grabbing the Assemblywoman, pinning her arms by her side and thrusting his groin against her pelvis. Hertzberg then restricted the Assemblywoman from moving away, forcing prolonged torso-to-torso contact despite her shouting at him to let her go.\n\nThe former California Assemblywoman declined to meet with lawyers hired by the California Senate to investigate her allegation concerning Hertzberg in stating that \"I don't want any involvement with these people,\" and \"I don't respect how they've handled it.\" While the California Senate ordered him to stop hugging co-workers after an investigation determined that his behavior made two female legislators and a male sergeant-at-arms uncomfortable, the summary report of the investigation released by outside lawyers concluded that Hertzberg's hugs were \"not sexual in nature.\" According to the ''Los Angeles Times'' report detailing the conclusion of the investigation, the report found that Hertzberg likely hugged the Former Assemblywoman on one occasion, but it said \"the record did not support her assertion that he hugged her on multiple occasions or that he did so after she asked him to stop.\" Hertzberg was reprimanded.\n\n\nThe issue came up in the media again when a man connected to the bail industry set up a \"Victims Hotline\" website and video in December aimed at collecting stories about the Senator – just days after the allegations surfaced. A video circulating on Facebook was found to be produced by backers of California's bail industry; an industry Hertzberg is trying to reform. Adama Iwu, one of the founders of the  movement in the Sacramento Capitol, added that it appeared that the bail agent was taking advantage of the situation \"for some kind of political gain.\"\n\nAnother California lawmaker, former state Senator Tony Mendoza, who had been suspended amid a sexual misconduct investigation sued the California Senate. The Latino lawmaker argued that race was playing a role in his treatment, noting that Hertzberg, who is Jewish, had not been asked to step aside despite allegations he inappropriately hugged people. The former California Assemblywoman who complained about Hertzberg's conduct also questioned why Hertzberg had been able to continue his work as a lawmaker during the investigation of his conduct when the other California lawmaker (who is Latino) was barred from showing up in the building as allegations against him were being investigated.\n\n\nHertzberg has three sons. He met   while working for the . They divorced in 2005.\n\nWhile a student at the University of Redlands, he wrote a 400-page handbook titled, ''A Commonsense Approach to English''. In 1983, he coauthored a manual on real estate law, ''California Lis Pendens Practice'', published by the University of California, with a second edition in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* (2012)  by Think Long Committee for California\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was endorsed by  in October 2012. The new district was significantly more Latino than its predecessor; Latinos now made up almost half its population. Ruiz appealed to them by running Spanish-language ads. He was elected with 52.9% of the vote to Bono Mack's 47.1%.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Bono Mack \"accused Ruiz of being a far-left radical and repeatedly referred to Ruiz's 1997 arrest in Massachusetts while participating in a Thanksgiving Day protest against the treatment of American Indians.\" She stated that Ruiz \"dressed in Aztec warrior colors\", had taken part in these Thanksgiving Day protests for six years, and \"encouraged people to smash Plymouth Rock.\" At a debate, Bono Mack asked \"Dr. Ruiz, who are you?\"\n\nAt an October 2012 press conference, Bono Mack campaign officials released an audiotape on which Ruiz expressed solidarity with convicted police murderer  and read a letter of support for , who was convicted in 1977 of murdering two FBI agents in . On the tape, supposedly recorded at a 1999 Thanksgiving rally, Ruiz read aloud a letter to Peltier from a Marxist leader, \".\" It read in part: \"Leonard Peltier's most serious crime is that he seeks to rescue in the past, and in his culture, in his roots, the history of his people, the .

I believe we need to heal our wounds and put people above partisanship and solutions above ideology.\"\n\n\n\nIn October 2017, soap-opera actress , a pro-Trump Republican, announced that she would challenge Ruiz in 2018. Criticizing Ruiz for not passing any \"meaningful\" legislation, Brown said, \"For the first time in the history of our great country, we are not leaving something better behind for the next generation.\" Brown, known for '''', runs a design firm and has co-managed an  farm with her husband.\n\nRuiz was reelected with 59% of the vote.\n\n\n\nRuiz was reelected, defeating Republican challenger Erin Cruz, an author and a candidate for the  in , with 60.3% of the vote.\n\n\n\nIn April 2013, Ruiz voted for , which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies.\n\n\nIn May 2013, Ruiz voted against repeal of the .

In 1996 he said he would begin to donate large sums of money from his $100,000 salary and  his extensive financial portfolio to fund city projects within his district if he were reelected.

She has advocated for a  increase and a plan to forcibly appropriate foreclosed s from banks. She has led an ongoing effort to restrict the municipal influence of Richmond's largest employer, the , and to refashion its environmental obligations.\n\n\nMcLaughlin was born into a  family in . The middle child of five daughters, her father was a  carpenter and her mother was a factory worker and housewife.\n\nDuring the 1980s, McLaughlin was an activist with the  solidarity movement and a steering committee member of  (Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador). She also played an active role in the North Star Network, a national networking effort to unite progressives, and in coalition-building efforts with . She continues to work as a social activist in the , , , and  movements.\n\nMcLaughlin earned a Bachelor of Science degree in  from  and took graduate courses in psychology and education at  and . \n\n\nShe has worked as a postal clerk, teacher, caregiver for the elderly, and tutor/clinician for children with . She has also worked in the capacity of support staff for various  health and educational organizations. She has lived in Richmond since 2001.\n\n\nMcLaughlin is a founder of the  (RPA), a non-partisan progressive group in western , composed of members of the , , and the , as well as independent voters. In 2004, the RPA ran a slate of candidates to replace a municipal government that was widely seen as dysfunctional: \"There are vacancies in virtually every major administrative department,\" wrote the '''', \"and the city is operating with an interim city manager, city attorney, police chief and fire chief. The city has no library director and no parks and recreation director, and no one running its housing authority.\" Together with RPA colleagues, McLaughlin won her first election to the Richmond City Council in November 2004.\n\nIn Richmond, McLaughlin's  has found her involved in many local struggles in support of both social and . She opposed the , the criminalization of the homeless, and Chevron's Richmond Refinery tax perks. She has also been involved in an ongoing effort to stop development on the  shoreline and supports the .\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, McLaughlin decided to challenge Richmond's incumbent mayor . She was elected on November 7, 2006 by a 242-vote margin over Anderson. At the time, her victory made Richmond the largest city in the country with a Green Party mayor. McLaughlin won a second term in office in the 2010 municipal election. She overcame a well-funded offensive to unseat her during the re-election campaign.\n\nUnder McLaughlin's mayoralty, the \"small, blue-collar city best known for its  refinery has become the unlikely vanguard for anticorporate, left-wing activism\". From early in her career, McLaughlin gave tangible governmental support to workers' s as a means of fighting unemployment. She was a strong proponent of , a proposed municipal  that was met by determined, well-funded resistance from the  and other business interests. She also spearheaded a 2014 effort to raise Richmond's local  to US$12.30 per hour. The raise provided impetus to the broader statewide minimum wage movement.

Even by 2013, nearly half of all home mortgages in the city were \"underwater\", with owners owing more than their houses were worth.  On average, homeowners with mortgages were indebted for about 45% more than the original value of their homes.  McLaughlin mounted a unique and highly controversial effort to gain control of the mortgages. The city, in partnership with a private financing company, would seek to purchase mortgages from banks at  and then allow the homeowners to refinance for a minimal fee. If the banks refused, the city would seize the mortgages using the legal power of .\n\nDefending the plan, McLaughlin said mortgage seizures were necessary to alleviate \"an unjust set of circumstances\" facing homeowners after the , and the use of eminent domain would be justified for the common good by preventing  caused by abandoned foreclosed homes. The city thus has a right and duty to prevent foreclosures, as well as a legal necessity to protect its citizens: \"People were tricked. They were sold these bad loans\" which were far in excess of their value, and made Richmond \"a community being victimized\". In March 2013, the City Council voted 6–1 in favor of partnering with a San Francisco firm, Mortgage Resolution Partners (MRP), to begin enactment of the plan.\n\nOpponents in Richmond countered that the plan would help only a small subsection of mortgage-holders, while two banks,  and , immediately filed lawsuits against the city. Arguing that it was an illegal use of eminent domain, the banks also warned that it would severely damage the U.S. mortgage industry by encouraging other municipalities to do the same. Other cities, including , , and  were all said to be considering mortgage seizure, although only Richmond publicly pursued the plan. Undaunted, McLaughlin told the press in August 2013 that her administration was confident that it would prevail in court against the banks. The following month, after heated public debate, the City Council again voted to back McLaughlin and proceed with the plan.\n\n\nMcLaughlin had a contentious relationship with the  during her political career. The multinational energy corporation maintains a massive, century-old oil , and it has long dominated the city's economy and politics. After the RPA took root, however, the shift in government caused friction with Chevron, particularly after the McLaughlin administration fought it in court over the payment of various taxes. A major fire at the refinery in August 2012 led to another hotly contested lawsuit, this time for \"willful and conscious disregard of public safety\".\n\nChevron spent $1.2 million in 2012 to oppose two Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA) City Council candidates who were critical of the company and to support three that the oil company considered supportive. That was the one year that the RPA candidates lost. McLaughlin herself was not up for reelection that year, but strongly supported the two RPA candidates with whom she shared progressive values.\n\n\nEven after her mayoralty ended, Chevron continued to oppose her vigorously, \"spending some $3 million – an unheard of amount for a small, local election – to campaign against McLaughlin and her slate\" in the . She was nonetheless elected to the City Council in 2014 and served in this role until July 18, 2017, when she resigned to seek a higher political office.\n\nMcLaughlin is not without critics such as the '''', which referred to her and the RPA in a 2016 editorial as \"the biggest deniers of the city's fiscal crisis.\"\n\nShe and her fellow RPA candidates Eduardo Martinez and  all won by wide margins in 2014 despite having been heavily outspent by their opposition. The 2016 City Council elections were noticeably quieter in tone, with no financial input from Chevron, according to campaign finance reports. Two other RPA candidates, Melvin Willis and Ben Choi, won open seats creating a RPA majority in the City Council.\n\nIn 2016, McLaughlin changed her political party registration from Green Party to NPP (\"No Party Preference\") so she could vote for U.S. Senator  in the California presidential primary.\n\n\nIn June 2017, McLaughlin declared her candidacy for  in the . Her independent campaign refused to accept any corporate contributions.\n\nAlthough McLaughlin ran with no party affiliation, her endorsements include the , the Peninsula chapter of the , the , , the , the , and the .\n\nThe hotly contested primary race saw over $10 million raised by campaigns, \"far more than the $7.6 million that candidates raised for the entire election cycle the last time the seat was open in 2010\". In a crowded field of eight, McLaughlin won 263,364 votes (4.0%).\n\n\nA chronicle of the McLaughlin administration's rise and legacy, ''Refinery Town: Big Oil, Big Money, and the Remaking of an American City'', was published in 2017 with a foreword written by Bernie Sanders. This was followed in early 2018 by McLaughlin's own memoir, ''Winning Richmond: How a Progressive Alliance Won City Hall''.\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n* \n*  (2013) in ''''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She is a former candidate for  for  in the November 2018 election and the  in the  in . She supports making significant changes to  and to the current super-majority voting rule in the Sacramento legislature. In 2002 she garnered nearly a half million votes in her run for California state controller. At the last 2010 gubernatorial debate in California, which excluded all third party candidates, Wells was arrested upon attempting to enter the building to watch the debate. \"The San Jose Mercury News\", Wednesday October 13, 2010\n\n\nLaura Wells was born and raised in . She earned her BA from  in 1969, where she was a scholarship student, majored in foreign languages, and was elected to the . Wells earned a Masters of Education at , and later worked in finance, business analysis and computer programming.\n\nWells has resided in California for more than 30 years. She has one daughter, Natalia, born in Oakland, now a musician and graduate of the . Wells is engaged to Charles Goodwin, a former probation counselor in the juvenile division.\n\n\nWells has served in numerous county and state-level leadership positions in the Green Party of California since she registered with the Green Party in 1992. She was a founding member of the Green Party County Council in Alameda County (1992–94; 2002–04) and co-founder and managing editor of the national Green Party newspaper, ''Green Focus'' (2002–2004).\n  \nIn 2006, Wells served on the executive committee of the \"IRV for Oakland\" () campaign while running for state controller. IRV is a voting system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, rather than selecting only one candidate, a method which eliminates the so-called  in elections.  Wells helped garner support for IRV from U.S. Representative  of Oakland and other local representatives of most political parties in Oakland, including Greens, Libertarians, Peace and Freedom, Republicans, and Democrats.  In November 2006, IRV achieved 69% voter approval. On January 5, 2010, the Oakland City Council voted to adopt IRV for its mayoral and council elections.\n\nIn 2002 and 2006, Wells ran campaigns for , receiving 419,873 votes in 2002, the most ever for a Green Party candidate in a statewide partisan race in California. Greenparty.org In 2009, Wells appeared on the Fox News program \"Your World\" several times to discuss tax fairness in California.\n\nWells has also participated in ten international delegations to  and  to study innovations in participatory  and new s, and has broadly worked in a range of volunteer and professional capacities for community and labor organizations, including Pesticide Action Network (North America), Women's Economic Agenda Project, and  United Healthcare Workers (West). She co-founded Green Focus, a party newspaper.\n\n\n\nIn January 2010, Laura Wells announced her candidacy for governor of California in .Chang, Jack.  \"The Sacramento Bee\" Saturday January 16, 2010  Wells won the Green Party primary on June 8, 2010 with over 78% of the votes.\n\nWells' campaign emphasized the California budget and tax issues, particularly , passed during 's tenure as governor, which she says must be changed, in part because it primarily benefits  over individuals.  In a position paper on Proposition 13, Wells wrote:\n\nProp. 13, in 1978, was promoted to California voters as a way to reduce taxes and to stop fixed-income seniors and others from losing their homes due to escalating property taxes. Since then, the bulk of the \"tax relief\" goes places the voters never intended--giant corporations. Corporate properties are rarely re-assessed since corporations don't die and seldom sell.\n\nWells also favored lowering the margin needed to pass a budget and raise taxes in the state from two-thirds to a simple . She supported increasing funding for education, and the use of a 'split-roll tax' to keep cap residential property taxes while allowing higher property taxes for businesses.  In a January 2010 interview with ''The Sacramento Bee'' discussing her views on taxes and the budget in California, Wells stated:\n\nThe two parties, the Democrat and Republican parties, do not address the root causes of the problem,\" Wells said. \"That's off the table for them. ... To get what we want and to have the revenue that pays for it we need to have a budget that makes sense.\n\nWells has also addressed the difficulty that third parties have in running candidates for state elections:\n\n... she says [the difficulty for third parties] is a result of the \"locked-down\" system the Democrats and Republicans have put in place. As a case in point, she said she had to pay $6,000 for a 300-word ballot statement when she ran for state controller in 2006, a fee she said blocks minor-party candidates from running.\n\nWells supports a  solution for California, and if given the opportunity, says that she would gladly sign SB 840 (the Single Payer bill introduced by State Senator Sheila Kuehl) into law. Wells also supports the use of clean, , local energy, including publicly owned utilities,  (CCA) and localized (distributed) electricity generation, instead of nuclear power or .  Wells also opposes government  of large corporations and banks and proposes the creation of a State Bank for California which could partner with local banks and credit unions, and potentially improve their ability to lend.  Other Green Party candidates, such as the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney, also support a State Bank proposal.\n\nWells has been endorsed by San Francisco for Democracy and numerous elected officials, described at her campaign website.\n\n\nOn October 12, 2010, Laura Wells was given a ticket to watch the California gubernatorial debate at  by a friend of hers and used it to enter the building. Wells was initially allowed in, but upon being recognized as the Green Party gubernatorial candidate, she was approached by security and asked to surrender the ticket on the grounds that it was not issued to her, but to her friend.  When she refused to surrender the ticket, she was handcuffed and taken from the building and put into a police car, and arrested for \"trespassing at a private party\". She was later released.  Wells stated:\n\nRepublicans and Democrats will go to any lengths, even arresting candidates, to keep the truth from California voters.  There are solutions, but voters aren't being allowed to hear from independent candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n election, 2018\n}}\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #3333FF; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    |  ()\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 159,751\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 99.3\n|-\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #17aa5c; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    | Laura Wells ()\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 832\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0.5\n|-\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #E81B23; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    | Jeanne Marie Solnordal ()\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 178\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0.1\n|-\n|- class=\"vcard\"\n| style=\"background-color: #FED105; width: 2px;\" |\n| class=\"org\" style=\"width: 130px\" | \n| class=\"fn\"    | James M.

He was part of a co-ordinated three-person slate supported by the local Republican Party in an attempt to gain a Republican majority on the nine-member board. He ran unopposed for the District 5 seat being vacated by the retiring councilmember . District 5 includes the neighborhoods of , , , , , , ,  and .

Kersey is also the city's representative to the California League of Cities. He has been called San Diego's \"open data and infrastructure guy\".\n\nKersey was elected to a second term in June 2016. In December 2016, he was appointed council president ''pro tem''. He held in this position until December 2017, when he was succeeded by Barbara Bry.\n\nIn April 2019, Kersey declared that he was leaving the Republican Party to become an independent, stating that he would work toward bipartisan solutions to the city's issues during the remaining two years of his term.\n\nKersey was unable to seek re-election to the city council in 2020 due to term limits. He left office on December 10, 2020, and was succeeded by .\n\n\nKersey was chosen to chair a newly formed infrastructure committee to address the city's backlog of needed repairs which had built up over decades.\n\nAs chair of the committee, he spearheaded a plan to address the City of San Diego's approximately $2 billion backlog of infrastructure projects. The plan called for assessments of city infrastructure, streamlining of processes, gathering of neighborhood input and the creation of a long-term infrastructure investment plan.\n\nWith Kersey's leadership, the city completed its first-ever comprehensive sidewalk assessment as well as its first multi-year capital plan, which identified $1.7 billion in unfunded infrastructure projects over the next five years.\n\nKersey also sponsored an ordinance to create a neighborhood input policy which was approved in July 2013. The policy formalized community input as part of the infrastructure prioritization process.\n\nKersey authored Proposition H in 2016 devoting over a billion dollars in future sales tax growth and pension savings towards repairing the city's infrastructure without raising taxes. Named \"Rebuild SD\", San Diego voters passed the measure with 64% of the vote.

The measure proposed restricting benefits for elected city officers, restricting lobbying and campaign activities of elected city officers and removed the requirement that councilmembers set their salaries and those of the mayor and city attorney, providing instead that their salaries be set as percentages of the salary set by the State of California for Superior Court judges. The measure also banned council members or the mayor from lobbying the city for two years after leaving office, outlawed city-paid mailers during election campaigns and did away with free use of the city's luxury boxes at Petco Park or at the city's Mission Valley stadium.

At the age of 30, she was the youngest person to be elected to the board of supervisors, the first woman to be elected from the First District, and the first Vietnamese-American county supervisor in the .\n\nShe won her supervisor seat following a historic special election where two  candidates received half of the total votes cast in a field of 10, separated from each other by only 7 votes. She was sworn in on March 27, 2007, after a lengthy court battle. She won a full, four-year term in 2008 in another historic election when all three major candidates were Vietnamese Americans. She was reelected to a third term in 2012 and left the Board in 2014 after winning her first State Senate term.\n\nPrior to her election to the Board of Supervisors, she served as a  City Council Member and at age 28, was the youngest person ever elected to that body, until Kim Nguyen (no relation) was elected at 25 in 2016.\n\n\nNguyen was born in , , on May 1, 1976, roughly one year after the  on April 30, 1975. Her family joined millions of others in becoming  when she was five, coming to  in 1981. They first lived in , but settled in  in early 1990s. She attended the , at first to become a  but later majored in  after she was inspired by then-Supervisor . She is married to Tom Bonikowski Jr., with whom she has two sons, Thomas III and Timothy.\n\n\n\n\nThe election of Supervisor  to the  in the 2006 election left his supervisorial seat vacant. Ten candidates filed for the seat in the February 6, 2007 special election, including three Vietnamese Americans, who were all Republicans. While the 1st District Supervisorial seat is officially non-partisan, the leading candidate was man  (who had just left office two months before), a Democrat who had the full support of the labor unions. While the Republican Party did not officially endorse a candidate, most party leaders were backing  City Councilman Carlos Bustamante.\n\nWith three Vietnamese-American candidates, the large Vietnamese-American community who comprise a quarter of registered voters in the First District was galvanized. Janet Nguyen's main opponent,  Trustee Trung Nguyen, had the support of State Assemblyman . Issues that the candidates discussed included , one that county supervisors do not have the authority to affect. The debate was particularly heated within the Vietnamese-American community, with accusations flying back and forth between the two Nguyen camps. Trung Nguyen was insulted as a \"\" and his campaign photoshopped Trung Nguyen in a photo next to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger while Janet Nguyen was criticized for not being fluent in . Pundits speculated that the three Vietnamese-American candidates would split the Vietnamese-American vote, allowing Umberg to easily win the election.\n\nWith high absentee voter turnout among the Vietnamese-American community, it became clear on election night that Janet Nguyen and Trung Nguyen were leading. Umberg and Bustamante were in third and fourth place, respectively, and quickly conceded defeat. At the end of the night, Janet Nguyen was leading by 52 votes. However, when all the votes were counted on the following day, Trung Nguyen was leading by seven votes. Janet Nguyen requested a recount, and the final result was 10,919 votes for Janet Nguyen and 10,912 votes for Trung Nguyen. Janet Nguyen was certified the winner. However, Trung Nguyen's lawyers filed a lawsuit challenging the recount, alleging that the Registrar of Voters improperly voided votes for him and awarded votes to Janet Nguyen in the recount. The Board of Supervisors postponed inaugurating Janet Nguyen pending the lawsuit. On March 26, she was named the winner, winning by just 3 votes.

However, Janet Nguyen won 56.6% of the vote in the June 2008 election, avoiding a November run-off.  Councilwoman Dina Nguyen, a fellow Republican who received the strong support of Assemblyman  and his machine (including former candidate, Trung Nguyen), won only 27.7% of the vote while Democratic activist Hoa Van Tran won 15.7% of the vote. \n\nIn 2021, she supported the recall of the current governor of California, . On December 21, 2021, Nguyen announced that she would be a candidate for state Senate District 36, which is newly created.

Republican leaders quickly rallied around Nguyen while the state Democratic establishment rallied around former state Assemblyman .

In a 1990 statewide poll of prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges, ''California Lawyer Magazine'' named Rogan as one of the state's most effective prosecutors.\n\nLater that year Governor  appointed the 33-year-old prosecutor to be a judge of the Glendale Municipal Court. Rogan was California's youngest sitting state court judge at the time of his elevation to the bench. During his service on the municipal court (1990–1994) Rogan presided over thousands of civil and criminal cases. In 1993 his colleagues elected him presiding judge of their local court.

His father was a member of the  and his mother worked for  as a  on their . His parents divorced when he was three or four years old, and he and his siblings relocated with their mother, living in Michigan, Minnesota, and Missouri before settling in , before moving to California when he was 11 years old. He graduated from  and enrolled at . He served as , but dropped out of college without graduating to take a job as a community organizer for the  Local 721.\n\nIn 2010, Steve Neal, the member of the  for the ninth district, hired Richardson as his  and tasked him with organizing community groups in the district. In 2014, Neal ran for the , and Richardson was elected to the city council to succeed him. In 2015, he rolled out the  to Long Beach. He was elected vice mayor of Long Beach in 2016. Richardson returned to college through remote learning in 2020, and completed his  from Cal State Dominguez Hills.\n\n\n\n\n\nRichardson announced his candidacy for the  in January 2022, upon 's retirement to run for the . He received the endorsements of Senator , Governor , and the outgoing Mayor Garcia.\n\nIn the June 7 primary election, Richardson and fellow councilor Suzie Price received the most votes, but since no candidate received a majority of the votes, the election advanced to a runoff. Richardson would win the runoff election on November 8, 2022, becoming the  of Long Beach.\n\n\nRichardson was sworn in on December 20, 2022.\n\n\nThe city of Long Beach, California uses a  system. This means that policy-making authority lies within an elected governing body: the city council. Mayors can, however, make certain appointments.\n\nIn 2022, Long Beach voters approved the formation of a new Police Oversight Commission. To serve as its first commissioner, Richardson appointed former  Inspector General Francine Kerridge. Her duties include investigating instances of unnecessary force and broader trends within the department.\n\nRichardson cited increasing diversity as a major influencing factor in his appointment decisions. He has appointed 32 commissioners, 53% are women and 59% are members of racial minority groups.\n\n\n\n\nThe Long Beach Housing Promise was proposed by Rex Richardson and approved by City Council members in April 2023. Richardson launched the initiative to create more affordable housing opportunities for students and their families and to identify more opportunities for homeless prevention programs in Long Beach. In creating this program, Richardson worked directly with the president of California State University, Long Beach, the president and superintendent of Long Beach City College, and the superintendent of the Long Beach Unified School District.\n\n\nThe Grow Long Beach Initiative is a long-term plan to expand Long Beach's economy. The purpose of the initiative is to find alternative revenue sources in order to help reduce the city's long standing reliance on fossil fuels and oil. The initiative focuses mainly on two industries: tourism and aerospace and aviation. Even so, the city is exploring other highly profitable industries such as healthcare, the Port of Long Beach and its supply chain, education, hospitality, and the arts. One of the recent developments of this initiative is the construction of a Hard Rock Hotel in downtown Long Beach. On November 13, 2023, Richardson formally announced the Hard Rock Hotel project. Richardson said the project aligns directly with the Grow Long Beach Initiative, because the construction of the hotel will help to increase tourism and transform downtown Long Beach into a thriving entertainment district.\n\n\nOn November 14, 2023, Richardson released a comprehensive three-phase plan to address public safety concerns in downtown Long Beach. The purpose of the initiative is to combat serious public safety issues facing downtown Long Beach, including trespassing, drug dealing and lewd behavior. The initiative places a strong emphasis on mental health issues. More specifically, the initiative includes the creation of the Neighborhood Safety Bike Team, increased patrol officers in downtown Long Beach, specialized drugs officers directed toward areas with high crime rates, and the establishment of enhanced Quality of life officers.\n\n\nThe West Side Promise was introduced by Richardson in his 2024 budget reveal, in which he proposed a 10-year investment plan to identify ways to improve West Long Beach's housing supply and economy, while maintaining climate resiliency. West Long Beach has experienced some significant hardships in recent years, including a lack of basic necessities like banks, full-service grocery stores, and pharmacies. West Long Beach is also very close to Interstate 710 and the Port of Long Beach, which causes its residents to experience many health issues. In order to remedy these issues, Richardson's West Side Promise's plans to drive economic and equitable investments, increase open spaces, and work to decrease pollution in West Long Beach.\n\n\nRichardson has made many efforts to reshape Long Beach, California’s economy through his budget proposals leading up to 2024. To support this approach, Richardson has drafted his proposal for Long Beach revolving around Elevate 28, a billion-dollar plan to improve the Long Beach area. The $3.2 billion proposal focuses on helping the homeless and preparing the community for the 2028 Olympic Games. The final budget for this fiscal year was established and planned to begin on October 1. After many revisions, this budget was focused on allocating funds toward the upcoming Olympics, infrastructure, and more. More key motivations of this program were to upgrade the population’s quality of life - aiming to extend life expectancy and decrease homeless rates around the city by finding safe and supportive residences for the homeless. This budget also incorporates strategies to inject money into smaller locally owned businesses to improve the local community around Long Beach, the hope is to support small businesses and spur more tourism.\n\nDuring the $3.2 billion budget proposal, Rex Richardson has advocated for a plan that is meant to supply more resources to the city. This 10-year plan is called the West Side Promise. This promise is meant to fight against the environmental racism that has plagued the city for years, and Richardson believes this will be a beneficial investment for the city. Some key attributes of this program include developing a new cultural center and new parks in the area. The hope for this program is to improve Long Beach's quality of life by providing them with basic necessities and resources. To make this program successful, the city would need funding from private and public industries to provide these resources for the city.\n\n\nRichardson and his wife, Nina, have two daughters.

Now in a largely Latino district, Molina announced her candidacy for the special election. She was mainly challenged by Larry Gonzalez, a member of the Los Angeles Board of Education. In the election, she defeated Gonzalez and two others by a landslide, making her the first Latina woman to be elected to the City Council. She was succeeded in the State Assembly by .\n\nWhile on the council, Molina feuded with Richard Alatorre, who had been elected to the council in 1985.\n\n\nIn 1990,  decided not to run for re-election for the 1st district of the , but served an extra three months while the board redistricted under court orders to create a majority-Latino district. That year, Molina announced that she would be running for the seat, being challenged by U.S. Representative  and Art Torres. The runoff election was between Molina and Torres, with Torres having a lead in fundraising for his campaign. Although Molina was at a disadvantage financially, she still defeated Torres to become the first Latina to be elected to the Board of Supervisors.\n\nAt her first meeting, she was described as \"[giving] hints of the in-your-face approach that sometimes characterized her years on the City Council.\" During her 23 years serving the Los Angeles County board of supervisors, she became known as a fiscal watchdog committed to overseeing good government reforms, maintenance of the county's public health care system, and also quality-of-life issues for the millions of county residents living in the unincorporated areas.\n\nOne of Molina's significant achievements was her involvement with the , a group formed to organize against a proposed plan to build a prison in . As city councilwoman, she found government unresponsive to her concerns of yet another proposal to build a prison near schools in the predominantly  and Mexican neighborhood.  In the mid-2000s she drove through skid row looking for families with children and would call the Department of Family and Children Services, to help families and remove children from unsafe conditions.\n\nIn 2008, Molina piloted a program that became known as the Gloria Molina Foster Youth Education Program. This program attempted to improve the high school graduation rates of students in the foster care system. By committing social workers to aid in helping manage and track these students' academic success the program was able to raise the graduation rate from the national average of 58% to 80%. When Molina retired from her supervisor position in 2014 because of term limits, she stated that one of her biggest regrets was that she was not able to do more to improve the high school graduation rates amongst fostered youth.\n\n\nIn 2014, facing a term limit on the Board of Supervisors, Molina announced that she was challenging  incumbent  for his seat on the City Council. She had stated that she had considered retirement before being asked to run from various people, and criticized Huizar for not heeding his constituents. In the 2015 election, Huizar defeated Molina and other competitors by a landslide, avoiding the need for a runoff.\n\n\n\nIn April 2008, Molina introduced legislation to the board of supervisors which would severely increase penalties on food vendors in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, including East L.A. The new rules would punish parking of a food truck for more than one hour with a $1000 fine and/or six months in jail.  This move was specifically targeted at vendors operating taco trucks, a cultural institution in East L.A. as well as the county as a whole.  Newspaper editorials decried the move, and a petition was quickly set up to attempt to force a repeal of the legislation. The taco vendors also hired a lawyer to fight their cause. The ordinance was ultimately struck down by a judge.\n\n\nIn June 2010, Molina voted yes with two other Los Angeles County supervisors to boycott  because of . Molina said in her statement that the law \"simply goes too far\" and that \"a lot of people have pointed out that I am sworn as an L.A. County supervisor to uphold the Constitution. All I can say is that I believe that Arizona's law is unconstitutional.\"\n\n\nMolina was married to Ron Martinez, a businessman, with the two having a daughter, Valentina Martinez. She lived in the Los Angeles neighborhood of .\n\nIn March 2023, Molina announced that she had been diagnosed with  cancer three years prior, and that she had been battling it with treatments but it had become very aggressive. She died on May 14, 2023, seventeen days before her 75th birthday.\n\n\nIn April 2006, Molina was honored as the \"Hispanic Business Woman of the Year\" by ''Hispanic Business'' magazine. In 2014, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from . Molina also , founding the East L.A. Stitchers and frequently knitting with the group until her announcement of terminal cancer.\n\nIn 2023, after Molina's announcement of terminal cancer, , Molina's successor on the Board of Supervisors, introduced a motion to rename  to Gloria Molina Grand Park, honoring her contributions to the park's redevelopment. It was approved unanimously by the Board of Supervisors the day it was introduced. A motion to endorse the renaming passing in the , with Mayor  also endorsing it. Another motion by councilmembers  and  renamed the pedestrian crosswalks \"Gloria Molina Legacy Pathway\".

A member of the , Villaraigosa was a national co-chairman of , a member of President 's Transition Economic Advisory Board, and chair of the .\n\nBefore becoming mayor, he was a member of the  (1994–2000), where he served as the Democratic Majority Leader (1996–98), and the  (1998–2000). As speaker, Villaraigosa was an advocate for working families and helped to write legislation protecting the environment, expanding healthcare access, and increasing funding for public schools.\n\nHe ran for mayor in  against  , but lost in the second round of voting. Villaraigosa ran for and was elected to the  in 2003. In 2005, he  again in a rematch against Hahn and won. During his tenure as mayor, he gained national attention for his work and was featured in ''''s story on the country's 25 most influential s. He was the first  in over 130 years to have served as mayor of Los Angeles. As mayor, Villaraigosa spearheaded policies to improve student outcomes in the Los Angeles Unified School District, reduce city and highway traffic, and enhance public safety.\n\nSince leaving office in 2013, Villaraigosa has continued to be actively engaged in education, civic engagement, water, immigration, transportation, and economic development issues. He speaks nationally and throughout California on these issues. In November 2016, Villaraigosa announced his candidacy for the  . In June 2018, Villaraigosa came in third in the blanket primary election, losing to  and .\n\nIn July 2024, Villaraigosa announced his candidacy for the .\n\n\nAntonio Ramón Villar Jr. grew up in the  neighborhood of 's , and attended both  and s. His father immigrated to the United States and became a successful businessman, but lost his wealth during the . His young wife left him at this time. His father abandoned their family when he was 5 years old, and aged 16, a benign tumor in his spinal column briefly paralyzed him from the waist down, curtailing his ability to play sports. His grades plummeted at , and the next year, he was expelled from the Roman Catholic institution after getting into a fight after a football game. He later was graduated from  in  after taking adult education classes there at night, and with the help of his English teacher, Herman Katz.\n\nVillar went on to attend  and eventually transferred to  (UCLA), graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1977. At UCLA, he was a leader of , an organization that seeks to promote  unity and empowerment through political action, but later renounced his association with the group citing its controversial stances on race. At this time, he went by the short form ''Tony'' of his given name Antonio. After UCLA, Villar attended the  (PCL). After completing law school and subsequently failing the  four times, he became a field representative/organizer with the  where he organized teachers and was regarded as a gifted advocate. He later served as president of the Los Angeles chapter of the  and the .\nHe adopted the  Villaraigosa upon his marriage with Corina Raigosa in 1987.\n\n\n\n in June 2000]]\nIn 1990, Villaraigosa was appointed to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Board, where he served until 1994. In 1994, he was elected to the . Within his first term, he was selected to serve as Democratic Assembly Whip and Assembly Majority Leader. In 1998, Villaraigosa was chosen by his colleagues to be the Speaker of the Assembly, the first from Los Angeles in 25 years. He left the Assembly in 2000 after serving three two-year terms.\n\n\n\n\n\nVillaraigosa ran for election as  in , but was defeated by   in a run-off election. In 2003, Villaraigosa defeated incumbent Councilman  to win a seat on the  representing the 14th District.\n\nVillaraigosa placed first in the primary for the  of March 8, 2005, and won the run-off election on May 17, receiving 58.7% of the vote. On July 1, 2005, Villaraigosa was sworn in as the 41st . He became the first Latino Mayor of Los Angeles since 1872, when  (who served from 1866 to 1868 and again from 1870 to 1872) held the office. Attendees to his first inauguration included then Governor ; former Governors , , and ; former Vice President , U.S. Secretary of State , and New York City Mayor .\n\nVillaraigosa was re-elected in 2009, receiving 55.65% of the vote against his most prominent challenger, attorney  who won 26.23% of the vote. Villaraigosa drew controversy by refusing to debate any of his opponents before the election.\n\n\n\n\n and Transportation Secretary  look on.]]\n\nOne of Villaraigosa's main transportation-related goals was to extend the  down  to . Proponents dubbed the project the \"Subway to the Sea.\" Villaraigosa persuaded Congressman  to repeal the ban on subway tunneling in Los Angeles, which occurred in 2006.\n\nOn November 4, 2008, Los Angeles County voters passed , an additional half-cent per dollar sales tax that increased the sales tax rate in Los Angeles County from 8.25% to 8.75% and is projected to generate up to $40 billion over 30 years for transportation. Measure R included funding for the portion of the \"Subway to the Sea\" between Wilshire/Western and Westwood/VA Hospital; a project known as the . Its passage was credited in large part to Villaraigosa, who lobbied the Metropolitan Transportation Agency and County Board of Supervisors to place it on the November ballot, and helped organize the fundraising efforts.\n\nWorking with , then Chair of the City Council's Transportation Committee, Villaraigosa issued an executive directive aimed at banning road construction during rush hour in traffic-plagued Los Angeles, and established anti-gridlock zones and launched Tiger Teams to improve traffic flow during peak rush hour times. Villaraigosa even publicly pledged to take the subway to work one day a month, as reported by the ''''. This, however, proved impossible for him.\n\nIn February 2010, Villaraigosa traveled to Washington, D.C. in order to promote a \"Ten/Thirty\" plan that requests an $8.8 billion  to augment the $5.8 billion expected from  tax revenues. Proceeds would accelerate the construction of 12 mass transit projects. The loan would be repaid with continuing income from  funds. Villaraigosa's 30/10 plan eventually morphed into the America Fast Forward program and was passed by Congress.\n\nOn Sunday July 18, 2010, Villaraigosa fell from his bicycle after being cut off by a taxi driver; Villaraigosa suffered a broken elbow in the fall, and the taxi driver fled the scene. The accident converted Villaraigosa into \"a new champion of cyclists' rights\", when he declared a  summit, and announced that he would push for the passage of a \"3 foot passing rule\" in California. The two-hour-long summit meeting, held Monday, August 16, 2010, was criticized for not including input from Los Angeles' Bicycle Advisory Committee, which has held a number of Bicycle Summit meetings. Villaraigosa has also supported implementation of Los Angeles' Bicycle Master Plan, adopted in March 2011, which set a long-term goal of creating a network of  of interconnected bikeways spanning the city. Subsequent to the adoption of the plan, Villaraigosa issued an executive directive that mandated the construction of 40 miles of bikeways each year and requires city agencies to include bicycle-friendly features in their programs and expand public education and training campaigns.\n\n\nAs mayor, Villaraigosa was a member of the , a national organization of Mayors whose goal is to increase gun control. While mayor, Villaraigosa pursued an agenda of making Los Angeles the safest big city in America.\n\nVillaraigosa proposed a Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness initiative, which would add certain units to the Los Angeles Police and Fire Departments and reorganize some of the current practices. Villaraigosa also created the Homeland Security Advisors, a group of approximately 40 leaders. The panel includes Police Chief , former L.A.  chief , former Mayor , Los Angeles County Sheriff  and former District Attorney . It will be co-chaired by his Deputy Mayor for  and Public Safety . The panel planned for such issues as counter-terrorism measures, evacuation planning and emergency preparedness.\n\nVillaraigosa vowed to hire 1,000 new police officers. On March 6, 2009, Mayor Villaraigosa and Police Chief Bratton announced that the L.A.P.D. had expanded to its largest force in city history. On May 14, 2009, City Council approved an LAPD/LAFD hiring freeze. In a television advertisement paid for by the Villaraigosa campaign, Chief Bratton stated that \"Crime is down to levels of the 1950s.\" 24 hours before the March 3 election, Villaraigosa and Bratton reannounced a statement from the Mayor's Office that the \"citywide crime-rate drop to the lowest level since 1956, the total number of homicides fall[ing] to a 38-year low. Gang homicides were down more than 24 percent in 2008.\" However, former Chief of Police  argued against this statistic, citing a trend toward lengthier prison sentences for career criminals as the reason for the change. In fact, crime fell by 43 percent across California between 1994 and 1999. The figures are also disputed by Patrick Range McDonald and Professor Andrew Karmen, John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Karmen stated that, adjusting for population, the Los Angeles murder rate would need to be 180 or less to be equivalent to the crime rate of 1956, with its rate of 104 homicides per 2.2 million people, or one killing for every 22,115 people (the 2007 rate was 396 per 4 million people, or one killing per 10,101 people). McDonald further noted that, \"In 1956, 89 percent of homicides were cleared. Today, if you kill another human being in Los Angeles, chances are very good you will get away with it: 43 out of every 100 killers are not caught.\" Similarly, he notes, \"In 1956, 42 percent of robberies were cleared by an arrest. Today, that number is 26 percent.\"\n\n\n\nVillaraigosa sought to gain control of the  (LAUSD) as one of his top priorities as mayor, but instead was able to create the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, a subset of LAUSD comprising the district's lowest-performing schools.\n\nIn his first State of the City address, he announced his intention to assume full control of the LAUSD, through a bill passed by the state legislature. The  and  immediately protested though there was support in the community from different areas in Los Angeles. He raised the issue of education as a critical part of solving economic disparity, providing the workforce for the future and articulated that \"education is the civil rights issue of our time.\" Because LAUSD includes many other municipalities outside the city of Los Angeles, Villaraigosa wanted to engage all of the elected officials in those cities. He brought together union leaders and state legislators to create a Council of Mayors of the 28 cities served by LAUSD. The votes of each mayor would be proportionate to the city's population.\n\nThe biggest issue during the Mayoral election of 2005 was public education. Because he campaigned and won on the issue of education, Villaraigosa sought the legal authority to do so through . AB 1381 was passed by the state legislature and signed by  . However, the plan received significant opposition among the Los Angeles Board of Education, Board President Marlene Canter and then-superintendent of LAUSD, , among others. On December 21, 2006, AB 1381 was ruled unconstitutional.\n\nIn response, Villaraigosa founded a non-profit entity called the Mayor's Partnership for Los Angeles Schools to take control of the district's lowest-performing schools and transform them into high-performing schools. The Partnership eventually managed 21 LAUSD campuses, which operate under the same labor contract as LAUSD. Though schools in the Partnership were among the lowest performing in the district, they eventually made the largest gains in the state based on California's Annual Performance Index measure, and are now considered among the best performing urban schools in the state. The Partnership has generated some controversy since its founding. In June 2009, teachers at eight of the ten campuses cast a vote of \"no confidence\" in the Partnership. Villaraigosa continues to serve the Partnership by raising money in support of its success. The Partnership includes a program for parents called the \"Partnership's Parent College.\" To date, over 10,000 of the Partnership's 16,000 parents have graduated from the Parent College.\n\nIn his final state of the City speech as Mayor of Los Angeles, Villaraigosa reiterated his commitment to education reform and expressed concern that the other Mayoral candidates did not share the same commitment to education in Los Angeles. \"Education can't be a footnote on a campaign mailer or fodder for an attack ad,\" Villaraigosa said in his speech at UCLA's Royce Hall. \"It's time for our candidates to demonstrate the 'fierce urgency of now' when it comes to ensuring that all of our children have access to great schools.\"\n\n\nIn January 2005, Villaraigosa appeared before a coalition of animal rights activists and pledged that, if elected, he would implement a no-kill policy for Animal Services and fire General Manager Guerdon Stuckey, an appointee of former Mayor Hahn. Animal activists had expressed doubts regarding Stuckey's ability to lead the Department of Animal Service since his appointment, primarily citing his lack of experience. During Stuckey's tenure, activist concern intensified due to a refusal to accept charity-sponsored spay and neuter services, firings of several key animal rights-oriented workers, and excessive euthanasia of animals held by Animal Services. Approximately one year after Villaraigosa's initial promise to fire Stuckey and substantial negative press, Villaraigosa fired Stuckey. Stuckey appealed the firing to the City Council and threatened a lawsuit, and in February 2006, the Los Angeles City Council awarded Stuckey a $50,000 consulting fee with the agreement that there would be no lawsuit. In January 2006, Villaraigosa appointed Ed Boks to the General Manager position. In April 2009, Boks resigned after complaints from some staff, city councillors, and animal advocates. In June 2010, fifteen months after Boks' resignation, Brenda Barnette, former CEO of the Seattle Humane Society was appointed.\n\n\nVillaraigosa tripled the city's trash collection fee from $11 per month to $36.32 per month for single-family homes, stating: \"Every new dollar residents pay for trash pickup will be used to put more officers on the streets,\" in a press release dated April 12, 2006. A 2008 L.A. City Controller audit by Laura Chick determined that 2008 \"only $47 million, or about one-third of the new trash-fee revenue then pouring into city coffers, went to hiring police, and only 366 officers were hired instead of the promised 1,000.\"\n\nVillaraigosa then lobbied to place Proposition S on the ballot to fund new police officers, concerned that a pending court ruling could eliminate the 40-year-old 10% telephone tax. This generated some controversy among tax activists, as Villaraigosa and his negotiating team had recently reached a salary agreement resulting in a 23% pay hike. Controller Laura Chick noted that Proposition S language does not restrict expenditure to police and firefighters, and instead deposits the money into the general fund. It is not certain that any of the Prop S monies were used to hire new police officers. Villaraigosa supports Proposition O, which currently adds $10.22 to the property tax bill of a $350,000 home and will eventually climb to $35.00. Villaraigosa also campaigned last fall for two education bond measures that will increase the size of property tax bills over the next decade.\n\nOn March 23, 2010, Villaraigosa, in a leaked memo warned the Los Angeles City Council that their potential failure to support a series of four proposed rate increases totaling 37% and already approved by the city's Department of Water and Power would be \"the most immediate and direct route to bankruptcy the city could pursue\".\n\n\nIn April 2008, Villaraigosa set aside a large parcel of industrial land around the  to create a \" corridor.\" The project never materialized.\n\nVillaraigosa played a critical role in establishing the  and voiced his support for the organization during the night of their opening.\n\n\nIn February 2006, Villaraigosa was presented with the  Legacy Foundation Achievement Award for \"following in the footsteps of the first African American Mayor of Los Angeles who served the city for 51 years.\" Citing the similarity of the two mayors in building coalitions among diverse communities, the speakers praised Villaraigosa for his vision for the City of Los Angeles. Also in attendance were Mrs. Ethel Bradley, daughter Lorraine and many of Mayor Bradley's former staff members.\n\nOn May 6, 2006, Villaraigosa was awarded an honorary degree by , and was the Class of 2006 Commencement Speaker. On May 12, 2006, he was awarded a  by the  and was the Class of 2006 commencement speaker. In June 2006, Villaraigosa received the Golden Plate Award of the . In 2007, he was awarded an honorary  from .\n\nVillaraigosa was one of ten mayors from North America to be short-listed as a finalist for the 2008  Award.\n\n\n\nIn October 2006, Villaraigosa traveled to England and Asia for a sixteen-day trade mission. In England, he visited London and , at the invitation of then-Prime Minister , and spoke about Los Angeles' efforts regarding global warming, homeland security and emergency preparedness, and its bid for the . Prime Minister Blair had visited Mayor Villaraigosa a couple months prior to that in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2006, Villaraigosa led a delegation of over 50 business leaders to China, , and Japan that secured $300 million in direct foreign investment. In Beijing, Villaraigosa opened a LA Inc. tourism office, in order to ensure a permanent welcome for the millions of Chinese tourists who will visit Los Angeles over the next decade. In Japan, Villaraigosa launched a See My LA advertising campaign in Tokyo-based Family Mart convenience stores throughout Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nIn February 2008, Villaraigosa welcomed Mexican President  and members of the Mexican delegation to discuss trade opportunities and witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Mexico Business Council for Foreign Trade, Investment and Technology (COMCE) and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nVillaraigosa traveled to Israel in June 2008 to meet with experts in homeland security, counter-terrorism, and green technology. He also signed an agreement with the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT – part the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya) on behalf of the LA police department. Under the agreement, the ICT will train US homeland security officials. In recent years, he developed a relationship with the Mayor of the Israeli city of , Eli Moyal, and met with him during the visit. Villaraigosa has long retained strong ties to the Los Angeles Jewish Community, having spent part of his childhood in the once-Jewish dominated neighborhood of Boyle Heights.\n\n\n 2011]]\nIn June 2009, Villaraigosa made the cover of , titled \"Failure,\" with an accompanying article written by Ed Leibowitz, which claimed that Villaraigosa often confused campaigning with governance, wasted 22 weeks in his first term trying to take over the school board, and did little to help education in the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2007, the '''' reported that Villaraigosa was under investigation for ethics violations: \"The executive director of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission...accused Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of 31 violations of campaign finance and disclosure laws stemming from his 2003 campaign for the City Council.\"\n\nIn June 2010, a formal ethics investigation of Villaraigosa was launched due to his unreported acceptance of 81 tickets to concerts, awards ceremonies and sporting events. Estimatesincluding the 13 Lakers courtside tickets valued at $3,100 each and Academy Awards and Governor's Ball tickets at $21,000 eachsuggest that the value of the tickets could amount to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\nAt the , where Villaraigosa was chairman, the original 2012 party platform caused controversy after it was written, because of the lack of typical invocations and references to God and God-given rights, as well as lack of language affirming the role of  as the capital of Israel. Both of these matters had been included in some previous platforms. On the second day, September 5, former Ohio Governor  introduced an amendment on the floor of the convention to re-insert language invoking God and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Convention Chairman Villaraigosa put the amendment to a voice vote requiring a two-thirds majority for passage. After the first vote had greater volume of \"nays\", Villaraigosa called for a second vote, which was again met with greater volume of \"nays\" than \"yays\". A woman standing to his left said, \"You've got to rule, and then you've got to let them do what they're gonna do.\" Villaraigosa called a third vote, with the same result. Despite not receiving a two-thirds majority, Villaraigosa still declared the amendment passed, causing an eruption of boos on the floor.\n\n\nIn February 2015, while Villaraigosa was considering a run for the , the '''' reported on Villaraigosa's work as an advisor to controversial   company . The story questioned whether Villaraigosa's relationship with Herbalife would become a significant hurdle in a statewide run, given the company's checkered reputation and ongoing  investigations. Herbalife has been strongly criticized as being a  that specifically targets Hispanics.\n\nVillaraigosa's role as a consultant to the embattled company was condemned by the , an advocacy organization focused on Hispanic advancement.\n\n\n\nAfter his election as Los Angeles Mayor, Villaraigosa was featured on the cover of '','' and in ''''s story on the country's 25 most influential Latinos, but repeated questions concerning his marital infidelity issues appear to have damaged his reputation locally and nationally. His approval rating when he left office was 47%.\n\nVillaraigosa has also received criticism because of his membership in  while attending UCLA and his alleged support for . He has also been criticized because of the high frequency in which he holds press conferences, attends photo-ops, and travels out of town (including campaigning for ). An '''' article by Patrick Range McDonald published on September 11, 2008, presented an analysis of a 10-week period from May 21 to August 1, and determined that \"On direct city businesssuch as signing legislation and meeting with city-department headshis schedule shows the mayor spent 11 percent of his time...Yet the 11 percent of Villaraigosa's time that the Weekly has identified as being spent in L.A. on actual city workrunning, fixing or shaping government policies and actionsreveals that he frequently spends that limited time huddling with special-interest groups who have helped him attain higher office.\"\n\nA November 4, 2008 election day poll, conducted by the  at  found that Villaraigosa had a job approval rating of 61%. In 2009, a poll by the Los Angeles times showed his approval rating had slipped to 55%, \"relatively low for a sitting Mayor who faced little name opposition in his recent re-election victory.\" At the same time, his showing and that of the candidates he supported in the election were lackluster.\n\nVillaraigosa was featured in the editorial cover story of the June 2009 '''' Magazine, which took him to task for a lack of effectiveness regarding many of his stated policy priorities, and a focus on election to higher office, to the detriment of the needs of the city. In response, the '''' devoted its June 11 cover story to a defense of Villaraigosa's record.\n\nAfter he left the mayor's office, Villaraigosa was involved in Campaign to Fix the Debt, a movement for entitlement reform to cut Social Security and Medicare, which Democratic strategist  said is \"not just touching the third rail&nbsp; it's an act of public self-immolation.\"\n\n\nVillaraigosa's first of four children, Marisela Villar, was born when he was 21. His second child, Prisila Villar, was born four years later.\n\nHe married Corina Raigosa on November 28, 1987, and adopted a combination of their last names as his family name. The couple had two children, Natalia and Antonio Jr. In the wake of his affair with  television reporter Mirthala Salinas, Villaraigosa announced that he was separating from his wife, and on June 12, 2007, Corina Villaraigosa filed for  in the  due to adultery. Villaraigosa acknowledged on July 3, 2007, that he was in a relationship with Salinas. As a result of the affair, Salinas was suspended by her employer, , and against her will was relocated to , after which she resigned. In a '''' profile published shortly before the divorce, Villaraigosa acknowledged that he and Corina had had difficulties over the course of their marriage. \"In a twenty-year marriage, there are many ups and downs\", Villaraigosa said.

The company also focused on gathering resources for childhood education, emancipated foster children, pregnant youth, and families impacted by gang violence.

There was criticism of the action considering Goh served on the board, the action seeming to be influenced by Goh's presence. However, the Chamber clarified that it was an independent entity from the board and is not influenced by outside forces. As the PAC is funded by members and the Chamber is a membership organization, the Chamber PAC claimed this served to validate the endorsement of Goh for mayor.\n\nOn November 8, 2016, at age 60, Goh won the runoff election and became the 26th mayor of .

Goh has also stated her appreciation for all healthcare workers as COVID cases rise throughout the country.\n\nOn September 18, 2020, Goh had released a video to Bakersfield residents to rally together to attempt reopening. Goh had advised residents to put politics aside and instead called on the community to reach state metrics needed to begin to reopen schools, gyms, and other businesses. To do this, residents would need to continue to respect social distancing guidelines and mask mandates.\n\nOn February 2, 2021, Goh signed a letter which encouraged the state of California to approve COVID-19 vaccinations for TK through second grade students and educators.\n\n\n\nThe city of Bakersfield and Goh also work towards preventing homelessness with their housing policies and programs. They have implemented an Affordable Housing program which provides funds for developing housing for low income families, as well as the HOME-ARP (American Rescue Plan) program which also provided funding to give those who experience homelessness, or the vulnerable, a home or shelter. This act of 2021 had gathered up to $5 billion to provide these services.\n\n\n\nThe city of Bakersfield has done many things to make transportation easier as well as promote more active ways of transport.

It was while working at MacMillian-McGraw Hill that Goh witnessed the attacks from her office window. As an executive, Goh recalled feeling responsible for the safety of her colleagues, the fear and uncertainty of the next steps to take left Goh in confusion.

In July 2020, she launched the Emergency Renters Assistance Program, which provided $103 million in subsidies of up to $2,000 per household for renters who could demonstrate how they were impacted by COVID-19 and who earned less than 80% of the area median income.\n\nShe also allocated $50 million to provide two weeks pay to those who were infected and could not work, $40 million for a regional COVID-19 Relief and Recovery Fund to provide grants to small businesses, which included specific allocations for micro-entrepreneurs like street vendors and for victims of domestic violence, and $30 million to assist low-income families access child care, which included $10 million to establish 50 Alternative Learning Centers at city parks, and $20 million to help child care facilities stay open and offer vouchers to families. In October 2020, she announced a $50 million program to provide one-time grants of $500 to help Angelenos who lost work because of the pandemic pay their utility bills over the holidays.\n\n\nAlong with Councilmembers  and , Martinez passed a law in 2014 boosting the minimum wage to $15.37 for employees at large hotels in Los Angeles. The following year, Martinez was one of six Councilmembers that led the successful push to raise the minimum wage from $9 to $15 for all workers in Los Angeles, to be gradually phased in over five years.\n\n\nMartinez had focused on domestic violence and  in her district and throughout the city. In 2014, Martinez passed an ordinance that temporarily prohibited strip clubs, massage parlors and other types of adult businesses from getting city permits along four streets in her district to crack down on prostitution.\n\nIn 2015, the Councilwoman led the creation of the Valley Bureau Human Trafficking Task Force, which targets the criminal enterprise behind prostitution and the \"johns\" that support this activity, as well as provides services to those who are sexually exploited. Within three years, the model had been expanded to a second task force in South Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2017, Martinez designated the first city-sponsored shelters for victims of human trafficking to be included in an expansion of the city's shelters for domestic violence victims. In 2019, Martinez supported a successful law authored by California State Senator , which clarified that local governments could adopt local ordinances to prevent slavery or human trafficking and allow for certain businesses and entities to post notices about resources available to victims of slavery and human trafficking.\n\n\nIn 2020, Councilwoman Martinez opened a temporary trailer shelter in  as part of Mayor 's \"A Bridge Home\" shelter program that provides shelter and services to homeless individuals before being placed in permanent housing. She also launched a program called Kids First to provide tutoring and other support services to homeless students living in three motels in her district, with particular support to address the challenges of distance learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nCouncilwoman Martinez had also been an advocate for the undocumented community in the San Fernando Valley. In January 2020, she placed a ban on migrant centers within Los Angeles city limits after a children's migrant center was proposed in the community of Arleta in her district.\n\n\nWhile President Trump was in office, Martinez called on the City of Los Angeles to sue the Trump Administration over its decision to implement a \"public charge\" rule, which would restrict public benefits such as medical care and housing for undocumented immigrants, as well as challenge the Trump Administration's policies related to detaining immigrant children and separating them from their families at U.S. borders.\n\n\nAs the former Executive Director of Pacoima Beautiful, Martinez began working on a policy that she ultimately helped pass on the City Council in 2016 called the Clean Up, Green Up Initiative, which designated \"green zones\" in Pacoima, Sun Valley, Wilmington and Boyle Heights, some of Los Angeles's most polluted communities. The initiative consisted of special land-use restrictions, the creation of a citywide office to support environmental compliance, and citywide protections for new developments near freeways.\n\nIn early 2019, she joined several of her colleagues to introduce a local Green New Deal for the City of Los Angeles.\n\nIn August 2020, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power revealed that there had been methane gas leaks at the Valley Generating Station in Martinez's district for over a year. Martinez subsequently called for the plant to be shut down, which was formalized by a vote of the City Council in November 2020 directing the department to develop a timeline for the plant's closure.\n\nThe Councilwoman employed two dedicated staffers to pick up trash and deal with illegal dumping in her district to supplement service provided by the city's Sanitation Department.\n\n\nIn 2015, Martinez's reelection campaign was accused of submitting fraudulent donor information in order to receive $65,360 in taxpayer-matched funds. In 2019, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office ended its investigation into Martinez's 2015 campaign, citing insufficient evidence to pursue a fraud case.\n\n\n\nOn October 9, 2022, an audio recording of a conversation involving Martinez, fellow council members  and  and  President  regarding redistricting was leaked anonymously onto . In the meeting, Martinez stated, \"Fuck that guy … He's with the blacks\", referring to District Attorney . \n\nMartinez also insulted fellow  's black adopted child, saying \"They're raising him like a little white kid ... I was like, 'This kid needs a beatdown. Let me take him around the corner, I'll bring him right back.' \" Martinez also called the child a \"\" according to the '''', a racial slur for a black person meaning \"little monkey\" or \"little ape\" in .\n\nIn the course of the discussion on redistricting, she commented, \"I see a lot of little short dark people there\" in reference to . \"Oaxacan Koreans. Not even like Kevin. Little ones,\" Cedillo replied. She then continued, \"I was like, I don't know what village they came from, how they got here, but whatever.\" She can also be heard to remark, \"tan feos\" or \"they're so ugly\" in Spanish.\n\t\nThe three council members discussed how to appoint a new council member who would work in their interests, and also agreed to  's district in order to suppress those who had voted for her. , a former California State Director for then-Senator  was suggested. On August 26, 2022, Martinez introduced a motion to appoint Hutt as a council member, which was seconded by four other members. The motion was opposed by  and , who instead proposed instructing the City Attorney to find eligibility requirements for appointments. On August 30, the vote to instate Hutt as a councilmember fell one vote short, with five voting for and five voting against; it was referred to the Rules, Elections and Intergovernmental Relations Committee for further discussion. The Committee cleared her for reconsideration by the Council the next day, and Hutt was confirmed by the Council in the next meeting and sworn in on September 2, 2022.\n\nIn addition, in the same leaked audio clips posted to Reddit in which former Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez made racist remarks about black people and Oaxacans, she also made crude remarks about Jewish people and Armenians. Martinez can be heard saying the “judíos”  which means Jews in Spanish  “cut their deal with South L.A.”  Martinez was responding to former Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera, who had concluded, “I’m sure Katz and his crew have an agenda,” referring to former state Assemblymember Richard Katz.  “They are gonna screw everybody else,” Martinez said in the recording.\n\nMartinez later provided a statement in the '''' apologizing, \"In a moment of intense frustration and anger, I let the situation get the best of me. I hold myself accountable for these comments. For that I am sorry.\" Bonin's family replied in a tweet condemning the racist comments and demanding Martinez's resignation.\n\nOn October 10, Martinez stepped down as president through a released statement that apologized to Bonin and others, saying, \"Therefore, effective immediately I am resigning as President of the Los Angeles City Council,\" though she did not also resign from her seat on the city council.\n\nOne day later, Martinez announced she would be taking a leave of absence. In a statement, she said, \"At this moment, I need to take a leave of absence and take some time to have an honest and heartfelt conversation with my family, my constituents, and community leaders. I am so sorry to the residents of Council District 6, my colleagues, and the City of Los Angeles.\" Martinez could only have been forced to leave office via a voter-led , as rules for removal by other city council members would not apply in this situation. On October 11, 2022, numerous calls for the three councilpersons to step down, which included that of President , as well as a contentious City Council meeting with a heated public comment session combined to put additional pressure on Martinez. She resigned her Council seat the following day.\n\n\nMartinez is married to Gerry Guzman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the 1999 election, Harris, an African-American, sent targeted mailers to households in selected precincts, mostly , urging voters to vote for him and receive a  meal if they presented a voting stub at selected supermarkets.

A , she represented District 2, encompassing the  and  neighborhoods. She previously served as a member of the . She was appointed to the Board of Supervisors by  after he was elected mayor, in 2003. Newsom himself was initially appointed to this seat by former mayor .\n\nAlioto-Pier's paternal grandfather was former San Francisco mayor  and her maternal grandfather was Michael J. Driscoll Sr., a former San Francisco port commissioner and former San Francisco supervisor. She is the niece of , former president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She is the most recent member of the Alioto family to hold an elected political office in San Francisco.\n\n\nIn 1981, at age thirteen, Alioto-Pier was paralyzed from the waist down when she fell from a ski lift in the Lake Tahoe area.  At age seventeen, she was appointed by  to the advisory board of the President's . Alioto-Pier later received a degree in anthropology from . \n\n\nAfter working as an aide to Vice President , Alioto-Pier made her first run for public office at 28 in 1996 against Republican Congressman  in , which included , , and  counties, stretching along the coast up to the  border.  She won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election. She is credited with mounting a strong campaign despite the loss. At the time, she ran under the name Michela Alioto.\n\nShortly after losing that election, Alioto-Pier announced that she would try again in 1998 but withdrew from the race in deference to fellow Democrat (and eventual winner) . Instead, she ran for the office of  and won the Democratic nomination but ultimately lost against Republican incumbent . She again ran for Secretary of State in 2002, but lost the Democratic nomination to fellow San Franciscan , whose father preceded Alioto-Pier's grandfather as that city's mayor.\n\n\nIn January 2004, Alioto-Pier was appointed by Mayor  to his old seat in District 2 on the . Although even-numbered districts were not slated for election until 2006, an off-year election was held for District 2 because she was an appointed supervisor. Alioto-Pier ran for the seat in the November 2004 election and won, and in 2006 she ran for a full term and won easily.\n\nAs a supervisor, Alioto-Pier was committed to the preservation of St. Brigid's Church, which was once slated for demolition. Another top priority for Alioto-Pier was earthquake preparedness, especially important for her district which was hit hard by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Alioto-Pier explained: \"As the district representative for a community that was really hit in Loma Prieta, it is my responsibility to make sure if something like that happens again that we know what we're doing.\"\n\nIn May 2004, she introduced a payroll tax exemption for biotech companies in efforts to create a biotech cluster in San Francisco which was later passed by the full Board of Supervisors.  San Francisco had over 250 biomedical companies.\n\nAs a San Francisco moderate, Alioto-Pier was attacked by San Francisco progressives for having a poor attendance record and mediocre constituent relations. One significant source of the criticism was over Alioto-Pier's attendance record while she was giving birth to her third child, which was a first for an elected official in San Francisco. Alioto-Pier responded by passing a family leave policy for elected officials in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2007 it was announced that St. Luke's, a hospital serving under-privileged communities, would be closed to acute and sub-acute patients and serve as an outpatient facility only. In January 2008, it was announced that Alioto-Pier would lead a panel of stakeholders to save St. Luke's. \"Maintaining and rebuilding St. Luke's and developing it into a first-class hospital for the Mission District and the Southeast section of San Francisco is my primary objective.\" In response to the recommendations of the panel, in September 2008  (owner of St. Luke's) announced a reversal of their decision, stating that St. Luke's would be re-built to continue serving the communities that depend upon it.\n\nOn July 20, 2009, San Francisco Chronicle political columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross broke the story of Alioto-Pier's announcement for .\n\n}}\n\nAlioto-Pier subsequently left the race for insurance commissioner due to a leg injury.\n\n\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Alioto-Pier submitted papers to register as a candidate for re-election to District Two of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. San Francisco Department of Elections Director John Arntz issued a letter that same day in which he announced she was ineligible to run for re-election for District Two supervisor due to a 2008 ruling regarding term limits issued by City Attorney . Arntz wrote, \"Accordingly, the Department of Elections cannot list you as a candidate for this office on the November 2, 2010 ballot or any other election materials for that election.\" She would have served on the Board of Supervisors for seven years when her term expired in January 2011. Supervisors are limited to serving two four-year terms.\n\nThe municipal ordinance providing for term limits was a matter of debate. Some claimed that the ordinance states that any person who has served more than one-and-a-half four-year terms in office (six years) shall be deemed to have effectively served for two full terms and thus be ineligible to seek re-election. Others claimed that the law is more nuanced and that one must be appointed to serve more than two years for it to count as a full term. Alioto-Pier was appointed to serve one year, ran for a two-year term, and then ran again for a four-year term. According to this view, the question is whether or not the year she served as an appointed supervisor and the truncated two years she served can be combined and rounded up to count as a four-year term.\n\nAlioto-Pier challenged the ruling from the Department of Elections in  and won. In response, Herrera appealed that decision and overturned Alioto-Pier's victory, forcing her out of the 2010 election for District 2 Supervisor.\n\n\nOn February 7, 2011, Alioto-Pier filed as a candidate for mayor of San Francisco. In the November , she placed ninth in a field of 16 candidates.\n\n\nOn March 10, 2022, Alioto-Pier filed as a candidate for the California State Board of Equalization, District 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When Christensen used the physics concept of a a connection between two different space-timesto describe the  connecting Union Square and Chinatown, Peskin's ally  allegedly distorted the word ''wormhole'' to imply that Chinatown is a hole of worms, which successfully triggered the anger of some Chinatown residents. That negative press attributed to Pak's comments in Chinatown created an opportunity for Peskin to pick up much-needed votes in the Chinese community when he ran against Christensen. Peskin ultimately defeated Christensen. In 2019, Peskin proposed naming the Chinatown station of the  the Rose Pak Subway Station against strong opposition from practitioners of the  spiritual movement.\n\nPeskin opposed the 2022 , and co-sponsored a charter amendment that would have limited the eligibility window for recalls.\n\nPeskin will again be termed-out in 2024. He will not be eligible to run again until 2028. On April 4, 2024, he announced his candidacy for mayor in the  against incumbent London Breed.\n\n\n\nSince his first days in office, Peskin has been known as a \"neighborhood preservationist\" (''''), opposing and preventing many development projects in San Francisco, often citing their low affordable housing quotas and negative impact on locals. He has been described as aligned with \"the housing policies of San Francisco’s progressive Democrats, who prioritize existing tenants and neighborhood character when deciding where to build\" (KQED), but \"earn[ed] a reputation as the city’s preeminent  among housing activists\" (). \n\nPeskin has defended the  against widespread criticism that it had (as summarized by the ''San Francisco Chronicle'') \"become a cudgel used by NIMBYs to block any project they don't like\", with San Francisco's CEQA appeals process being especially onerous. Peskin described it as a \"remarkably helpful law\" that had protected the city from several bad projects, while acknowledging that the process was \"messy and time-consuming.\" Peskin blocked discussion of a 2021 proposal that would have required 50 signatures to invoke the California Environmental Quality Act to block projects, rather than just one person. \n\nIn 2023, Peskin authored legislation with Mayor Breed which aimed to redevelop underutilized space . The law promoted mixed-use zoning, housing development, and the conversion of commercial spaces to residential spaces. Later, in 2024, Peskin spearheaded an effort to designate the Northern Waterfront and  as historic districts and thus restoring the pre-2023 neighborhood height limit laws and preventing development of dense, large housing in the area. Peskin's legislation ultimately passed despite being vetoed by mayor  who said Peskin's bill \"passes off anti-housing policy under the guise of historic protection.\" \n\nPeskin instigated the  seizure of a triangular plot of private property at 701  in 2003. He acted with Telegraph Hill Dwellers, a neighborhood association, when it became clear that the lot could be used for open space and turned into a park. The parties attempting to commercially develop the lot called this an abuse of government power. The lot was approved as the new site for the North Beach branch of the  in 2011. The library was completed in 2014.\n\nPeskin prevented the conversion of hotel rooms by several San Francisco hotels into condominiums in 2005. He said that \"turning 226 hotel rooms into 60 luxury, multimillion-dollar condominium units isn't addressing the housing needs of San Francisco\". The legislation was ultimately passed with support from housing advocates and hotel workers.\n\nPeskin sponsored 2006 legislation to curb the , a state law that allows property owners to evict tenants by quitting the rental business, by prohibiting landlords who instigate an Ellis Act eviction from participating in the city's condominium conversion lottery. The Ellis Act has led to many  conversions of apartment buildings in San Francisco by tenants who desire to own property, and real estate promoters seeking to make ownership opportunities available (and thereby earning fees and profits).\n\nPeskin has been endorsed by the San Francisco Tenants Union, the Affordable Housing Alliance and the Community Tenants Association. In his 2015 reelection campaign, he advocated extending San Francisco's  to buildings constructed after 1979 (which would necessitate changes in state law). He has also been endorsed by the San Francisco Apartment Association, an advocacy group for rental building owners and property managers, of which he is a member as a landlord himself.\n\nPeskin opposes the  project, which over two decades is planned to create 7,000 to 8,000 housing units, 25 percent of which are affordable, alongside commercial, retail, office and public spaces. He led a group called Citizens for a Sustainable Treasure Island in lawsuits against the city of San Francisco and a developer, arguing that its impact on environment and traffic had not been properly reviewed. The courts rejected the complaint by Peskin and his group, with the  declining an appeal in October 2014.\n\nIn October 2021, Peskin voted to block construction of a 495-unit apartment building with 25% affordable housing on the site of a Nordstroms valet parking lot. That same month, Peskin voted against the construction of 316 micro-homes in Tenderloin, 13.5% of which would have been designated as affordable housing. Peskin said there was \"a glut of group housing in the Tenderloin and Mid-Market areas.\"\n\nIn January 2022, Peskin defended the delay in approval for a $18.7 million grant to repurpose a hotel in his district into a homeless shelter for upwards of 250 people. Peskin said that the project needed \"meaningful and real involvement with the community.\"\n\nIn 2023, Peskin voted to halt the conversion of a single-family home in Nob Hill into ten townhomes. He said that the new housing might adversely affect a nearby recreation center.\n\nIn 2024, Peskin opposed SB951, a bill that would remove the ability of the California Coastal Commission to delay and reject housing developments in areas of San Francisco's coast that are already urbanized. He also voted to block the construction of 24 housing units on the lot of a former medical library.\n\nPeskin has criticized the  of neighborhoods like the  and  which has displaced Black residents.\n\n\nPeskin spearheaded a 2001 plan to prevent the San Francisco Airport from filling in a  section of the San Francisco Bay to build more runways. His proposed cuts to the airport project were passed unanimously by the Board of Supervisors, which cut funding of field studies for environmental impacts of proposed runways nearly in half, from $11.2 million to $6.2 million.\n\nPeskin created the Landmarks Preservation Board, a commission to oversee the protection and preservation of historic sites in San Francisco, in 2008.\n \nWhile not in office, Peskin partnered with the  and the Audubon Society to file the Waterfront Watch Suit, which called for a process for review of Pier 29 rehabilitation work, a reduction of air emissions at Pier 27, and an agreement not to place a  on the water in Aquatic Park Lagoon.\n\n\nPeskin authored a 2007 charter amendment to increase  (Muni) funding and implement agency reforms.\n\nDuring his time as Supervisor of District 3 (2001–2009), Peskin supported the New Jefferson Street Project. The project was a plan to create the first pedestrian priority street to accommodate the high volume of tourist traffic into .\n\nPeskin and supervisor  opted to not introduce a $108 million sales tax measure onto the November 2020 ballot to finance , which had seen a 95% reduction in ridership due to the . Ride fares account for 70% of the service's operating budget. The supervisors cited the lack of shared authority on the Joint Powers Board over the train line's management, which is currently operated by , and the  of the sales tax to fund operations for a service whose customer base has a mean income of $120,000. Peskin noted that the measure could still be introduced by the mayor or other supervisors if they choose. The supervisors later changed their minds when Caltrain pledged to make changes to its structure, making it more independent from SamTrans.\n\n\nPeskin has been involved with contentious decisions which weighed public landmarks and events against the desires of his constituents, including the disagreement surrounding alcohol permits at the North Beach Jazz Festival, the temporary shutdown of the Savoy Tivoli, and cancelling the  because the bike race's backers owed the city money.\n\nIn 2007, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reporters Matier and Ross described Peskin as having a reputation as the \"Napoleon of North Beach.\" During Peskin's time as an influential neighborhood activist, he was known as \"The Ayatollah of North Beach\".Issacs, Matt (August 30, 2000)  . ''SF Weekly.'' (Retrieved May 21, 2013).\n\n\nPeskin has been known to make late night phone calls to public officials and private citizens. For example, he called the  director Monique Moyer several times about cutting their funding over disagreements concerning waterfront building height limits. Mayor Newsom told the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' that people around city hall had been complaining about Peskin's behavior for years. However, former San Francisco Mayor  has said Peskin's alleged behavior falls \"well within the boundaries of the system\" and that it's \"not unusual in politics at any level of government.\"\n\nIn 2018, at the scene of the St. Patrick's Day fire in North Beach, Peskin was reportedly intoxicated while he verbally berated then-Deputy Fire Chief of Operations Mark Gonzalez. Peskin has denied being intoxicated at the time but has apologized for his behavior.\n\nIn June 2021, Peskin announced in a statement that he would be entering into alcohol treatment. Peskin apologized for behavior that he attributed to his alcohol problem, but also announced that he planned to remain in office while in treatment.\n\n\nHe married in 1996 to land-use attorney Nancy Shanahan. As of 2024 (and since at least 2007, when it was headquartered in North Beach), Peskin and his wife run the non-profit Great Basin Land and Water, which is concerned with water rights and land transactions in the states of California, Nevada and Utah.\n\nHe is a member of the  and an avid outdoorsman, having hiked the  in 2006 and 2007.\n\n\nPeskin owns a  duplex in Telegraph Hill that he purchased for $800,000 in 2002 and had a market value of $1,750,000 in 2022. He and his wife own three additional houses in Telegraph Hill, which they rent out. The combined market value of his real estate properties was nearly $7,000,000 in 2022. According to Peskin's Statement of Economic Interests, these properties and his personal investments make him the wealthiest supervisor in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At nineteen, Guarriello became a lifeguard securing and overseeing the Island Park Beach, also known as Casino Beach.\n\nAt age twenty he was recruited by a larger establishment known as Sperry Gyroscope (), a company which manufactured gauges and instruments for U.S. fighter planes. While working for Sperry Gyroscope, he met Rita Gionta, an inspector who represented the Navy's division. Gionta was the inspector who overlooked Guarriello's quality control department. Guarriello and Rita were married on November 21, 1943.\n\nHis career in the manufacturing industry was short-lived because in January 1944, two months before his twenty-fifth birthday, Guarriello  was drafted into the US Military service in the .\n\n\n\nUpon being drafted into the service, Guarriello was transported to  to receive training as a . After six months of training, he was deployed to , , where the heaviest beach combats took place. Due to the high bloodshed, and the lack of medical personnel, Guarriello was appointed as a . Ironically, he was given this responsibility because of his experience as a lifeguard during his adolescence.\n\nOn April 19, 1945, Guarriello was wounded during an effort to save another comrade's life. During a heavy  and machine gun battle, a soldier from Guarriello's company lost his leg from a mortar explosion. As the company was retreating from the battlefield, Guarriello went back into the field to rescue the soldier. While he was showing medical attention to the wounded soldier, a mortar exploded behind Guarriello piercing him with  in his left arm and upper back. On April 26, 1945, while recovering in a hospital in , the  awarded Guarriello a  for being wounded in the line of duty.\n\n\nAfter coming home from the war, Guarriello purchased a house in ,  and founded a  Insurance Agency franchise. He later decided to expand his business ventures by moving out to the West Coast in 1964. , , was of particular interest to Guarriello because of the large residential and automobile market. Guarriello established his  Company agency franchise there and it continued to be a successful operation until he retired in December 1986, at the age of sixty-seven.\n\n\n\nAs a resident of  and longtime fixture on the  with his friend, the legendary , Guarriello joined the Coalition for Economic Survival (CES), the leading renters' rights organization in 1983. He joined CES's Steering Committee in 1986. In 1986, Guarriello became a member of the Board of Directors of the West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation (WHCHC), a non-profit corporation which rehabilitates run-down housing and builds new apartment buildings to increase the supply of affordable housing in West Hollywood. He was soon selected by his fellow Board members to serve as  of the organization. Guarriello was also featured in an  biography of the Sunset Strip.\n\nThe work of the WHCHC has been so successful that West Hollywood is replacing apartments lost to demolition with more than three times as many new affordable apartments. By January 1999, 141 low- and moderate-income housing units had been built in .\n\nIn 1988, Guarriello was appointed to the Rent Stabilization Commission. As a Commissioner, he helped develop policy on rent control matters and sat as judge on appeals of decisions made by Rent Stabilization Hearing Examiners.

Guarriello also served on the City's Banking and Reinvestment Task Force in 1988, where he worked with local banks to improve low-cost services to seniors and small businesses.\n\nIn April 1990, with seven years of experience serving the West Hollywood community, Guarriello was elected as a member of the West Hollywood City Council. He was reelected to the West Hollywood City Council four times: in April 1994, March 1999, March 2003, and March 2007. Guarriello, a gruff but lovable character, was famous for his bust of President  on his modest desk and used the slogan \"Give 'em Hell, Sal...\" in each of his re-election campaigns. While he faced tough opposition in each of his election campaigns, Sal's strong support from seniors, Russians and the LGBT community gave him a strong electoral base and ultimate success.\n\nGuarriello formed the Eastside Redevelopment Agency in 1997. The agency's first major project was the West Hollywood Gateway Project at Santa Monica Boulevard and La Brea Avenue. In 1998, he helped negotiate the transfer of ownership of  from the State of ,  to the City of West Hollywood. This transfer of ownership allowed the City to plan for a major rehabilitation of the Boulevard in 1999.\n\nGuarriello was awarded the \"Outstanding Community Service Award\" from the  Commission on Aging in May 2006. Sal was a tireless fighter for the issues that mattered most to him: affordable housing and the rights of Senior Citizens. To assist with his efforts, Guarriello recruited a local public safety activist, Donna Saur, to serve as his office deputy in 1999. Saur began working with Guarriello on many issues that required more immediate legislative attention, and she faithfully remained with him until his death. In 2002, Guarriello, with the assistance of his veteran political consultants Steven Afriat and Neal Zaslavsky, began the recall process against Los Angeles   after a  resident of , , was nearly beaten to death with a baseball bat by three men, because Cooley considered this crime a robbery rather than a .  Although he himself was straight, Sal was a fierce advocate for the city's large Gay & Lesbian population, and a majority of his appointments to city boards and commissions were gay men and lesbians.\n\nSince Guarriello served as an army combat medic in , in 1998 he initiated the West Hollywood  Memorial Task Force to create a permanent Veterans Memorial in West Hollywood. In the spring of 2001 the City of West Hollywood approved a Veterans Memorial intended to honor all  who have served the United States since the 1776 Revolution. The West Hollywood Veteran's Memorial in Holloway Park was dedicated on November 11, 2003.  On September 25, 2009, the city council unanimously voted to rename the park as the Sal Guarriello Veterans Memorial Park.\n\nUntil the time of his death, Sal continued to serve on many civic boards and enjoy a good Scotch. Guarriello represented West Hollywood as a director and chairman of the County Sanitation District No. 4 representing , , and . He also served as the City's delegate for the Southern California Cities Joint Powers Consortium. He was a delegate to the Joint Powers Insurance Authority, and served as a commissioner on the County Public Library Commission.\n\n90-year-old Councilmember Guarriello died on the morning of Thursday, April 16, 2009, at , surrounded by his friends, family and political supporters. At the time of his death, Sal was the oldest serving city councilmember in California. On May 6, the City Council appointed former  Hollywood Chapter President  to complete Guarriello's unexpired term. His seat was later filled by John D'Amico, who was elected in March 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Filner defeated Deddeh by a narrow margin, with Bates finishing third place in the primary. The district was almost 40%  (redistricting in 2000 made it 53% Hispanic) and heavily Democratic, and his victory in November (with 57 percent of the vote) was a foregone conclusion. He was reelected nine times with no substantive  opposition. He ran unopposed in 1998. He chose not to run for re-election to Congress in 2012, opting instead to run for mayor of San Diego.

In the primary on June 5, 2012, he placed second with 30.7% of the vote. He faced city councilmember  in the November 2012 runoff election. Filner defeated DeMaio, 52.5% to 47.5%. Filner, age 70, won as San Diego's first elected Democratic mayor since 1992 and only its second since 1971.\n\n\nIn his first speech as mayor, Filner promised to focus on rebuilding the neighborhoods of San Diego, improving city services, increasing staffing for public safety, bringing jobs to the city, and developing stronger regional ties with .\n\nIn January 2013, following a meeting between Filner and the San Diego chapter of , Filner instructed the  and city code compliance officers to stop enforcing  against  and stop forwarding cases to the San Diego City Attorney's Office. In April 2013, Filner proposed a new ordinance to restore permanent legal status to dispensaries, but the City Council rejected it and suggested that the City Attorney draft a new ordinance in its place. Meanwhile, federal agencies continued to raid and prosecute dispensaries within city limits.\n\nIn February 2013, Filner raised controversy by not authorizing funding of the Tourism Marketing District, a hotelier-run organization charged with promoting San Diego as a tourist destination that is funded by a 2 percent surcharge on hotel rooms. In 2012, the San Diego City Council agreed to renew the District for 39 1/2 years, but outgoing mayor Jerry Sanders did not sign the agreement before leaving office. Filner publicly withheld his signature on the agreement, wanting a series of concessions that would raise hotel worker salaries, protect the City from liability, and direct more of the funds collected to be used by the City of San Diego. The District subsequently filed suit against the Mayor to enforce the agreement, but Judge Timothy Taylor ruled that Filner had the discretion not to sign. After this ruling, Filner and the hoteliers agreed to a compromise and Filner signed the contract. However, in late May 2013 Filner temporarily withheld payments to the District until it agreed to provide upfront funding for a centennial celebration for .\n\n\n\nOn July 11, 2013, three of Filner's long-time supporters held a press conference to call for Filner's resignation as mayor, based on numerous unspecified but \"credible\" allegations that he had sexually harassed women.  said that it had been investigating reports of  of female staff members for several months, and that the complaints included \"inappropriate comments, kissing and groping\". Later that day Filner issued a video statement apologizing and saying that he was seeking professional help to change his behavior. The next day Filner told reporters that he had treated women poorly and sometimes intimidated them, but insisted that a \"fair and independent investigation\" would clear him of sexual harassment charges.\n\nOn July 12, Filner's chief of staff, Vince Hall, announced his resignation, effective immediately. On July 24, Filner's new chief of staff Tony Buckles, his former congressional chief of staff, resigned after only 10 days on the job and was replaced by Lee Burdick, a woman who had been serving as deputy chief of staff.\n\nOn July 15, the same three former supporters held another press conference, describing in more detail charges by women who said they had been forcibly kissed, groped, and subjected to sexually suggestive comments by Filner; the alleged but unidentified victims include a mayoral staffer, a campaign volunteer and a constituent. Filner repeated that he had done nothing wrong and would not resign.\n\nOn July 22, 2013, attorney  announced at a press conference that her firm had filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Filner on behalf of the mayor's former communications director. By August 26, 19 women had publicly claimed that Filner had sexually harassed them, including a retired admiral, a  impersonator who appeared at one of his fundraisers, a 67-year-old great-grandmother who worked for the city, a nurse who said Filner demanded a date in exchange for helping a Marine who had suffered a brain injury and  during service in Iraq, and several female members of the U.S. armed forces who had been raped during their service. In the last two instances, Filner's contact with the women stemmed from his position at the time as ranking member of the House .\n\nIn the ensuing weeks, calls for Filner's resignation came from Democratic U.S. senators  and , representatives  and ,  chairwoman and U.S Representative ,  members  and , , and all nine members of the City Council.\n\nOn July 26, 2013, Filner announced that he planned to take a leave of absence \"to undergo two weeks of intensive therapy” starting August 5. He started the treatment but ended it early on August 10, according to his attorney.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, Filner asked the city of San Diego to pay his legal fees for a sexual harassment lawsuit regarding his former communications director. The city council voted not to do so, and in fact to sue Filner for any costs incurred by the city due to claims filed against him and the city. The City Council later reversed itself as part of a negotiated agreement with Filner.\n\n\nFederal, state and local investigators looked into several other issues involving Filner. One matter involved a trip he took to Paris with his then-fiancée in June 2013; questions had been raised about the nonprofit group that paid his expenses and the use of city credit cards to pay for his accompanying security detail. On another issue,  agents looked into a pair of proposed housing developments which Filner blocked with an \"administrative hold\" until the developers contributed money to certain city projects.\n\n\nIn August 2013 two different groups started the process to mount a recall drive against Filner; the two groups later combined their efforts. In order to force a recall election, they would have had to gather more than 100,000 signatures of city voters (15% of the votes cast in the most recent election) within a 39-day window. On August 18, 1,200 volunteers began collecting signatures. Less than a week after the signature drive began, Filner agreed to resign. The recall organizers wound down the effort, called for all petitions to be turned in so they could be counted and destroyed, and worked on preparing a final financial accounting.\n\n\nOn August 21, 2013, city attorney  said that Filner had reached an agreement with the city after three days of mediation. The City Council considered the agreement in a closed session on August 23 and voted 7-0 to accept Filner's resignation. The resignation deal with the City Council limits Filner's \"legal and financial exposure\" by providing a joint legal defense for him and the city for claims filed against him by current or former city employees, as well as paying up to $98,000 of his outside legal fees. Filner signed a letter of resignation that became effective at 5 p.m PDT August 30, 2013. City Council president  served as interim mayor, with limited powers, pending election of a new mayor. A  was held on November 19, 2013; since no candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff election was held on February 11, 2014, wherein  was elected to be the next mayor.\n\n\nOn October 15, 2013, Filner pleaded guilty in San Diego Superior Court to three criminal counts filed against him by the , who took over the case after  recused herself. The charges were one  count of  and two misdemeanor  charges. The victims were identified as three . He could have faced up to five years in prison, but a  was reportedly reached, under which he would be given three months of , three years probation, and partial loss of his mayoral pension. On December 9, 2013, the terms of the plea bargain were imposed at a sentencing hearing. The plea bargain would have prohibited him from ever seeking or holding public office again, but the judge reduced the prohibition so it applies only while he is on probation. He served a three-month term of house arrest which ended on April 6, 2014.\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Filner denied all allegations of sexual harassment.\n\n\nOn November 20, 2017, Representative&nbsp;&nbsp;(D-Colorado)&nbsp;alleged during an interview on MSNBC's '''' that Filner tried to force himself on her in an elevator.\n\n\nFilner is divorced from his first wife, Barbara (Christy) Filner, a retired mediation specialist  whom he met when they both taught in a summer program in the early 1960s at  (then Institute). They have two adult children, a son and a daughter.\n\nFilner was later married to Jane Merrill, but they divorced in 2011.\n\nAt his first news conference after his election as mayor in 2012, Filner introduced his fiancée, Bronwyn Ingram, a disability analyst who worked for the . On July 8, 2013, Ingram announced by email to a group of her supporters that the engagement had been called off and the relationship was over. In a subsequent statement, Ingram cited Filner's verbal abuse and blatant sexting as reasons for the split.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Before his election to the Assembly in November 2010, Donnelly was a small businessman. He resides in . On January 22, 2013, Donnelly announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for  in the . He placed third in the open primary, behind incumbent   and investment banker , who contested the election in November 2014.\n\n\nDonnelly was born in  and raised in , the third of 14 children. Donnelly graduated from  in 1984. He attended the  for a year and earned a  in English from the  in 1989.  After college he worked in a family business. Five years later, Donnelly started his own company.\n\nDonnelly is married to Rowena Donnelly who is of . They have five children.\n\n\nDuring his political career, Donnelly was an \"unabashed  popular among the most conservative GOP stalwarts\" and was a favored candidate of the . He was known as \"the Legislature's most outspoken gun rights advocate and opponent of illegal immigration.\"  described Donnelly as .  His home region, the , is \"arguably the most conservative part of the state.\"\n\n\nIn 2005, Donnelly became involved with the , and founded the Minuteman Party in California. He stepped down from the Minutemen to return to private life in 2006.\n\n\nIn 2009, following the announcement that embattled 59th District Assemblyman  would not seek re-election, Donnelly announced his candidacy. Appealing to  voters, he ran in the 2010 semi-closed primary election, and narrowly won the Republican nomination over  City Councilman Christopher Lancaster, son of former  . He won the general election on November 2, 2010, with 57.3% of the vote, to the Democratic Party nominee's 36.8%.\n\n\nIn March 2011, Donnelly drove three hours from Sacramento to  to appear before the  student senate committee, in an attempt to oust the  Pedro Ramirez, a student in good standing at the university. Ramirez was brought by his parents to the U.S. from Mexico at the age of three. He had been injured after a car crash with a tree in January 2011, and was investigated by authorities for driving without a , a minor infraction; illegal immigrants were not permitted to hold driver's licenses at the time.Gene Maddaus,\n , ''LA Weekly'' (March 22, 2011). Donnelly called for Ramirez's removal, saying that the \"This issue is about breaking the law and driving without a license.\" Donnelly was heckled by students at the hearing.\n\n\nIn September 2012, Donnelly spoke at an  \"Medical Freedom Rally\" with actor , urging Governor  to veto AB 2109, legislation that required parents seeking an exemption for vaccination of their children \"to first talk with a health care provider about the risks and benefits of vaccines.\"Nancy Shute, , NPR (November 9, 2013). The legislation aimed to encourage vaccination and improve vaccination rates in the state. (The legislation retained the ability of parents to reject vaccination for their child on the basis of \"personal belief.\") Brown signed the bill into law, although he added a signing statement indication that parents \"whose religious beliefs preclude vaccination\" should not be unduly burdened.\n\nIn 2015, after outbreaks of  and  the previous year, Governor Brown signed into law SB 277, a mandatory vaccination law that eliminated the \"personal belief\" exemption from school vaccination requirements, leaving a physician-granted medical exemption as the only exemption from vaccination requirements.Ryan Hagen , ''San Bernardino Sun'' (July 1, 2015).Tracey Seipel, , Bay Area News Group (October 7, 2015). One day after Brown signed the bill into law, Donnelly&mdash;who by this point had left the state legislature and become a conservative talk radio host&mdash;filed paperwork to begin signature-gathering in an attempt to place a referendum on the November 2016 California ballot to reverse the legislation. Donnelly characterized the issue as government intrusion on parental rights, and said that concerned over what he claimed was \"the inherent risks of an ever increasing schedule of vaccinations,\" although scientific evidence shows that vaccines are safe and effective. Donnelly's referendum failed to make the ballot, having collected well under the required number of signatures.\n\n\nDonnelly called for an audit of California's  along with Assemblyman , following the case of , who was removed from his parents' home after his parents wanted a second opinion regarding medical treatment. The Joint Legislative Audit Committee voted unanimously to audit CPS in three counties in the state of California on June 5.\n\n\nIn 2013, Donnelly authored AB 351, the \"Liberty Preservation Act.\"  The law prevents \"local entities from knowingly using state funds ... to engage in any activity that aids an agency of the Armed Forces of the United States in the detention of any person within California for purposes of implementing Sections 1021\" of the . The bill achieved overwhelming, bipartisan support in the California Legislature, and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown. The Liberty Preservation Act prevents any state agency from indefinitely detaining American citizens.  Donnelly stated, \"Indefinite detention, by its very definition, means we are throwing away the basic foundations of our Constitution.\" He added, AB 351 \"will prevent California from implementing indefinite detention for any reason.\"\n\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Donnelly had a loaded  handgun while attempting to board an airplane at  in San Bernardino.  security screeners discovered the gun in his carry-on luggage. The gun was not registered to Donnelly. Donnelly said the incident was a \"regrettable\" and \"innocent and honest mistake.\" In March 2012, following a  with prosecutors, Donnelly pleaded  to two  offenses: one count of carrying a loaded firearm into a city without a concealed weapons permit and one count of possession of a prohibited item in a sterile area. He was sentenced to three years of probation, a $2,215 fine, and is prohibited from using, owning or possessing any firearm that is not registered to him.\n\n\nA 2006 speech by Tim Donnelly surfaced in April 2014, in which Donnelly referred to a \"Hispanic insurgency\" which he compared to the war in Iraq.\nThe speech drew strong rebuke from former U.S. Treasurer , who said \"I am just appalled. It's an embarrassment not only to himself but to the party and the efforts I am involved in at the national level … to elect Latino Republicans. This … makes my job that much more difficult.\" \nPrimary Republican opponent  reacted with a statement, \"\"Once again Assemblyman Donnelly's comments are outrageous and divisive. This is not who we are as Republicans and is not who we are as Californians. We need positive leadership that unites us to tackle the serious challenges that California families face.\"\n\n\n\nIn January 2013, Donnelly announced his bid for . Donnelly was endorsed by Hollywood actor .\n\nIn May 2014, during his campaign, a Donnelly campaign associate posted comments on Donnelly's official campaign Facebook page claiming that his Republican primary opponent  had \"supported the United States submitting to the Islamic, Shariah banking code in 2008\" when Kashkari served as  and administered the .Seema Mehta, , ''Los Angeles Times'' (May 6, 2014).  Donnelly's claim drew swift rebukes from other Republicans and Muslim groups. , ''Orange County Weekly'' (May 9, 2014)/ Representative , Republican of California, said: \"As far as I'm concerned, this type of stupidity disqualifies Tim Donnelly from being fit to hold any office, anywhere. California Republican Party vice chair Harmeet Dhillon said that Donnelly's attempt to tie Kashkari (a  of ) to Islamic law was an attempt \"to trade on bigotry, racism, hatred of the other, hysteria.\"  The California chapter of the  condemned Donnelly's anti-Muslim comments and said, \"It is a shame that an elected official uses xenophobic and anti-Muslim rhetoric to discredit a member of his own party.\" Donnelly stood by his remarks.\n\nIn the June 2014 , Democratic incumbent  won with 54.5% of the vote and Republican  came in second with 19.0% of the vote, qualifying for the general election. Donnelly came in third with 14.8% of the vote. Although Kashkari called for Republican unity, Donnelly pointedly refused to ask his supporters to support Kashkari. Brown subsequently won the general election.\n\n\nIn 2015, Donnelly claimed that President Barack Obama was  and that he wanted to see the United States punished. Donnelly referred to Obama as \"Ayatollah Obama\". He pushed the conspiracy theory that the Obama administration is staffed with Muslim Brotherhood members, saying that he was starting to believe \"more and more\" that Obama himself was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Donnelly ran for  against incumbent Republican . He finished third in the blanket primary behind Cook and Democrat Rita Ramirez, with 20.7% of the vote, thereby failing to advance to the general election.\n\n\n\nDonnelly ran again for the  in 2018.

During his campaign announcement in October 2017, Donnelly criticized members of Congress for their alleged failure to support the agenda of President Trump. He finished second in the blanket primary behind incumbent  and advanced to the general election for a Republican vs. Republican battle. Cook defeated Donnelly in the general election.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, incumbent Republican  announced that he will run for the   in 2020 rather than seek reelection.  Donnelly announced that he would be a candidate for the .  He ran on the same issues he emphasized in the last two campaigns he waged.

She served until her death in 1987, after which  won another special election to fill that seat. \n\n\nThe '''' reported: \"After quitting Congress in 1982, Burton cleaned himself up in a rehabilitation center and spent nearly six years in private law practice before returning to where he started in elective office, the California Assembly, in 1988.\"\n\nJohn Burton was returned to the Assembly in a 1988  to succeed , who had been elected  of . Burton then won a full term that fall and was re-elected in 1990, at which time California voters passed term limits restricting Assembly members to three full terms (and state senators to two full terms) from then on.\n\nBurton served the three terms he was still allowed in the Assembly; then, in 1996, he was elected to the state Senate. He was re-elected to a final term in the Senate in 2000. From 1998 to 2004, he served as the  of the Senate. \n\nAs a legislator, Burton was known for expanding the Cal Grant scholarship program, and passing a law (subsequently defeated in a ) that would have required California businesses to pay for health coverage for their workers. The magazine ''California Journal'' said about Burton's departure from the Senate in 2004: \"Gone will be the Senate's most vehement partisan for social services for the poor, the Senate's angriest voice against tax breaks for businesses and the wealthy, its loudest voice for protection of workers, its fiercest pro-labor advocate and its disciplinarian.\"\n\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, Burton formed the John Burton Foundation, an organization that, according to its website, is \"dedicated to improving the quality of life for California’s homeless children and developing policy solutions to prevent homelessness.\"\n\nIn February 2007, he was appointed board member of the .\n\nIn 2008, Burton settled a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment filed by Kathleen Driscoll, then the executive director of his charitable foundation. She claimed Burton sexually harassed her by making unwanted advances, suggestively raising his eyebrows and commenting on her body. At a 2008 news conference in her attorney's office, Driscoll said, \"I had a dream of helping homeless children through a job I loved. John Burton turned that dream into a sexual harassment nightmare and quite frankly a living hell.\" Burton's attorney, Susan Rubenstein, countered, saying, \"John Burton has dedicated approximately a half-century of his life to public service, and if he were a sexual harasser, I think it would have been unearthed by now. I think the allegations are shocking and a shakedown and are absolutely meritless.\" Within hours Rubenstein received information that Driscoll had written or said complimentary things about Burton that contradicted her allegations. In a June 2007 e-mail to another foundation employee, Driscoll had written, \"I love John because his heart is so good and pure.\" Rubenstein continued, \"I just got off the phone with another [person] who felt compelled to tell me that she had lunch with Driscoll and she said Driscoll had nothing but admirable things to say about Mr. Burton.\"\n\n\nOn April 26, 2009, Burton was elected chair of the  (a post he had previously held some 35 years earlier), succeeding . He received roughly 76% of the vote over his sole challenger, Chris Finnie of .\n\nBurton stepped down from his party chairmanship in May 2017. He was succeeded by vice chairman Eric Bauman. At his farewell, he recalled a lesson learned early in life. Near tears he described walking in San Francisco with his father, who doled out whatever money he had to the poor. When John asked why, Burton recalled, \"He put his finger in my face and told me he never ever wanted me to walk past some guy in bad circumstances without leaving something in the cup.\" Burton continued, \"That's what Democrats do. …There’s a lot of people out there that if we don’t fight for them, nobody’s going to fight for them because they don’t have any power.\"\n\nAfter promoting expanded medical care for Californians, he was extolled in a video and by a long line of effusive party luminaries. He was applauded for his decades-long leadership, leading protests against the Vietnam War, his support of Central Valley farmworkers, the homeless, and the needy. He finally ended his comments by raising both middle fingers and saying, \"Fuck [Donald] ,\" to loud applause.\n\n\nBurton was appointed to the  on October 22, 2020 by Mayor of San Francisco .\n\n\nBurton was previously married to Michele (née Hall) Burton, daughter of , a Hawaiian trade unionist, and a healthcare consultant.

After graduation, he worked in the Legislature as a legislative and budget consultant. He then went on to receive his MBA from .\n\n\nFlorez has legislated in areas of clean air, farm worker safety, high-speed rail, and government accountability.

In addition, the state established new guidelines for the purchase of computer and technology related services.\n\nFlorez sponsored SB 700, which required farms, for the first time ever, to comply with provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act. Other legislation phases out the age-old practice of burning agricultural waste while taking into consideration the needs of farmers to find an alternative disposal method by giving biomass facilities added incentive to take farm waste over urban construction debris. SB 700 required permits for agricultural sources that annually emit a certain number of tons of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and/or s (VOC), depending on the air basin.\n\nFlorez also worked to establish a Tsunami Warning System in the wake of the Thai tsunamis that devastated tourism in that area.\n\nFlorez advocated against the importation and application of sewage sludge in his District and has fought against proposed mega-dumps and super-dairies.

Florez spearheaded Measure E in 2006, which banned the spreading of sludge on unincorporated farmland in Kern County. This local measure had bipartisan support.\n\nFlorez promoted farm worker safety.

The Pesticide Drift Exposure Response Act requires the responsible parties to reimburse victims for medical bills related to incidents not covered by existing workers’ compensation laws with pesticide drift.\n\nThe Chronicle for Higher Education has cited Florez's efforts to investigate whether publicly funded schools in California are complying with Federal Title IX requirements to provide equal opportunities for male and female students in athletics and education. Following a $5.85 million sex discrimination verdict against California State University, Fresno, Florez prodded the Senate to create the Senate Select Committee on Gender Discrimination and Title IX Implementation, which he chaired.\n\nFlorez, who represented one of the largest districts in the state, switched to a hybrid vehicle in an effort to save taxpayers money on gas.

He worked to establish public and private partnerships that increased access and affordability to open source materials for college students. As part of the work Florez did with foundation, he advocated for policies to create open source digital libraries for college textbooks. In 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 1052 and SB 1053, laws that were designed to provide students at public postsecondary institutions with access to free digital textbooks for popular lower-division courses.\n\nAfter leaving the 20 Million Minds Foundation, Florez founded Balance Public Relations and Strategies in 2014. Balance Public Relations is a full service strategic consulting firm that supports private and public clients where innovation and regulation intersect. Florez's firm specializes in information technology, impact driven startups, procurement processes, water politics and policy. With deep ties to local, state, and federal leaders, Balance Public Relations has built a foundation with policymakers and stakeholders that has spanned three decades. Over the years, Florez has demonstrated industry-specific expertise in risk management and policy strategy for marketplace startups in the sharing, gig, on-demand, peer-to-peer and collaborative economy. Florez is regarded as a trusted advisor to key internal and external stakeholder groups ranging from executive teams and management, to C-suite, board of directors, investors, and policymakers.\n\nIn 2016, Florez was appointed to the California Air Resources Board, also known as CARB or ARB. CARB is the \"clean air agency\" in California. On CARB, Florez represents social justice communities. Florez was appointed by the Senate Rules Committee, California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León. In 2020, he was reappointed by the Senate Rules Committee, California Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins. Florez has distinguished himself as an advocate for some of the most vulnerable  communities by fighting for clean air policies and for taking bold action on climate change.\n\n\n\n \n\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Napolitano switched races at the last moment and narrowly defeated Casso in the Democratic primary, 51% to 49%.\nA 2009 story first reported by Bloomberg News and further detailed by the ''Los Angeles Times'' questioned the personal loan interest rate that the  authorized Napolitano to use during her 1998 campaign for Congress. Both Bloomberg and the ''Times'' noted that the FEC had accepted the argument that the 18% rate was equivalent to the early withdrawal penalty that Napolitano was subject to by withdrawing $150,000 from her employee retirement fund and then lending that money to her campaign. Both sources also reported the rate dropping to 10% in 2006, and cited FEC filings as of December 31, 2009, indicating that $221,780 in interest had been paid.

Her questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and increasing demands that airlines make of flight attendants. William J. McGee, the country's foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for  responded that this was \"an excellent question because… right now we have a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so there is no question that there is an issue of training as well.\"\n\n\nStatistics showing one in three Latina adolescents contemplated  prompted Napolitano to spearhead a school-based Latina adolescent  program in three local middle schools and one high school.

During his time in the Legislature, Anderson served on the  of the  (ALEC) as California state chair.\n\n\n\nBorn and raised in , Anderson moved to  with his family when he was in high school. Anderson graduated from  with an  in . He attended , and received a  in finance and business administration from the university. He has served within his community as treasurer on the board of the Resource Conservation District of Greater San Diego County, a member of the board of the Water Conservation Garden, director of proceedings of the Alpine Chamber of Commerce, and as a volunteer at River Valley Charter High School.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Anderson campaigned for a seat in the California Assembly but lost the election. In November 2002, he was elected to the Division 5 seat on the Padre Dam Board&mdash;representing Blossom Valley, Flinn Springs, Alpine, Crest and Harbison Canyon&mdash;with 44 percent of the vote while campaigning on the issues of fiscal responsibility and decreasing spending. Anderson criticized incumbent members of the board for excessive travel and for putting together a customer service center that cost more than he believed was necessary. After Anderson was elected, the Padre Dam Board voted unanimously to postpone the building project. In August 2003, the Padre Dam Board voted to build a new office building at the Santee Lakes Recreation Preserve; Anderson voted against the spending measure, and it passed 3–2 with a cost limit of $6 million. In 2006, Anderson was the board president of the Padre Dam Water Board.\n\n\nAnderson was elected to the California Assembly in 2006, as a representative of the 77th Assembly District in East . His campaign issues included border security, combating illegal immigration, decreasing taxes and fighting government waste, and promoting  in order to prevent s residing nearby educational facilities and local parks. He received endorsements in his 2006 campaign, from Republican politicians in San Diego County including , State Senator , and Assemblyman . Helped by those endorsements, he narrowly won a five-candidate primary over  City Councilman Jack Dale by 858 votes, which was tantamount to victory in the general election.\n\n  in 2007]]\nIn 2007, Anderson wrote legislation in the California Assembly which mandated that the two main pension funds in the state must divest from businesses that conduct defense or energy affairs in Iran. The bill required the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System to divest from companies that violated federal law by doing business in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This legislation called for the divestment of more than $24 billion of our public pensions from the Islamic Republic of Iran. This proposal garnered Anderson notice on a national level. AB 221, the California Divest Iran Act, was co-authored by fellow legislators from both main political parties. The bill focused on the  (CalPERS) and the  (CalSTRS), and ordered them to divest from businesses in Iran. Governor Schwarzenegger spoke favorably of Anderson's legislation, and acknowledged that the state should position itself to have a \"powerful stand against terrorism\". In a statement about AB 221, the Governor said, \"California has a long history of leadership and doing what's right with our investment portfolio.\" Governor Schwarzenegger said he would sign AB 221 on the floor of the United Nations during his speech to the General Assembly. Sherry Reser, spokeswoman for CalSTRS said that the pension fund \"will never tolerate support of terrorism\", and acknowledged, \"We will implement the bill.\" James Hawley, co-director of the Elfenworks Center for the Study of Fiduciary Capitalism at  in , predicted that Anderson's legislation would affect other state governments, \"There is political pressure out there. This is going to resonate with a lot of state legislatures.\" Anderson's bill received support from both Jewish and Iranian groups in California. Associated Dean of the  Rabbi Abraham Cooper commented, \"The Iranian regime is up to no good. The only thing that is going to derail them is to hit them in the pocketbook.\" Upon news that the Governor would sign the bill, Anderson stated, \"This is a common sense bill. Money is the mother's milk of terrorism.\"\n\nAnderson proposed legislation in 2007 to give disabled veterans a free pass to attend state parks. The bill passed the Assembly with a 73–0 vote. Democratic State Senator  commented in favor of the legislation, \"It's the public's way of saying thank you.\"  veteran and  resident Bill Manes noted, \"It's just a nice gesture, particularly for those men and women coming back now.\" Anderson put forth an amendment intended to give the same parks benefit to those that had received the . State Senator , a Democrat and the Chairman of the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee, commented in favor of this amendment, \"I'm certainly in favor of extending the privilege to recipients of the Medal of Honor. That makes complete sense.\" On July 27, 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the legislation into law, as Senate Bill 60. Upon signing the bill, Governor Schwarzenegger stated, \"We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude for the contributions they have made to our state and for their dedicated service to our country. This bill is an important step forward in ensuring that these homes become a reality for our many veterans who need them.\"\n\nIn March 2008, Anderson endorsed , the son of Congressman , in his campaign for the . Anderson also served as the chairman of the junior Hunter's congressional campaign. Anderson and his daughter Mary spoke up in support of home schooling in March 2008, after a state appellate court in California issued a ruling that children who are the product of home schooling need to be credentialed. Anderson proposed legislation in the Assembly, ACR 115, which requested of the  to overturn the precedent of the lower court. In 2008, Anderson brought the issue of divestment of funding from businesses related to Iran to the educational institution of the . He brought forward a resolution, ACR 79, which called upon the university to divest its funding and investments relating to any corporations that conduct business operations with Iran. In May 2008, the resolution had successfully passed through the Assembly Appropriations Committee. Anderson commented, \"as a matter of human rights, it is the right thing to do\" to divest from Iran, and also noted it was a fiscally responsible decision.\n\nIn 2009,   signed two bills proposed by Anderson into state law: a piece of legislation which assisted home-schooled children in getting work permits, and another bill that protected some of an individual's equity in their home from liability. In February 2009, Anderson proposed legislation, AB-255, that would mandate blurring detail on  images of areas deemed sensitive locations including schools, places of worship, government buildings and medical facilities. When asked how he had determined the list of locations proposed to be blurred, Anderson commented, \"Well, I looked at where we've had security issues in the past and potentially, might have issues in the future. Churches and synagogues have been bombed. So have federal buildings and then, of course, 9/11. So, the threats are out there and as a state legislator, public safety is my No. 1 job. To ignore that fact would be irresponsible.\"\n\nIn March 2009, Anderson opposed a non-binding resolution that declared the process flawed by which , which had made same-sex marriage unconstitutional in California, was adopted, and described same-sex marriage as discriminatory towards heterosexual marriage. Anderson received a zero percent scorecard rating from gay rights group  for the years 2007 through 2012.\n\nAnderson introduced legislation in 2009 regarding a concern over California's use of s: AB 1506 proposed to allow individuals to utilize California state issued IOUs in order to fund payments towards university education, car payments, and payroll taxes. Anderson said of the proposed legislation, \"Hopefully, this will allow California businesses to stay alive while the state is unable to pay them.\" The bill would mandate that the state must accept its own registered warrants as payment. The bill was considered by the Assembly Business and Professions Committee in July 2009. The bill received unanimous support from the Assembly Business and Professions Committee, as well as bipartisan support from both Republicans and from Democrats in the majority. Democratic leadership member in the Assembly, , commented favorably on Anderson's proposed legislation, \"It is the recipients of these IOUs who are being punished for the actions of the governor and others who have gotten us into this situation. I appreciate what you're attempting to do here.\" After the July 7, 2009 vote by the Assembly Business and Professions Committee, the bill was sent to the Appropriations Committee. Dr. Stuart A. Cohen, president of the San Diego County Medical Society, wrote to Anderson in support of the legislation, acknowledging, \"This bill would save many businesses and individuals from severe financial hardship.\"\n\nAnderson was the only Assembly member to vote against AB2199, which would remove \"the causes and cures of homosexuality\" from the list of mental illnesses and sexual deviancies to be researched by the State Department of Mental Health.\n\nIn an August 2009 interview with '''', Anderson identified private sector growth as a solution to decreasing unemployment and fixing the budget in California, and noted, \"The long-term answer to the budget is to grow private-sector jobs as quickly as possible while stopping all new spending. My colleagues and I are committed to rolling back high taxes and oppressive regulation on businesses, thus encouraging new private-sector jobs.\" He characterized \"a clean spending cap [as] the single most important reform for California that could be passed in a ballot initiative\". On September 12, 2009, Anderson was recognized at a gala event \"Night To Honor Israel\" with the \"Watchman on the Wall\" Award from the organization . The organization recognized Anderson as the Assemblyman, \"who spearheaded California's Iran Divestment initiative\".\n\nIn December 2009, Anderson was fined US$20,000 by the Fair Political Practices Commission in California, relating to solicitations of contributions towards a campaign higher than the legally allowed amount. In an interview about the fine, Anderson stated, \"I made the mistakes, and I corrected them as quickly as possible. We didn't spend the money. Once I realized there was a mistake, we went straight to the FPPC and tried to reconcile it.\"\n\n\nOn March 3, 2010, Anderson announced his intention to run for the  seat. Other candidates in the Republican primary election included  retired  and  School Board member Kenneth Dickson, and  Supervisor . In a statement upon declaring his intention to run for California State Senate, Anderson noted, \"Over the last three years I've carried major legislation. I've worked hard in a bipartisan way to solve California's problems. We have solutions to California's problems, but they aren't all politically correct. I want to be part of that solution.\"\n\nIn the Republican primary for the State Senate, Anderson received endorsements from San Diego Assemblyman , the California Republican Assembly, Congressman , the San Diego Deputy Sheriff's Association, Assembly member , and San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith.\n\nOn June 8, 2010, the day of the Republican primary for the State Senate seat, the  reported: \"Assemblyman Joel Anderson, R-La Mesa, was the early leader to succeed Senate Minority Leader Dennis Hollingsworth\". '''' noted, \"Assemblyman Joel Anderson, R-Alpine, was on pace to top a four-person field in the GOP primary for the 36th Senate District\". The ''North County Times'' reported that Anderson led the candidates in the Republican primary, with his closest opponent receiving 24 percent of the vote. ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'' reported that Anderson had a \"strong lead over his Republican competitors in the East County 36th State Senate District primary race\".\n\nAccording to the paper, with 15 percent of votes counted, Anderson received 45 percent of the votes; other candidates in the Republican primary received 25, 21, and 10 percent.

The ''Valley News'' later posted a new article with the correct results, and deleted the prior incorrect reporting without . The State Senate district is considered a \"Republican stronghold\"; the Democratic candidate in the general election was Paul Clay, who ran uncontested in the primary.\n\nAnderson won the general election by a wide margin.\n\nDuring his term in the Senate, he has opposed any legislation controlling the sale of guns or ammunition. He opposed increased aid to pregnant teens, voted to prevent registered nurses from dispensing contraceptives, and wanted to prevent the inclusion of maternity services in health insurance plans sold in the state. He voted against the minimum wage increase more than once, he opposed requiring overtime pay for agricultural workers, opposes health warning labels on sugary drinks, opposed the sale of medical marijuana, opposed notifying property owners prior to the start of hydraulic fracking on their leased lands, voted not to ban the carcinogen BPA in baby products, voted against requiring mental health coverage by health insurers doing business in the state, voted against the solar power energy credit, voted to keep gender based health insurance pricing so that women would have to pay more for health insurance, and voted to allow the resale of recalled products. He also voted against changing school start times, a statewide sanctuary policy, and recognizing  as a legal gender. On June 1, 2017, he voted against a bill to create a single-payer health plan for the state of California.\n\nOn July 20, 2017, Anderson introduced Resolution SJR-10, a resolution condemning the  of  taking place in the  to the Committee of Rules. It unanimously passed a vote of the Judiciary Committee on August 29.\n\nOn August 30, members of the senate received a letter on the stationery of the Chinese Consulate of  urging the California senators not to support SJR-10, \"so as not to sabotage the friendship and sustainable development between California and China.\" The letter goes further, pointing out the strong economic ties between China and California, such as the high volume of tourism, trade, and overseas students studying in California. The following day, September 1, the resolution was voted on and sent back to the rules committee, blocking it from being voted on in the Senate.\n\nIn August 2018, Anderson was accused of physically and verbally harassing Stephanie Roberson at a fund raising event for the California Nurses Association.

Mendoza represented the communities of Artesia, Buena Park, Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens, Norwalk, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier, Lakewood, Los Nietos, and South Whittier.\n\n\nMendoza authored several bills that were signed and adopted into law while serving in the Assembly, including bills that dealt with health, public safety and the environment.\nAB 97 made California the first state in the nation to ban the use of s in food preparation in all California restaurants, cafeterias and bakeries.  AB 1291 helped parents take a lead role in the life of their child; the child who has been charged and convicted of a first-time gang related offense can jointly enroll with his or her parent or parents in anti-gang courses to prevent further involvement in gang activities.  AB 1488 required smog checks for lightweight diesel vehicles to ensure they are running clean.\n\nMendoza's 2018 legislation was a mix of education, consumer and employment bills.  AB 63 protects consumers by requiring retailers who issue a service contract or extended warranty to maintain a copy on file for the life of the contract, and make it available to a consumer within 10 days of request.\n\nAB 943 would end the practice of using a person's credit report as a part of the hiring process with the exception of positions that deal with large sums of cash or expensive property.\n\nAB 857 would place highly trained individuals from the Employment Development Department (EDD) in  local EDD centers to work face-to-face with individuals on their unemployment benefits.  This bill also would hire an additional 800 people to serve in call centers.  The bill used no state money to fund the program, but instead allocated federal dollars to maintain the level of service to help those transitioning.\n\n\nIn 2008, Mendoza launched the Young Legislators, a student program which put high school seniors from throughout the 56th Assembly District in real-life political scenarios.  The program's goal is to teach high school seniors about the political world.\nSeniors who qualify take part in an eight-month program that introduces them to local, regional and statewide office holders who share their perspectives on various issues, and explain their role in the political process.  Young Legislators conclude their studies by participating in a mock legislative session in Sacramento in which they deliver and deliberate on legislative bills they have designed and introduced.\n\n\n\n\nThe California Fair Political Practices Commission launched an investigation after a series of contributions was made by Tony Mendoza and Assembly Candidate Tony Bermudez. \"Latino Caucus Chairman Assembly Member Tony Mendoza, acting on his own accord and without input from Members of the Latino Caucus, provided a recommendation to transfer $50,000 from Yes We Can, an Independent Expenditure Committee (IEC), to another IEC prior to his resignation as Chair of the Caucus. The funds have since been transferred numerous times and have been used to support candidates who are not endorsed by the Latino Caucus. As the current Chair of the Latino Caucus, I do not condone or support his actions\", said , D-South Gate. Bob Stern, former president of the Center for Governmental Studies, the principal co-author of the California Political Reform Act and the Fair Political Practices Commission's first general counsel, said the transactions look \"very suspicious, but there could be explanations.\" \"Money laundering is the most serious of campaign violations,\" Stern said, noting that money laundering is used to both skirt campaign contribution limits and conceal contributors.\"\n\n\n\nIn November 2017, Mendoza was accused of inviting a young female staffer to his residence in Sacramento. In February 2018, leaders of the State Assembly publicly released the findings of an investigation that determined he likely engaged in a pattern of unwanted advances and sexually suggestive behavior toward six women, including four subordinates, over the last decade. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León introduced Senate Resolution 85, which cites the house's zero-tolerance sexual harassment policy and the results of the investigation as grounds to expel Mendoza. Before the Senate could take a vote for expulsion, Mendoza resigned from his position.\n\n\n\nAssemblyman Mendoza grew up in South Central Los Angeles. He is the first in his family of nine children to graduate from college. He received a bachelor's degree in Political Science from .

Strickland was not endorsed by Craven and the mayor requested that Strickland remove her name from the flyer. With Craven's name removed, only one elected official, Mike Markey, had endorsed Strickland.\n\nIn 1998, the Strickland campaign had a complaint filed against it alleging that a mailer sent out by an independent group attacking Strickland's opponent coordinated with the campaign. The complaint was made by the President of the West Valley Republican Club, Michael Chulak. He claimed that the mailer was illegal because it was sent out \"at the behest\" of the Strickland campaign. The mailer was sent out by a Sacramento-based gun owner's group on Strickland's behalf.\n\nHe was re-elected in 2000 with 51% of the vote, again in a three-way race.

The Commission levied a $3,000 fine.\n\nIn May 2016, Strickland agreed to pay a $40,000 fine to settle a FPPC investigation that determined that he laundered campaign donations during his 2010 run for state controller. The Commission  found that Strickland had routed campaign contributions through the Ventura County Republican Party and Stanislaus County Republican Central Committee, in an effort to evade state limits on campaign contributions. The Commission said that Strickland did not cooperate with the investigation.

In its December 2022 vote, the new conservative-majority council chose Strickland as mayor on a 4&ndash;3 vote, with Van Der Mark being elected mayor ''pro tempore '' on a 4&ndash;3 vote. On December 6, 2023, on a 4&ndash;3 vote, Strickland was succeeded by Van Der Mark, and the ''pro tem'' position went to Burns.Matt Szabo, , ''Los Angeles Times'' (November 30, 2023).Sara Cardine, , ''Los Angeles Times'' (December 6, 2023). In both 2022 and 2023, the council voted 4&ndash;3 to set aside previous council resolutions under which the ''pro tem'' post was granted to the longest-serving councilmember who had not served as mayor in the past four years. During the 2023 vote, Strickland made the motion to set aside this previous custom of selecting the ''pro tem'' based on seniority.\n\nStrickland remains a member of the city council.\n\n\nAs a city councilmember and as mayor, Strickland staunchly opposed increasing housing supply. During his tenure, the city stopped accepting applications for s, which prompted   to sue the city, alleging that the city was violating the  (SB 9), a state law requiring municipalities to allow greater housing supply. The city also sued the state of California, alleging that the state's  infringed on the city's authority; a federal judge denied the city's request for a temporary restraining order blocking the application of state housing law. Bonta said that Huntington Beach's suit was a \"baseless and obstructionist attempt by the city to defy state housing laws.\"\n\nStrickland says that he supports affordable housing but Huntington Beach is \"95% built out\" and he will not support \"anything that guts our suburban coastal community.\" In 2023, he claimed that \"high rise high density urbanization\" was being \"forced\" on the city.\n\nIn 2024, Strickland supported a ballot initiative to allow California cities to impose  on new apartments. Strickland said he did not support rent control as a policy, but would support the initiative because it would enable local governments to impose steep requirements on new housing which would block new housing construction.\n\n\nIn October 2015, Strickland announced the formation of Strong America, a  of which he is president and CEO.\n\n\nStrickland has one daughter and one son with his first wife, , who he married in 1998, though they eventually divorced.

The unit is publicly listed as a state mandated affordable housing unit.

He graduated from  in 1955 and earned a  from the  in 1958, after which he worked as an attorney and was involved in the . He was elected to the  in 1964, during which he became popular in San Francisco and became known as one of the country's most powerful state legislators. As a legislator, Brown earned a reputation as a supporter of civil rights of gays and lesbians and was able to manage colleagues and maintain party discipline. He served as the  from 1980 to 1995. His long tenure and powerful position were used as a focal point of the   of state legislators that passed in 1990. During the last of his three allowed post-initiative terms, Brown maintained control of the Assembly despite a slim  majority. Near the end of his final term, he decided to  for mayor of San Francisco.\n\nDuring Brown's tenure as mayor of San Francisco, the city's budget was expanded, and real estate development, public works, city beautification, and other city projects saw a significant increase. Brown presided over the \"\" era at a time when San Francisco's economy was rapidly expanding. His administration included more Asian-Americans, women, Latinos, gays and African Americans than the administrations of his predecessors. Brown was reelected in , but term limits prevented him from running for a third term, and he was succeeded by his political protégé . '''' called Brown \"one of San Francisco's most notable mayors\", adding that he had \"celebrity beyond the city's boundaries.\" He retired from politics after leaving the office in 2004, published an autobiography, and continued to  and advise politicians.\n\n\nBrown was born on March 20, 1934, in , a small  town in  marked by racial tensions, to Minnie Collins Boyd and Lewis Brown. He was the fourth of five children. During Brown's childhood, mob violence periodically erupted in Mineola, keeping African-Americans from voting. His first job was as a shoeshine boy in a whites-only barber shop. He later worked as a janitor, fry cook and field hand. He learned his strong work ethic at a young age from his grandmother. He graduated from , which he later described as substandard, and left for San Francisco in August 1951 at the age of 17 to live with his uncle.\n\nAlthough Brown did not meet the qualifications for  , a professor at the school facilitated his admission on probation. Brown adjusted to college studies by working especially hard to catch up in his first semester. He joined the Young Democrats and became friends with . Brown originally wanted to be a math instructor but campus politics changed his ambitions. He became active in his church and the San Francisco . Brown worked as a doorman, janitor and shoe salesman to pay for college. He is a member of  fraternity. He also joined the  (ROTC) but later quit the ROTC and joined the 's 126th Medical Battalion, where he was trained as a . Brown earned a  in  from San Francisco State in 1955.\n\nBrown attended University of California, , where he also worked as a janitor. He later said that his decision to attend law school was primarily to avoid being drafted. He befriended future San Francisco mayor , for whom Brown later managed a campaign.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, Brown was one of a few African-Americans practicing law in San Francisco when he opened his own business. He practiced  law, representing pimps, prostitutes and other clients that more prominent attorneys would not represent. One early case was to defend  on his first  arrest. He quickly became involved in the , leading a well-orchestrated sit-in to protest housing discrimination after a local real estate office refused to work with him because of his race.\n\nBrown began his first run for the California State Assembly in 1962 by having local African American ministers pass around a hat, collecting $700. He lost the election by 600 votes before winning a second election in 1964.\n\n\n\nBrown was one of four Black Americans in the Assembly in 1965. The other three were ,  and . He continued to be reelected to the Assembly until 1995. In the 1960s, Brown served as chair of the Legislative Representation Committee, a powerful position that helped him climb the Assembly ranks. He became the Democrats' Assembly  in 1969. Brown also served on the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. In 1972, he delivered a speech at the . He lost his bid for the speakership in 1972. In 1975, Brown authored and lobbied the successful passing of the  that legalized  in California, thus earning the strong and lasting support of San Francisco's . Similarly, he voted against AB 607, which banned same-sex marriage in 1977, further building his reputation as a supporter of the civil rights of gays and lesbians. During the 1970s, Brown continued to expand his legal practice, including the representation of several major real estate developers. He won the Speakership in 1980.\n\nBrown was California's first Black American speaker of the Assembly, and served in the office from 1981 to 1995. In 1990, he helped negotiate an end to a 64-day budget standoff. In 1994, Brown gained the vote of a few Republicans to maintain the Speakership when the Democrats lost control of the Assembly to the  led by . Brown regained control in 1995 by making a deal with Republican defectors  and , both of whom were elected speaker by the Democratic minority.\n\nBrown's long service in the Assembly and political connections, his strong negotiation skills, and the Assembly's tenure system for leadership appointments combined to give Brown nearly complete control over the California legislature by the time he became Assembly Speaker. According to '''', Brown became one of the country's most powerful state legislators. He nicknamed himself the \"Ayatollah of the Assembly\".\n\nBrown was extremely popular in San Francisco, but less so in the rest of the state. Nevertheless, he wielded great control over statewide legislative affairs and political appointments, making it difficult for his conservative opponents to thwart his power. Partially to remove Brown from his leadership position, a state constitutional amendment initiative was proposed and passed by the electorate in 1990, imposing s on state legislators. Brown became the focus of the initiative, and raised just under $1 million to defeat it. The California legislature challenged the law, but the courts upheld it. California Proposition 140 also cut the legislature's staff budget by 30 percent, causing Brown to reduce legislative staff by at least 600. Under current California term-limits law, no  is able to have a longer tenure than Brown's.\n\nBrown gained a reputation for knowing what was occurring in the state legislature at all times. In 1992, he gave $1.18 million to the Democratic Party to help with voter registration and several campaigns, some of which was from contributions from tobacco companies and insurance companies. As Speaker, he worked to defeat the . Critics have claimed Brown did not do enough to raise the legislature's ethical standards or to protect the environment. During his time in Sacramento, he estimates he raised close to $75 million to help elect and reelect state Democrats.\n\nBrown led efforts in the Assembly for state universities to divest from South Africa and to increase  research funding. He helped obtain state funds for San Francisco, including funding for public health and mental health funds. Brown held up the 1992 state budget for 63 days until Governor  added another $1.1 billion for public schools.\n\nBrown had a reputation in the Assembly for his ability to manage people. Republican State Senator  of Fresno noted Brown's ability to \"size up the situation and create, sometimes on the spot, a winning strategy.\" According to Hobson, \"He was a brilliant daycare operator. ... He knew exactly how to hold the hand of his Assembly members. He dominated California politics like no other politician in the history of the state\".\n\n\n\nFrom 1975 to 1978, Brown supported the , led by , while it was being investigated for alleged criminal wrongdoing. Brown attended the Temple perhaps a dozen times and served as master of ceremonies at a testimonial dinner for Jones where he said in his introduction, \"[l]et me present to you a combination of Martin King, Angela Davis, Albert Einstein ... Chairman Mao.\"\n\n\nIn 1995, . In his announcement speech, he said San Francisco needed a \"resurrection\" and that he would bring the \"risk-taking leadership\" the city needed. Brown placed first in the first round of voting, but because no candidate received 50% of the vote, he faced incumbent  in the December runoff. Brown gained the support of Supervisor , who had placed third in the first round of voting. He campaigned on working to address poverty and problems with Muni. He called Jordan the \"inept bumbler\" and criticized his leadership. Jordan criticized Brown for his relations with special interests during his time in the State Assembly. Brown easily defeated Jordan.\n, , and ]]\nBrown's inaugural celebration included an open invitation party with 10,000 attendees and local restaurants providing 10,000 meals to the homeless. President  called Brown to congratulate him, and the congratulations were broadcast to the crowd. He delivered his inaugural address without notes and led the orchestra in \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\". He arrived at the event in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nIn 1996, more than two-thirds of San Franciscans approved of Brown's job performance. As mayor, he made several appearances on national talk shows. Brown called for expansions to the San Francisco budget to provide for new employees and programs. In 1999, he proposed hiring 1,392 new city workers and proposed a second straight budget with a $100 million surplus. He helped oversee the settling of a two-day garbage strike in April 1997. During Brown's tenure, San Francisco's budget increased to $5.2 billion and the city added 4,000 new employees. Brown tried to develop a plan for , but there wasn't enough in the budget to do so. He put in long days as mayor, scheduling days of solid meetings and, at times, conducting two meetings at the same time. Brown opened  on Saturdays to answer questions. He would later claim of his mayorship that he helped restore the city's spirit and pride.\n\nBrown's opponents in his  were former mayor Jordan and . They criticized Brown for spending the city's $1 billion in budget growth without addressing its major problems and creating an environment of corruption and patronage at City Hall.  was a late write-in candidate and faced Brown in the runoff election. Brown won reelection by a 20-point margin. Most major developers and business interests supported him. Ammiano campaigned on a promise that he would raise the hourly minimum wage to $11 and scrutinize corporate business taxes. Brown repeatedly claimed that Ammiano would raise taxes. President Clinton recorded a telephone message on Brown's behalf. Brown's campaign spent $3.1 million to Ammiano's $300,000. The 1999 mayoral race was the subject of the documentary ''See How They Run''.\n\n\nAccording to Brown, although he was scheduled for a flight to New York City on the day of the , he received a \"low key warning\" in a phone call from a member of his airport security detail, who advised him not to fly. Brown disregarded the warning and was waiting for a ride to the airport for an 8 a.m. Pacific Time flight, when he learned of the attacks. He immediately ordered the city to close schools and courts, concerned over the potential for additional terrorist attacks. In addition, he recommended to representatives of other possible targets in San Francisco, including the  and , that they also close.\n\nIn February 2003, Brown's appointed police chief, , and several top  officials were arrested for conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into an incident involving off-duty officers popularly called \"\".\n\n\nBrown ended San Francisco's policy of punishing people for feeding the homeless. San Francisco continued to enforce its policy regarding the conduct of the homeless in public places. In 1998, Brown supported forcibly removing homeless people from  and police crackdowns on the homeless for drunkenness, urinating, defecating, or sleeping on the sidewalk. Brown introduced job training programs and a $11 million drug treatment program. San Francisco, the country's 13th-largest city at the time, had the nation's third-largest homeless population, at a peak of 16,000. In November 1997, Brown requested nighttime helicopter searches in Golden Gate Park. His administration spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating new shelters, supportive housing, and drug treatment centers to address homelessness, but these measures did not end homelessness.\n\nIn 1996, Brown approved the Equal Benefits Ordinance, which required city contractors to give their employees domestic partner benefits. In 1998, he wrote President Clinton a letter urging him to halt a federal lawsuit aimed at closing medical marijuana clubs.\n\n\n\n\nOne of Brown's central campaign promises was his \"100-Day Plan for \", in which he said he would fix the city's municipal bus system in that many days. Brown supported the \"Peer Pressure\" Bus Patrol program, which paid former gang members and troubled youth to patrol Muni buses. He claimed the program helped reduce crime. He fired Muni chief Phil Adams and replaced him with his chief of staff Emilio Cruz. In 1998, Brown was mayor during the summer of the Muni meltdown as Muni implemented the new ATC system and he promised riders there would be better times ahead. A voter-approved initiative the next year helped improve Muni services. Brown increased Muni's budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure. He later said he made a mistake in overpromising with his 100-Day Plan.\n\nBrown helped mediate a settlement to the 1997  strike.\n\nDuring his first term as mayor, Brown quietly favored the demolition and abolition of the  to accommodate the redevelopment of the site for market-rate housing. Centrally located at First and Mission Streets near the  and , the terminal originally served as the San Francisco terminus for the electric commuter trains of the , the  of streetcars and the  railroads which ran on the lower deck of the . Since the termination of streetcar service in 1958, the terminal has seen continuous service as a major bus facility for  commuters;  buses transport riders from the terminal directly into neighborhoods throughout the inner East Bay. The terminal also serves passengers traveling to San Mateo County and the  aboard  and  buses respectively, and to tourists arriving by bus . Today, the terminal is being planned for redevelopment as a regionwide mass transit hub maintaining the current bus services, but with a new tunnel that would extend the  commuter rail line from its current terminus at Fourth and Townsend Streets to the site.\n\n\n\n\nSince 1992, cyclists riding in San Francisco's monthly  bicycle rides had used the  technique at street intersections to block rush-hour cross-traffic. In 1997, Brown approved  Chief 's plan to crack down on the rides, calling them \"a terrible demonstration of intolerance\" and \"an incredible display of arrogance.\" After arrests were made when a Critical Mass event became violent, Brown said, \"I think we ought to confiscate their bicycles\" and \"a little jail time\" would teach Critical Mass riders a lesson. On the night of the July 25, 1997, ride, 115 riders were arrested for , jailed, and had their bicycles confiscated.\n\nBy 2002, Brown and the city's relations with Critical Mass had changed. On the 10th anniversary of Critical Mass on September 27, 2002, the city officially closed down four blocks to automobile traffic for the annual Car-Free Day Street Fair. Brown said of the event, \"I'm delighted. A new tradition has been born in our city.\"\n\n\nAs mayor, Brown was criticized for aggregating power and favoring certain business interests at the city's expense as a whole. Supporters point to the many development projects completed or planned under his watch, including the restoration of City Hall and historic waterfront buildings; the setting in motion of one of the city's largest ever mixed-use development projects in , and the development of a second campus for the . In contrast, critics objected to the construction of many   buildings in formerly working-class neighborhoods that they believed led to  and displacement of residents and .\n\nUnder Brown, City Hall was restored from damages sustained during the . He insisted on restoring the light courts and having the dome gilded with more than $400,000 in real .  was redeveloped and the Mission Bay Development project began. Brown also oversaw the approval of the Catellus Development Corp., a $100 million restoration of the century-old , the new , the new , the expansion of the  and 's new international terminal. Brown worked to restructure the . He helped established an AFL-CIO housing trust to build affordable housing and worked to increase the city's share of federal and state grants. He oversaw declining crime rates and improvements in the city's economy, finances, and credit ratings during his first term.\n\nBrown was known for his shrewd and strategic use of the planning process's details to affect and facilitate development projects on his watch. In regard to a parking garage on Vallejo Street desired by North Beach and Chinatown merchants, he circumvented neighborhood opponents of the garage by ordering demolition of the site's existing structure to commence on a Friday night and be done by Monday morning, when the group was certain to try to obtain a restraining order. \"It was with the demolition permit I outsmarted them\", Brown said, claiming that as the critics rushed toward court, \"someone shouted out to them that the building had disappeared over the weekend. They've never recovered from that little maneuver.\"\n\nDuring his mayoralty, Brown hoped to build a new stadium for the  and worked with them to create a plan. No new facility was built for the team during his tenure. Brown worked with the  to build a new stadium in the  after previous stadium measures had failed on the ballot. The stadium was approved by San Francisco voters in June 1997 and opened in 2000.\n\nDue to vacancies on the Board of Supervisors before 2000, Brown was able to appoint eight of the board's 11 members. Due to a change in San Francisco's election laws that took effect in 2000, the board changed from at-large to district-based elections, and all seats on the board were up for election. The voters elected a new group of supervisors that ran on changing the city's development policy. Voters also passed a measure that weakened the mayor's control over the Planning Commission and Board of Appeals. The new majority limited Brown's power over the Elections Department, the Police Commission, and extending San Francisco International Airport's runways into the bay to reduce flight delays.\n\n\nAllegations of political patronage followed Brown from the state legislature through his mayoralty. Former Los Angeles County GOP assemblyman , who voted in 1994 to keep Brown as speaker, was reassigned to a position with a six-figure salary as head of San Francisco's solid waste management program.  was also appointed to a position by Brown. Both were hired as special assistants after losing their Assembly seats because they supported Brown. Former San Francisco supervisor Bill Maher was also hired as a special assistant after campaigning for Brown in his first mayoral race. Brown is also accused of favoritism to Carolyn Carpeneti, a philanthropic fundraiser with whom he had a child. In 1998 Brown arranged for Carpeneti to obtain a rent-free office in the city-owned . Between then and 2003, a period that included the birth of their daughter, Carpeneti was paid an estimated $2.33 million by nonprofit groups and political committees, though not all this money went directly to Carpeneti.\n\nBrown increased the city's special assistants payroll from $15.6 to $45.6 million between 1995 and 2001. Between April 29, and May 3, 2001, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reporters  and Chuck Finnie released a five-part story on Brown and his relations with city contractors, lobbyists, and city appointments and hires he had made during his mayoralty. The report concluded that there was an appearance of favoritism and conflicts of interest in the awarding of city contracts and development deals, a perception that large contracts had an undue influence on City Hall, and patronage with the hiring of campaign workers, contributors, legislative colleagues, and friends to government positions.\n\nThe  investigated Brown when he was speaker. One investigation was a sting operation concerning a fake  attempting to bribe Brown; he was not charged with a crime. The FBI further investigated Brown from 1998 to 2003 over his appointees at the Airport Commission for potential conflicts of interests. Brown's friend, contributor, and former law client Charlie Walker was given a share of city contracts. Walker had previously thrown several parties for Brown and was among his biggest fundraisers. He had served jail time in 1984 for violating laws concerning minority contracting. The FBI investigated Walker. The FBI also investigated Brown's approval of expansion of  and SFO. Scott Company, with one prominent Brown backer, was accused of using a phony minority front company to secure an airport construction project. Robert Nurisso was sentenced to house arrest. During Brown's administration, there were two convictions of city officials tied to Brown. Brown reassigned Parking and Traffic chief Bill Maher to an airport job when his critics claimed Maher should have been fired. Brown also put his former girlfriend Wendy Linka on the city payroll.\n\nBrown's romantic relationship with Alameda County deputy district attorney  preceded his appointment of Harris to two California state commissions in the mid-1990s. The '''' called the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the California Medical Assistance Commission patronage positions. When the appointments became a political issue in Harris's 2003 race for District Attorney, she responded: \"Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work\". Brown's relationship with Harris gained renewed attention in early 2019 after she had become a U.S. senator and ran for president. Brown addressed the questions by publishing a piece in the '''' titled \"Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?\" He wrote that he may have \"influenced\" her career by appointing her to boards and supporting her run for District Attorney, but added that he had also influenced the careers of other politicians. Brown noted that the difference between Harris and other politicians he had helped was that \"Harris is the only one who, after I helped her, sent word that I would be indicted if I 'so much as jaywalked' while she was D.A. That's politics for ya.\"\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the mayor's office, Brown considered running for the  but ultimately declined. From January through September 2006, he hosted a morning radio show with comedian  on a local San Francisco  affiliate. He also does a weekly . Brown established The Willie L. Brown Jr. Institute on Politics & Public Service, an unaffiliated nonprofit organization at . It trains students for careers in municipal, county and regional governments. The center will be one of the first to focus on local government in the country. Brown gave its library a collection of his artifacts, videotapes and legislative papers from his 40 years in public office. He is also planning to mentor students, teach a course on leadership, and recruit guest speakers.\n\nOn February 5, 2008,  released Brown's hardcover autobiography, ''Basic Brown: My Life and Our Times'', with collaborator P. J. Corkery. The book release coincided with California's   on the same day. On July 20, 2008, Brown began writing a column for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', a move that drew the ire of some ''Chronicle'' staff members and ethicists for the failure to disclose multiple conflicts of interest.\n\nIn 2009, Brown was defending general construction contractor Monica Ung of . Accused of flouting labor laws and defrauding immigrant construction workers of their wages from laboring on  municipal construction projects, Ung was arraigned on dozens of felony fraud charges on August 24, 2009, in Alameda County Superior Court. Brown's decision to defend Ung angered many in the East Bay's labor community.\n\nIn September 2013, the western span of the Bay Bridge was officially named for Brown. In early 2015, he was named to the  of the San Francisco-based  company Global Blood Therapeutics.\n\nBrown has often been associated with former California governor , who served for seven years after the end of Brown's mayoralty. In retirement, Brown continued to participate in  for and advising other politicians.\n\n\nIn late 2012, Brown became the regulatory lawyer for , a ride-sharing service. In that capacity, he represented the company before the , which was creating new regulations to legalize the ability of  to operate ridesharing services in California.\n\n\nAs mayor, Brown was often portrayed mockingly but affectionately by ists and s as a vain emperor, presiding in a robe and crown over the kingdom of San Francisco. He enjoyed the attention this brought to his personal life, disarming friends and critics with humor that directed attention away from the policy agendas he was pursuing.\n\nBrown's flamboyant style made him so well known as the consummate politician that when an actor playing a party politician in 1990's '''' did not understand director 's instruction to model his character after Brown, Coppola fired the actor and hired Brown himself to play the role. Brown later appeared in 2000's '''' as a judge. He also played himself in two  films, '''' and '''', and in the 2003 film '''' as the mayor of San Francisco. He appeared as himself, alongside , in an episode of ''''.\n\nBrown was criticized in 1996 for his comments that 49ers backup quarterback  was \"an embarrassment to humankind.\" He was criticized in 1997 for responding to  player  choking his coach  by saying, \"his boss may have needed choking.\"\n\nIn 1998, Brown contacted the Japanese television cooking competition , suggesting San Franciscan Chef  to battle one of the Iron Chefs. Brown appeared on the telecast himself.\n\nBrown remained neutral in the 2008 presidential campaign. He has worked as a radio talk show host and a pundit on local and national political television shows and is seen as attempting to build credibility by abstaining from endorsing candidates for office. \"I've never been high on endorsements,\" Brown said. \"When you get one, all it does is keep the other guy from getting one. Really, what did getting John Kerry's endorsement do to help Barack Obama?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 1958, Brown married Blanche Vitero, with whom he had three children. He has four grandchildren and a step-granddaughter. According to a 1984 ''New York Times'' article, Brown and Vitero separated amicably in 1982. James Richardson, a reporter for '''', said of Brown, \"The measure of his flamboyance is he'll go to a party with his wife on one arm and his girlfriend on the other.\"\n\nBrown also has a daughter, Sydney Brown, with philanthropic fundraiser Carolyn Carpeneti.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1995, Brown dated , who worked as an  deputy district attorney at the time. In 1994, Brown appointed Harris to two different commissions - the  and the  Medical Assistance Commission. Their relationship gained renewed attention in early 2019 after she had become a U.S. senator and ran for president.\n\n\nWhile serving as Assembly speaker, Brown was diagnosed with  (RP), a disease that has no cure and would slowly destroy his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown's two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, \"Having RP is a challenge. As Speaker of the Assembly it was very important that I recognize people in the halls of the legislature. But I couldn't see people unless they were right in front of me. I needed to have the security people give me notes to tell me who was in the room. Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means having to use more of your brain functionI listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands.\"\n\n\n\nBrown has long expressed himself through personal style, which contributed to his visibility and was turned to political advantage. Even in high school he was fastidious about his appearance. In office, Brown became famous for British and Italian suits, sports cars, nightclubbing, and a collection of dressy hats. He was once called \"The Best Dressed Man in San Francisco\" by .\n\nIn his 2008 autobiography ''Basic Brown'', he described his taste for $6,000 Brioni suits and his search for the perfect chocolate . In one chapter, \"The Power of Clothes: Don't Pull a Dukakis\", Brown writes that men should have a   for each season: one with \"a hint of green\" for springtime, another with more autumnal threading for the fall. He adds, \"You really shouldn't try to get through a public day wearing just one thing. ... Sometimes, I change clothes four times a day.\"\n\n\n* 1990:  of the \n* 1996: Brown received the Golden Plate Award of the \n* 2014: Legacy Award of the \n* 2018: Lifetime Achievement Award, Greater Los Angeles African American Chamber of Commerce\n* 2018: NAACP's \n* 2024: Inducted into the \n\n\n* '''' (1990)\n* '''' (1997) as himself, \n* '''' (2000)\n* '''' (2001) as himself, \n* '''' (2003)\n* '''' (2008)\n* '''' (2015)\n* ''I'm Charlie Walker'' (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* Holst, Arthur Matthew. \"Brown, Willie.\" In ''African American National Biography'' vol. 2, edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham.

Lara was elected during the , defeating former California insurance commissioner .\n\nLara previously served in the  from 2012 to 2019 as a , representing the . Prior to that, he served in the , representing the .\n\n\nBorn in , Lara is the son of a formerly undocumented factory worker and seamstress from Mexico. Lara attended  schools and graduated from , where he earned a  degree and served as student body president. In 2013, Lara completed Harvard University's  program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a  LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow.\n\nA longtime Assembly staffer, Lara worked as Chief of Staff to Assemblyman  (D–South Gate) when Firebaugh served as Majority Leader. Lara later served as 's district director during Nuñez's time as . He then served as communications director for Assemblyman  (D–Los Angeles).\n\n\n\n\nLara was a candidate for the Assembly in 2008, seeking the Democratic nomination in the Los Angeles-based 46th district. He faced a number of well-connected challengers, including , the cousin of Los Angeles mayor . Following a meeting at , Villaraigosa's official residence, Pérez became the consensus candidate and the other candidates, including Lara, dropped their campaigns. Although the challengers' names remained on the ballot, Pérez won the primary comfortably and took the seat before being elected to the Speakership in late 2009.\n\nLara was subsequently appointed by Villaraigosa to the powerful Los Angeles Planning Commission, where he served until resigning to focus on his 2010 Assembly run in the 50th district. Running for the seat required Lara to move into the district, which at the time did not include any part of the city of Los Angeles. Because Los Angeles planning commissioners are required to be residents of the city of Los Angeles, Lara could not run for the 50th Assembly district while serving on the commission. He announced his candidacy for the seat in early 2009 and became a resident of Bell Gardens.\n\n\nLara faced three primary challengers in his 2010 Assembly bid, two of whom had held elected office in the district. With the support of the state and local Democratic parties as well as the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, Lara prevailed handily. He faced a Republican opponent in the general election and won overwhelmingly.\n\n\nLara was sworn in as an assemblyman on December 6, 2010, and was appointed the chairman of the joint legislative audit committee.

Lara swiftly lined up a number of endorsements, including from Congresswoman , the  and the California Latino Legislative Caucus, the last of which declared the race their number one target seat. An opinion poll also showed Lara favored to win the seat, giving him a 6-point lead over Lowenthal. Two weeks after Lara's entry into the race, Lowenthal dropped her bid for the Senate and announced that she would instead seek re-election to the Assembly.\n\nLara was reelected to the Senate in 2016 with 78.6% of the vote.\n\n\nLara has passed legislation for cleaner air, to expand healthcare, and to protect the civil rights of Californians. He was author of the Super Pollutant Reduction Act (Senate Bill 1383) in 2016, which created the nation's toughest law on black carbon, methane, and fluorocarbons that contribute to global warming. Lara wrote Senate Bill 4, Health for All Kids, which became the basis for 2015 budget action that led to healthcare for nearly 200,000 undocumented immigrant children under California's  program.\n\nIn the 2017 legislative session, Lara introduced the Healthy California Act (Senate Bill 562) with Senator  to create a  plan that replaces private insurance with a publicly run plan that covers all Californians, including an estimated 2.7 million uninsured and as many as one-third of Californians who are underinsured.

These laws included protections for wildfire victims against losing their home insurance to cancellation or nonrenewal, the decriminalization of sidewalk vending, and the nation's first  law.\n\n\n\n\nOn March 21, 2017, Lara announced he was running for  in 2018.\n\n\"I'm running to be California's next state insurance commissioner because I believe at my core that California needs a strong defender, and a counterpuncher, who will stand up to fight our bullying President, , and his increasingly reckless federal government on issues from healthcare access to economic security and more,” Lara said in a statement.\n\nOn November 6, 2018, Lara narrowly led former Republican Insurance Commissioner , who ran as an .

In 1989 she obtained a  degree in management from the , under the  program.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1980, Fiorina joined  as a management trainee, selling telephone services to big federal agencies. In 1990, she became the company's first female officer as senior vice president overseeing the company's hardware and systems division, eventually heading its North American operations.\n\nIn 1995, Fiorina led corporate operations for Lucent Technologies, Inc., a  from AT&T of its  and  divisions into a new company.  In that capacity, she reported to Lucent chief executive . She played a key role in planning and implementing the 1996  of a successful stock and company launch strategy.  The spin-off became one of the most successful IPOs in U.S. history, raising 3 billion.\n\nLater in 1996, Fiorina was appointed president of Lucent's consumer products sector. In 1997, she was named group president for Lucent's 19 billion global service-provider business, overseeing marketing and sales for the company's largest customer segment. That year, Fiorina chaired a 2.5 billion joint venture between Lucent's consumer communications and , under the name  (PCC). In the edition of October 12, 1998, of '''' magazine, Fiorina was named \"The Most Powerful Woman in American Business\".\n\nLucent added 22,000 jobs and revenues grew from US$19 billion to US$38 billion and the company's market share increased in every region for every product. According to Fortune magazine,  Lucent increased sales by lending money to their own customers, writing that \"In a neat bit of accounting magic, money from the loans began to appear on Lucent's income statement as new revenue while the dicey debt got stashed on its balance sheet as an allegedly solid asset\". Lucent's stock price grew 10-fold.\n\n\n\n\n, August 2, 2004.]]\nIn July 1999,  named Fiorina chief executive officer, succeeding  and prevailing over the internal candidate . Matthew Boyle of ''Fortune'' magazine said of Fiorina's hiring as HP's first woman CEO that, \"Carly Fiorina didn't just break the , she obliterated it, as the first woman to lead a FORTUNE 20 company.\"\n\nWriting in ''Fortune'' magazine in August 2015,  described the hiring as  the result of \"a dysfunctional HP board committee, filled with its own poisoned politics, hired her with no CEO experience, nor interviews with the full board.\" Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors, including: 65 million in restricted stock to compensate her for the Lucent stock and options she left behind, a 3 million signing bonus, a 1 million annual salary (plus a 1.25–3.75 million annual bonus), 36,000 in mortgage assistance, a relocation allowance, and permission (and encouragement) to use company planes for personal affairs. Fortune also named her the most powerful woman in America for five consecutive years.\n\n\nAlthough the decision to spin off the company's  division pre-dated her arrival, one of her first major responsibilities as chief executive was overseeing the separation of the unit into the stand-alone . Fiorina proposed the acquisition of the technology services arm of  for almost 14&nbsp;billion, but withdrew the bid after a lackluster reception from Wall Street. Following the collapse of the , the PwC consulting arm was acquired by IBM for less than 4&nbsp;billion.  HP later acquired , another technology services company, which some considered a validation of Fiorina's strategy.\n\n\nIn early September 2001, in the wake of the bursting of the , Fiorina announced the acquisition of PC maker Compaq with 25 billion in stock, which, at the time, was the second largest producer of personal computers, after Dell.  HP stock traded down by 30% on the news of the merger. The Compaq merger created the world's largest personal computer manufacturer in terms of units shipped.\n\nFiorina was frequently at odds with HP's board of directors, and she had to fight with the board for the merger.  Walter Hewlett (the son of company co-founder ) was a source of particularly strong opposition. Hewlett originally voted with the other board members to approve the Compaq deal, but he later changed his mind.  He launched a  against Fiorina's efforts which Fiorina won with a  \"razor-thin margin\" of 51.4% of the shareholders, with the institutional shareholders providing the bulk of the support. Fiorina was supported in the proxy battle by other board members, including Richard Hackborn, , , and Robert Knowling. Fiorina proceeded to reorganize HP and merge the parts of it that she kept with Compaq.\n\nThe merger was met initially with almost universal skepticism. The February 7, 2005, issue of ''Fortune'' described her merger plan as \"failing\" and the prognosis as \"doubtful\". Business professor Robert Burgelman and former HP executive vice president, Webb McKinney, who led HP's post-merger integration team, analyzed the merger and concluded that it was ultimately successful. In 2008, former acting CEO of Compaq  stated that although Fiorina lacked the skills to run the merged company, her successors made it work. HP was able to integrate Compaq's operations and emerge as the world's largest seller of personal computers. The industry soon fell into decline, leading to further difficulties for the company. HP eventually wrote off 1.2 billion from the acquisition as the personal computer market declined. Looking back, a 2011 ''The New York Times'' article described it as \"one of the more questionable deals of the time.\"\n\n\n\nIn 1997, prior to Fiorina's joining the company, HP's Dutch subsidiary formed a partnership with a company in Dubai, Redington Gulf, which sold HP's products in . Under Fiorina's leadership at HP, the company sold millions of dollars worth of printers and computer products to Iran through the foreign subsidiary, while U.S.  were in effect. After the story was initially reported by '''' in 2008, the  sent a letter of inquiry to HP, who responded that products worth 120 million were sold in fiscal 2008 arguing that the sales did not violate export sanctions because they were made through a foreign subsidiary. According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP was using a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary. HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry.\n\n\nIn a September 2015 interview with , Fiorina said that, in the weeks following the  in 2001, she received a phone call from , then the , asking her assistance in providing HP computer servers to the NSA for expanded surveillance.Michael Isikoff, , Yahoo News (September 28, 2015). Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of , a 2001–2007 , but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina \"acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the , where they were escorted by NSA security\" to the agency's  headquarters. In 2015, Fiorina said: \"I felt it was my duty to help, and so we did,\" adding, \"They were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats. ... What I knew at the time was our nation had been attacked.\" Hayden also requested that Fiorina provide advice to the agency \"on how the CIA could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness.\" According to Fiorina, she advised the agency to be \"as transparent as possible, about as much as possible\".\n\n\nFiorina's predecessor at HP had pushed for an outsider to replace him because he believed that the company had become complacent and that consensus-driven decision making was inhibiting the company's growth.  Fiorina instituted three major changes shortly after her arrival: replacing  with bonuses awarded if the company met financial expectations, a reduction in operating units from 83 to 12, and  consolidating back-office functions.\n\nFiorina faced a backlash among HP employees and the tech community for her leading role in the demise of HP's egalitarian \"\" work culture and guiding philosophy, which she felt hindered innovation. Because of changes to HP's culture, and requests for voluntary pay cuts to prevent layoffs (subsequently followed by the largest layoffs in HP's history), employee satisfaction surveys at HPpreviously among the highest in Americarevealed \"widespread unhappiness\" and distrust, and Fiorina was sometimes booed at company meetings and attacked on HP's .\n\nAccording to '''', Fiorina and others have argued that she \"laid the groundwork for some of HP's progress under her successors\", and that she shook the culture at HP so that it could compete in the Internet Age.\n\n\n\nIn January 2004, Fiorina announced an agreement with  founder  for the a   sold through HP's retail channels. As part of the agreement, HP was forbidden from selling a competitor to the iPod until August 2006 and HP agreed to pre-install  on every computer sold. Two days before Fiorina announced the HP+iPod, Jobs announced a new product, the , catching Fiorina off guard. HP did not sell the newer versions of the iPod in a timely fashion, leaving them to sell an outdated device for several months. In addition, Apple began selling its own iPods through the same retail channels. As a result, at the peak of the program, iPod+HP sales represented only a small portion of total iPod sales. In July 2005, soon after Fiorina resigned as CEO, her successor  ended HP's agreement with Apple, within days of taking office, a \"highly symbolic decision\" that was well-received as a return to innovation by HP.\n\n, writing in 2015 on the agreement, wrote that \"Steve Jobs blithely mugged her and HP's shareholders. By getting Fiorina to adopt the iPod as HP's music player, Jobs had effectively gotten his [iTunes] software installed on millions of computers for free, stifled his main competitor, and gotten a company that prided itself on invention to declare that Apple was a superior inventor. And he lost nothing ...\"Benjamin Snyder, , ''Fortune'' (October 1, 2015).\n\n\nIn January 2001, HP laid off 1,700 marketing employees. In June 2001, Fiorina asked employees to either take pay cuts or use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs, resulting in more than 80,000 people signing up and saving HP 130 million. Despite these efforts from employees, in July Fiorina announced that 6,000 jobs would be cut, the biggest reduction in the company's 64-year history,30 million Gulfstream IV, employees joke they can't order books and supplies.|date=December 4, 2001}} but those cuts would not actually occur until after the Compaq merger was announced. In September 2001, Fiorina said she intended to cut an additional 15,000 jobs in the event of a merger with Compaq.\n\nIn all, Fiorina  30,000 U.S. employees. According to '''', those 30,000 layoffs were \"as a result of the merger with Compaq....\"  By 2004 the number of HP employees was about the same as the pre-merger total of HP and Compaq combined, and that 2004 number included roughly 8,000 employees of other companies acquired by HP since 2001.Farley, Robert. ,  (September 17, 2010): \"According to SEC filings, HP had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. That comes to a total of 148,100 workers. In 2005, just after her departure, HP's worldwide workforce reached 150,000. Net gain?  In the Los Angeles Times story, reporter Robin Abcarian said that statement is dubious, because 'in that same period, HP bought more than a dozen other U.S. companies with at least 8,000 employees, according to company filings, press releases and news reports.'...It's clear that Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers as a result of the merger with Compaq, as she said in the interview with InformationWeek. And it's clear that by October 2005 the merged company employed more workers than the two separate companies had pre-merger (Fiorina had been forced out seven months earlier in February 2005). But some of those jobs may have resulted from acquisitions, and some may have been abroad.\"Abcarian, Robin. , '''' (May 20, 2010): \"According to HP's government filings, the company had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. Together the two companies would have a total workforce of 148,100. But in that same period, HP bought more than a dozen other U.S. companies with at least 8,000 employees, according to company filings, press releases and news reports. And in 2005, when Fiorina was fired, the company reported a worldwide workforce of 150,000.\"Kessler, Glenn. ,  (May 8, 2015): \"[T]he number of [HP] employees was 84,800 in 1999 and 151,000 in 2004, according to the 10-K reports. On paper, that certainly looks like an increase in jobs.  But before the merger with Compaq, HP had 86,200 employees and Compaq had 63,700 employees. That adds up to 149,900. HP's filings show that the combined company had 141,000 employees in 2002 and 142,000 employees in 2003. By 2005, the number was 150,000. In other words, the number of employees barely budged from the pre-merger totaland people lost jobs as a result.  The ''Los Angeles Times'', evaluating Fiorina's record when she ran for the Senate in 2010, noted that during her tenure HP also acquired more than a dozen other companies with at least 8,000 employees.

By contrast, stock prices for  and  fell by  27.5% and 3% respectively during this time.  The Compaq acquisition was not as transformative as Fiorina and the board had envisioned: in the merger proxy, they had forecasted that the PC division of the merged entities would generate an operating margin of 3.0% in 2003, while the actual figure was 0.1% in that year and 0.9% in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, HP fell dramatically short of its predicted third-quarter earnings, and Fiorina fired three executives during a 5 AM telephone call. In early January 2005, the Hewlett-Packard board of directors discussed with Fiorina a list of issues that the board had regarding the company's performance and disappointing earning reports.  The board proposed a plan to shift her authority to HP division heads, which Fiorina resisted strongly. A week after the meeting, the confidential plan was leaked to ''The Wall Street Journal''. According to ''BusinessWeek'''s Ben Elgin, directors were also concerned about the board's inability to work effectively with Fiorina.\n\nLess than a month later, the board brought back  and forced Fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company.

He also authored legislation which would give small businesses a safe harbor for correcting deficiencies in  warnings without being subject to financial penalties and lawsuits, the first substantive Prop. 65 reform ever.

He introduced a bill to restrict the ability of government to store indefinitely the blood and DNA of newborn children and to crack down on government selling the blood to for-profit researchers for experimentation without the knowledge of parents.  He teamed up with Kerri Kasem, daughter of , to author a bill allowing adult children of seniors to obtain visitation rights for their loved ones. With , he authored SB 34, which cracked down on government monitoring of citizens using .\n\nAlso in 2015, Gatto authored a major probate reform bill that allows homeowners to pass their property to loved ones without hiring a lawyer, paying to create a trust, or facing the cost and bureaucracy of probate.

Mayes became a businessman at 23, working as a stockbroker at the  office he opened.\n\n\nMayes served on the Yucca Valley Town Council from 2002–2011, and was twice elected by the council to serve as mayor.\n\nIn 2004, Mayes and then-councilman  voted against a proposed 42-percent pay increase for town elected officials. In his final budget as Mayor, Yucca Valley spent $8.7 million, a slight decrease from the previous year, and had over $5 million in reserves.\n\nIn 2011, Mayes resigned as a member of the town council to focus on his responsibilities as  to   Janice Rutherford, saying he found it \"difficult to keep up with the basics of serving as a council member,\" and that \"Yucca Valley deserves a council member who will give them 100 percent every day.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Mayes ran for the  to succeed term-limited Republican , who ran unsuccessfully for Congress that year.  Mayes defeated former   Gary Jeandron in the primary and was elected to the State Assembly in November 2014, with 57.3% of the vote. He was appointed Vice Chair of the Assembly Human Services Committee and a member of the Committees on Governmental Organization, Insurance and Rules, as well as the Special Committee on Legislative Ethics.

Mayes was also appointed by  to serve on the , which works to improve accessibility by fostering dialogue between the disabled and business communities.\n\nDuring his first year in office, he introduced , which provides an orderly process for municipal disincorporation, , which would create a body to holistically examine the state's regulatory environment, and , which would have reduced the California State Fire Prevention Fee for residents who also pay for fire prevention at the local level. All three bills received unanimous bi-partisan support in their policy committee hearings.\n\n\nMayes was selected by his colleagues to serve as Assembly Republican Leader on September 1, 2015 succeeding Assemblywoman . Mayes became Assembly Republican Leader effective January 4, 2016. Mayes was the Member who challenged the notion of poverty in California by stating that \"California has the highest poverty rate in the nation.\" The fact checking website Politifact.com labeled Mayes statement as \"True\". To promote his assertion, Mayes placed professionally produced advertisements that were delivered digitally throughout California.\n\nAs one of his first actions as Leader, Mayes took the entire Assembly Republican Caucus to visit St. John's Program for Real Change to meet with mothers who have emerged from abuse, poverty and homelessness. Later, Mayes negotiated with Governor Brown and legislative Democrats to craft a health plan tax package designed to draw down in more than a billion dollars in matching federal money.

Mayes, along with six other Assembly Republicans and one Republican in the State Senate, voted for the bill alongside almost all of the Democrats in both chambers, and Governor  signed the bill into law. The effort was viewed by conservative activists as a vote in favor of more government regulations and increased taxes, and after multiple county parties officially called on Mayes to step down as Assembly Minority Leader, the state board of the California Republican Party did the same. On August 24, the Republican caucus announced the removal of Mayes as the Minority Leader, and he was succeeded by  on September 15.\n\n\nFollowing a series of devastating wildfires caused by electric utility equipment, including the 2018 , Mayes was among the first to call for the creation of a wildfire catastrophe fund. Under California's unusual  liability standard, utility  was expected to be liable for $30 billion in damages resulting from fires caused by its equipment; this led the utility to file for bankruptcy, calling into question whether the utility would be able to pay claims. Recognizing the need to protect both fire victims and utility ratepayers, Mayes’s plan would create a fund to pay claims to victims following a catastrophic event. In 2019, Mayes authored , the first legislation introduced to create a wildfire catastrophe fund, and also authored , which created a $21 billion fund to pay claims following a major wildfire.\n\n\nOn December 6, 2019, Mayes left the Republican party and filed for re-election as an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2018, Mayes formed \"New Way California,\" aiming to broaden the appeal of the Republican Party by advocating for \"individual freedom, shared responsibility, educational excellence, environmental stewardship, efficient government and an open economy.\" The group has been publicly supported by former governor , and both Mayes and Schwarzenegger – along with   – headlined the group's inaugural summit in  on March 21. The summit featured several other Republicans from the State Assembly, including , , and .

The case ultimately settled with the company prohibited from operating absent stringent new health and safety requirements.\n\nIn 2014, Feuer charged two businesses for polluting as a part of an effort to clean up neighborhoods near schools. He also formed a strike force to combat illegal dumping, Feuer settled a dispute regarding the City of LA's responsibility for dust pollution in the Owens Valley.\n\n\nTo prevent , Feuer created the Gun Violence Prevention Unit in his office. Feuer has brought charges against parents who did not properly store firearms which later fell into the hands of their children. Working with the LAPD, he created protocols to assure domestic violence perpetrators do not have weapons. He has also advocated for the use of gun violence restraining orders, leading educational trainings after the law passed in California in 2016. Feuer joined with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. to co-found and chair Prosecutors Against Gun Violencean independent, non-partisan coalition devoted to prosecutorial and policy solutions to the public health and safety crisis of gun violence. After the Parkland shooting, he formed a Blue Ribbon Panel on School Safety to evaluate and recommend ways to enhance efforts by Los Angeles Unified School District to keep students safe from violence, particularly gun violence, both in schools and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2019, a federal judge blocked the City of Los Angeles and Feuer from enforcing a law that would require contractors seeking to do business with the city to disclose ties to the . Feuer had vigorously defended the law.\n\n\nFeuer has challenged a range of Trump Administration policies on immigration. He confronted federal officials at LAX in an attempt to secure the release of detainees held because of , more widely known as the Trump Administration's Muslim Travel Ban. In April 2018, Feuer successfully petitioned for an injunction against the Federal Government stopping the Trump Administration from tying funding to immigration considerations. Feuer's office led other cities and counties to oppose the Administration's efforts to end the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nIn addition, in 2015, he instituted a program to protect immigrants from fraud.\n\n\nFeuer put in place criminal justice reforms including a street-based approach to address drug use, mental health and treatment, and a neighborhood-based restorative justice program that recruits volunteers to help reduce repeat offenses.\n\n\nFeuer's office has worked to combat the unlawful discharge of homeless patients, reaching $4&nbsp;million in settlements with hospitals, nursing facilities and medical centers in eight such cases. His office established programs to eliminate fines and warrants that could impede a homeless person from receiving shelter or a job, and a program that sends teams including a nurse, mental health expert and substance abuse expert to encampments to intervene with at-risk people experiencing homelessness.\n\nIn 2019, Feuer filed an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to grant review for ''Martin v. Boise'', a case from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. The ''Martin'' decision held that the \"enforcement of ordinances that prohibit sleeping or camping on public property against homeless individuals is unconstitutional when those individuals do not have a meaningful alternative, such as shelter space or a legal place to camp.\" Feuer sought a clarification of this ruling, but the Supreme Court denied the request for review.\n\n\n\nIn response to the , which had a , Feuer's office targeted price gouging for essential supplies, false advertising claims about fake test kits, preventions and cures, and potential s at party houses. Feuer also launched a campaign to help victims of domestic violence trapped with their abusers. enforced the Los Angeles Mayor's Safer at Home Order, and worked to prevent anti-Asian hate incidents fueled by references to the \"Chinese flu\".\n\n\nIn the wake of  following the , Feuer announced he would not prosecute peaceful protesters. Instead, Feuer offered protesters the chance to participate in a series of conversations with police and others to promote reconciliation. Having previously been a recipient of substantial donations from the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union of the Los Angeles Police Department, Feuer insisted that this would not represent a conflict of interest. Feuer said he would prosecute those who engaged in looting, vandalism or acts of violence.\n\nFeuer's office had previously filed charges against protesters, including prominent Black activists, after their arrests during  meetings. These include Los Angeles' only homeless elected official \"General\" Jeff Page, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder and  professor , and longtime civil and human rights activist and labor organizer Greg Akili. Akili, a member of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles' Action Committee and a cofounder of the United Domestic Workers Union, filed a $4&nbsp;million lawsuit in 2017 against the City of Los Angeles, the LAPD, and others regarding his arrest at a 2016 Commission meeting and subsequent prosecution. After his conviction for resisting arrest, Akili said Feuer could have avoided the \"political trial\" by dropping the charges against him.\n\n\nFeuer's office waged a successful fight for transparency in how ratepayer dollars are spent by DWP trusts. He also successfully advocated for City Council to revoke consideration of a taxpayer subsidy to a real estate developer whom the city had previously sued for unpaid taxes.\n\n\nFeuer's office has prosecuted cases of animal hoarding, endangerment and abuse, and practicing veterinary medicine without a license.\n\nHe has conducted public awareness campaigns to warn the public not to leave their pets alone in their cars, and to be aware of puppy scams online.\n\n\nFeuer has supported access to medical marijuana, with some limitations. In 2013, Los Angeles voters passed Proposition D, restricting the locations where medical marijuana could be sold. Thereafter, in 2014, Feuer announced that he was targeting medical marijuana dispensaries and a medical marijuana home-delivery service Nestdrop run by smartphone app. Feuer believed there was a voter mandate from Proposition D, saying that the voters \"felt there were too many dispensaries  and there are too many, too close together and too close to sensitive sites like schools, playgrounds and child care centers\". Feuer closed half of the city's marijuana dispensaries and filed a complaint against Nestdrop seeking to prevent them from providing home-delivery of medical marijuana.\n\nSome criticized Feuer for his actions, with  spokesman Kris Hermes saying that Feuer \"should be figuring out ways to improve access instead of figuring out how to shut down dispensaries\", and asserting that delivery services \"developed because of local officials who are trying to shut down dispensaries\" and \"are a way that people with mobility problems can get their medicine\".\n\n\n\nOn March 9, 2020, Feuer announced his candidacy for .

In the general election, Hahn defeated Steve Napolitano to succeed  to become the next Los Angeles County supervisor from the 4th district. She was sworn in on December 5, 2016.\n\n\nHahn was born in Los Angeles and raised in a politically involved family. She is the daughter of Ramona Belle (née Fox) and , a career member of the  who also served on the .\n\nHer uncle, , was a member of the  and a Los Angeles City Councilman from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Her brother, , served as Los Angeles City Controller from 1981 to 1985, City Attorney from 1985 to 2001 and Mayor of Los Angeles from 2001 until 2005. Hahn's maternal grandparents served as missionaries in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nHahn attended  in Texas, earning a  in education in 1974.\n\n\n\n\nShe taught at the Good News Academy, a private school in Westchester from 1974 to 1978. Her other work in the private sector has included Public Affairs Region Manager at  from 1995 to 2000; Vice President for  in Public Finance, Director of Community Outreach for Western Waste Industries, and Director of Marketing for the Alexander Haagen Company.\n\n\nHahn was elected to represent the Fifteenth District on the Los Angeles Charter Reform Commission, serving from 1997 to 1999. As a Commissioner, she fought for many of the reforms included in the new charter, including Area Planning Commissions, local representation on the citizen commissions governing Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of Los Angeles, and a system of neighborhood councils.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, U.S. Congresswoman  declined to run for re-election, choosing instead to run for . Hahn then won the Democratic nomination to succeed Harman, but lost the general election to Republican State Assemblyman  49%-47%.\n\n\n\nHahn served on the Los Angeles City Council, representing the 15th District, from 2001 to 2011. The 15th District encompasses the San Pedro Harbor and includes the ethnically diverse communities of , , ,  and . She was reelected to her third and final term in November 2009.\n\nShe has been called \"one of the most pro-labor members\" of the City Council, and a \"consistent opponent of layoffs and furloughs for city workers.\" Hahn walked the picket lines with unionized dockworkers in 2002. After the  suggested it would intervene in the labor dispute by using government troops to operate the ports, Hahn urged non-intervention. \"'There's no room for the federal government. There's only one reason for them to get involved, and that's to break the union', she said.\" She was the leading force on the City Council behind both the passage of a living wage ordinance for the hotel workers along Century Boulevard near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the provision of improved health benefits to LAX employees.\n\nHahn cites her efforts to clean up the Port of Los Angeles as one of her main accomplishments while on the City Council. The 2006 Clean Air Action Plan, which she and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed forward, set a goal of reducing pollution by 45 percent within five years and shifted the movement of goods at the ports to off-peak traffic hours. Hahn supported the addition of the Clean Trucks Program that requires the 16,000 diesel trucks serving the ports meet 2007 EPA emission standards within five years. She has noted that the ports have been Southern California's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and diesel emissions and that the Clean Trucks Program also provides for improved working conditions, wages and benefits for port truckers. Prior to the Clean Air Action Plan, she had already shifted about 35% of goods to be moved during off-peak hours. Hahn also helped advance redevelopment projects at the Port of Los Angeles in both San Pedro and Wilmington.\n\nOn the City Council, Hahn was a major proponent of gang prevention, intervention, and suppression programs. She led the campaign to pass Measure A, which would have dedicated a sustainable revenue stream for those programs, but fell just shy of the two thirds percentage needed to pass. On a smaller level, she expanded the Gang Alternatives Program to all elementary schools in her district.\n\n\n\nHahn ran for  in 2010 but was defeated in the Democratic primary by San Francisco Mayor , finishing second in a field of three candidates. She received 33.3% of the vote against Newsom's 55.5%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n on July 19, 2011.]]\nOn February 7, 2011, Hahn announced her intention to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in the special election to fill California's 36th congressional district seat vacated by U.S. Representative 's departure to head the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\n\nHahn was one of sixteen candidates from all parties who competed in the  on May 17, 2011. She finished first with 24 percent of the vote; Republican Craig Huey finished second with 22 percent. Because no candidate received more than 50 percent, Hahn and Huey, the top two finishers, faced off in a special runoff election on July 12. Many had expected   to secure one of the top two spots, but Bowen finished in third place.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, , endorsed Hahn in March 2011, a move the '''' called \"significant\" because of the fundraising and get-out-the-vote power of the large organization. As of March 23, 2011, Hahn had received endorsements from Senator , Los Angeles Mayor , Los Angeles County Sheriff , California Assembly Speaker , California State Senator , Torrance Firefighters Association Local 1138, and other notable figures such as former   and environmentalist and actor \n\nOn April 25, 2011, Hahn secured the endorsement of the ''''.

Her final margin of victory was 9 points, 54.56 percent to 45.44.\n\n\n\nAfter redistricting dismantled her old district, Hahn decided to run in the newly redrawn , which included her home in San Pedro. That district had previously been the 37th, represented by fellow Democratic Congresswoman . The  endorsed Hahn.\n\nIn the all-party primary (created as a result of ), she finished first over Richardson by a wide margin, taking 60 percent of the vote to Richardson's 40 percent. This was all the more remarkable since Hahn was running in territory that was more than 60 percent new to her. In the general election, Hahn defeated Richardson with 60.2 percent of the vote to Richardson's 39.7 percent.\n\n\n*\n*\n\n;Caucuses:\n*PORTS Caucus\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\nHahn voted on Nov. 19, 2015, for HR 4038, legislation that would effectively halt the resettlement of refugees from Syria and Iraq to the United States.  Hahn supports the conversion of dangerous Modified Hydrofluoric Acid (MHF) at refineries to a safer alternative.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Hahn supported the appointment of Nicole Tinkham as interim public defender, despite a letter signed by 390 public defenders who were concerned that Tinkham lacked criminal law experience and the potential for a conflict of interest, given Tinkham’s prior representation of the .\n\n\nSome of the awards received by Hahn include the Rosa Parks Award from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Bold Vision Award from the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, the Public Service Award from the African-American Chamber of Commerce, the Recognition Award from the Harbor Area Gang Alternative Program, and enshrinement on the Promenade of Prominence in Watts.\n\n\nHahn is a lifelong resident of Los Angeles and lives in San Pedro.

Serving over two million students on 112 college campuses, the statewide system is divided into 72 community college districts, overseen by locally elected Boards of Trustees.  Retiring from that position in late summer 2012, Scott became a scholar in residence at Claremont University on September 17, 2012.\n\n\nIn 1996 Scott was recruited by state Democrats to run for  against vulnerable incumbent  (R-Pasadena).

He faced off against fellow assemblyman  from neighboring Glendale in the Democratic primary. Considered more of a gadfly and complainer, Wildman was not supposed to be much of a match for the savvier Scott. He nevertheless made the race close, scoring 46.7% of the vote to Scott's 53.3%. Scott then had little trouble winning the general election and didn't even have a major party opponent in 2004.\n\nWhile serving in the state Senate, Scott chaired the Senate Committee on Education and also chaired the Senate Budget Subcommittee on Education.  He introduced legislation that would ban  balloons in response to the  complaining about hundreds of  caused by these kinds of balloons. This had led to protests, led by  hosts . The Senate eventually passed an amended version of the bill that would raise the penalty for selling a balloon without a proper weight attached and require the balloon to have a warning about the risks of the balloon coming in contact with power lines.\n\nCalifornia State Term Limits prevented Scott from seeking reelection in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott and his late wife, Lacreta (1934-2021), have five children, eleven grandchildren and fourteen great grandchildren.\n\n\nScott is very active in gun control.

He has been a member of the  since 2019, representing , and served as President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from January 8, 2021 to January 8, 2023. Walton earlier served on the  and was its president immediately prior to his election as supervisor.\n\n\nWalton was raised by his mother in . His teenage years were often troubled, having been expelled from the  and served in  numerous times.\n\nWalton graduated from  in 1998. He received his master's degree in public administration from  in 2010.\n\n\nWalton was elected supervisor for District 10 on , receiving 9,550 first preference votes (41.22 percent of all valid votes). After allocation of preferences from eliminated candidates in San Francisco's  system, Walton received 63.07 percent of final-round votes, compared to runner-up Tony Kelly's 36.93 percent. He was sworn in at the Board of Supervisors' January 8, 2019 meeting, replacing , who was ineligible to run for re-election after  and had been elected to the .\n\nThe Board elected Walton to Board President in 2021.\n\n\nWalton was the only San Francisco Board of Supervisors member to explicitly reject a potential plan to allow four-plexes in San Francisco in areas previously restricted to single-family housing (which had been implemented in the neighboring city of Sacramento). He stated that the Sacramento bill \"would speed up the gentrification\" and \"this policy is bad for San Francisco.\"\n\nIn 2019, Walton supported a resolution that expressed opposition to California , which mandates denser housing near “job-rich” areas and transit hubs.\n\n\nIn December 2018, Walton and supervisor  put forth legislation calling to close San Francisco's  by December 2021.\n\nIn June 2020, during the nationwide , he introduced a resolution to ban the  and  from hiring officers with a history of serious misconduct. In October, he introduced the CAREN act, which would make fraudulent s motivated by  illegal.\n\n\nIn February 2020, Walton put forth a resolution calling for  for the city's African American population. The resolution itself forms a working group that will further develop the plan.\n\nIn July 2022, Walton admitted to using a racial slur against an African American sheriff's cadet at San Francisco City Hall because he was frustrated with having to take off his belt for metal detectors. Walton was later determined by the city's human resources director to have retaliated against the cadet for filing a report, in violation of city policy.\n\nIn 2024, Walton passed an ordinance which declares Vietnamese as an official language of San Francisco. As a rationale for the change, Supervisor Walton stated, \"San Francisco is home to many diverse immigrant communities and is a national leader in providing language access services with one of the strongest and most comprehensive local language access laws.\"\n\n\nIn July 2020, Walton and supervisor  opted to not introduce a $100 million sales tax measure into the November 2020 ballots to finance , which has seen a 95% reduction in ridership due to the . Ride fares account for 70% of the service's operating budget. The supervisors cite the lack of shared authority on the Joint Powers Board over the train line's management, which was operated by the , and the  of the sales tax to fund operations for a service whose customer base has a mean income of $120,000 as pain points to supporting the measure. However, Peskin mentioned that the measure can still be introduced by the mayor or other supervisors if they wanted to. The supervisors later changed their minds when Caltrain pledged to make changes to its structure, making it more independent from SamTrans.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, John F Kennedy Drive in  was made car-free. Walton and  opposed making the JFK Drive car-free after the pandemic. Walton argued that keeping the street car-free was segregationist and recreational . Data obtained by the  showed that no district showed a change in its proportion of overall visits to JFK Drive by more than 1.5% during the pandemic, with Walton's District 10 showing a decrease of 0.3%.\n\n\nWalton is a Christian.

She represented San Francisco's  on the  between 2011 and 2019. She is a member of the San Francisco's Democratic County Central Committee. She is executive director of the California .\n\nPrior to her election to the Board of Supervisors, Kim was a member and then president of the . In 2016, she ran for the , but lost to  in a  after finishing first place in the primary. She was a candidate for mayor in the , finishing third with 24.03% of the first-round vote.\n\nShe was the California political director and national regional political director for ' 2020 presidential campaign.\n\n\nJane Kim was born in  on July 9, 1977, to South Korean parents who immigrated to the U.S. from  in 1971.\n\nKim grew up learning both the English and Korean languages. Her mother owned a store selling women's clothing. Her father joined Kiss Products, a global cosmetics company, while she was in college.  At age 14, Kim began studying , eventually earning a . She was involved with community activism, especially the issue of . While attending , a New York prep school, she stopped reciting the  in her teensshe rejected the Pledge words \"with liberty and justice for all,\" because she saw that LGBT people were not treated equally.\n\nKim graduated from  with a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Asian American Studies. She settled in San Francisco and attended the . Kim earned a J.D. degree and was admitted to the  in 2009.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from Stanford, Kim worked as a Fellow at  in San Francisco and then as a Youth Community Organizer at the  (CCDC). Reverend Norman Fong, who interviewed her, took a risk in hiring Kim as she was not Chinese American and did not speak Chinese but “she won him over.” Kim successfully led a youth volunteer and leadership program in  for six years. Through her community organization efforts, she met power broker .\n\nIn 2005 Kim was elected president of the San Francisco People's Organization (SFPO), made up of many notable San Francisco activists and organizers. SFPO worked against several s in November 2005, and assisted with health care and affordable housing measures for San Franciscans through 2006.\n\n\n. She became the first Korean American elected official in the city's history.]]\nIn 2003 while campaigning for   , Kim observed that Asian Americans were not well represented in San Francisco politics despite the size of its population. In 2004, she decided to run for the . In a field of 12 candidates seeking four seats, Kim came in seventh place; her bid failed in part because she was a member of the minority Green Party and did not have the backing of the . In 2006, Kim mounted a stronger campaign and she came in first in a field of 15 candidates seeking three seats. Kim was the top vote getter in every district except Marina/Cow Hollow, West of Twin Peaks and Castro/Noe Valley. In 2007, she became the first Korean American elected official in San Francisco. Kim's election was part of a more liberal shift in the school board joining Fellow Green , , and Kim-Shree Maufas.\n\nIn 2006, the school board took up the issue of whether to continue the 90-year-old  (JROTC) program in San Francisco high schools. The board voted to phase out the JROTC program over two years. In December 2006, previous to taking office, Kim learned about a death threat against her that was sent from a JROTC cadet to his friend on Facebook. The cadet had also used  to threaten a high school girl who argued prominently against JROTC. Kim spoke to the cadet herself and reported that he sincerely regretted his actions. Kim took the position that the JROTC program should not be hosted by San Francisco as long as the U.S. military continued its \"\" policy. In June 2008 Kim and  submitted a proposal to accept JROTC programs as optional after-school activities, without giving students  (P.E.) credit toward graduation. In October, Kim proposed an alternative program called Student Emergency Response Volunteers (SERV) that would train students in emergency preparedness and disaster relief. The bid to remove or replace JROTC failed in a 3–4 vote held in May 2009.\n\nIn March 2008, Kim and Sanchez traveled to Israel as members of the U.S. Green Party to investigate whether the party should continue to support the  program targeting Israel for its occupation of Palestine. Kim complimented a  program near Haifa, recommending its director be brought to San Francisco to help train educators.\n\nKim re-registered with the Democratic Party in 2008 after  was elected president.\n\nIn 2010, she was elected president of the Board of Education. As board president, Kim had to negotiate statewide budget cuts that resulted in a two-year shortfall of $113&nbsp;million for San Francisco schools. She authored and led the first district-wide Restorative Justice Program to address the disproportionate suspension and expulsions of African American students and won a pilot to establish ethnic studies classes in all San Francisco public high schools. Kim stated that the program will “be a cost savings to the district if we’re able to retain more students” and that there is “flexibility to find funding” in a budget of $400&nbsp;million.\n\n\nKim had lived in various neighborhoods of San Francisco, including Polk Gulch and the Sunset. She moved to District 6 in 2009 and subsequently ran in the  election to fill the seat being vacated by Supervisor . District 6 includes , , , , , , , , , , and . Kim announced her candidacy in January 2010, then she kicked off her campaign in June, at a party attended by former mayors  and , as well as the President of the Board of Supervisors, , who knew Kim from having shared housing for more than two years. Kim ran against several candidates, including , who was endorsed by mayor , and liberal Debra Walker, who was endorsed by the Democratic Party and most labor unions. When Brown contributed $5000 to the Kim campaign, some of her progressive supporters questioned whether Kim was being supported by a . Kim's campaign was seen as having the approval of Rose Pak, but the California Democratic machine of the 1960s and '70s was \"dormant\".\n\nKim won the race for supervisor in an upset victory. When she was sworn in she became the first Korean American  in the nation. She told '''' magazine that without the backing of labor unions and the media, and with her own Democratic Party endorsing her opponent, the only strategy she had available was the \"old-fashioned\" one of visiting as many constituents as possible. This was called Kim's \"Fifty-Nine Precinct Strategy\" (referring to 's ) because of the many neighborhoods of the district that were targeted. Less support came from the Korean community, who participated little in the election, than from Chinese American supporters, especially senior citizens in Chinatown, and a broad base of San Francisco youth.\n\n\nKim stood up during the  at Board of Supervisors meetings but refused to recite it in keeping with the decision she had made in her youth. Within a few weeks of being sworn in, her silence gained the attention of local and national news media. She said in 2011 that the words \"liberty and justice for all\" were not yet a reality for many in the United States including communities of color, the LGBT community, immigrants and women. Kim said she was committed to \"helping our nation achieve those ideals.\" On July 10, 2013, following the  decision in '''', declaring unconstitutional the federal  (DOMA), Kim recited the Pledge along with the other supervisors. Kim said that, for her, DOMA had \"symbolized th[e] inequity\" of American justice.\n\n\n and Supervisor Kim pose with Jessica Robinson Love, left]]\nTwitter is an online  that was headquartered in District 6 on Folsom Street when Kim took office. In January 2011, Twitter announced it was considering moving a few miles south to the city of  because the company was expanding and needed ten times more space. Mayor  indicated that he wanted Twitter to stay, so Kim led a team made up of mayoral staffers and Supervisor  to quickly shape a proposal which she sponsored in early February: Twitter would benefit from a six-year payroll tax exemption on net new jobs if it moved into the neglected and distressed mid-Market Street neighborhood of Kim's district. Talks centered on the company moving to the old Furniture Mart, a large  office building vacant since 2008. Kim's tax break proposal would apply to any large company willing to settle in the economically depressed area. Observers felt that this, Kim's first proposal as supervisor, signaled a break with her previous progressive record, to show a pro-business aspect. Former supervisor Chris Daly was critical; he said the plan could not help the city's budget shortfall, a serious problem resulting in jobs and services being cut. Agreeing with this assessment, Local 1021 of the  (SEIU) also opposed the plan. Other businesses expressed anger that they would be unable to take advantage of the tax break. The city Controller's Office reported that the difference between Twitter leaving entirely or moving to mid-Market with the tax break was possibly worth $54&nbsp;million in added revenue spread over 20 years.\n\nIn April 2011, the Board of Supervisors voted to approve the payroll tax exemption plan. Two weeks later, Twitter signed a ten-year lease on the Furniture Mart building. The Twitter tax break remained a defining issue in the : Incumbent Lee supported the exemption while challenger  criticized it. Lee retained his seat in the election. By June 2012, Twitter had settled 800 employees into the new location renamed Market Square, and Kim was invited to visit. She posted a photo of Twitter's new \"micro health kitchen\". Other tech companies such as  and  took advantage of the payroll tax exemption plan.\n\n\n]]\nIn 2010, Supervisor  represented District 5, which shared a border with District 6. Mirkarimi, a fellow ex-Green Party member and progressive politician, accompanied Kim one day during her District 6 door-to-door campaigning in the border area.\n\nMirkarimi was elected sheriff in 2011, but he was soon embroiled in a controversy regarding violence allegations that he had restrained his wife by grabbing and bruising her arm. For this he was suspended by Mayor Lee. About two out of three San Franciscans polled said they thought Mirkarimi should not be reinstated as sheriff. Despite this popular sentiment, in October 2012, Mirkarimi was reinstated through the votes of four progressive supervisors: Kim, Avalos,  and . Kim said she voted to reinstate Mirkarimi because his wrongdoing was less than that described by the city charter as grounds for removal. On the other hand, she said she would support a  to remove Mirkarimi by popular vote. '''' columnist  criticized Kim's position as that of a \"political weathervane,\" unworthy of a leader. '''' editor Steven T. Jones was more supportive, describing how Kim was persistent in questioning Deputy City Attorney Sherri Kaiser to determine what misdemeanor might be considered too small for the mayor to dismiss any elected official. Kim explained to her supporters that her decision was based on Mirkarimi not abusing the power of his office to commit wrongdoing, a point required by the city charter. She also expressed her worry that the case would have set a  allowing the mayor too much power over elected officials. '''' columnist Joe Eskenazi suggested that Kim's support for Mirkarimi kept her out of the running for president of the board of supervisors in 2014.\n\n\nIn March 2013, after Polish labor organizer  made anti-gay remarks, Kim announced that she would seek to rename San Francisco's tiny Lech Walesa Street. The narrow one-way street was originally named Ivy Street but was changed in 1983 to honor Wałęsa. Kim suggested that  co-founder  be honored instead of Wałęsa, especially since the Tom Waddell Health Center was at that location. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to change the name as Kim proposed.\n\n\n in 2010]]\nKim has tackled several issues regarding the use of bicycles in San Francisco. While serving on the Board of Education, she supported new bike racks for eight middle schools, and she promoted Bike-to-School Day. Though she never rode a bike in her childhood or at college, Kim told the  in 2010 that she had been introduced to the city's \"bike culture\" and was slowly learning how to ride, a process that heightened her awareness of  concerns. In 2011,  she rode as a passenger on the rear of an extended bike, but on May 10, 2012, she pedaled herself to . With Mayor Lee, Kim backed the Yerba Buena Street Life Plan which was announced in 2011 for the area around  in District 6. The plan included new bike paths and more bike parking. In September 2013 when the  was criticized for its investigation of a cyclist fatality that happened the previous month, Kim requested a hearing to discuss improvements for such police procedures. Along with Supervisors Yee and Avalos, in January 2014 Kim called for the city to adopt a multifaceted bicycle and pedestrian safety initiative modeled after the Swedish  program. Kim ushered the most protected bike lanes, 18.6 miles, of any San Francisco Supervisor during her time.\n\n\nSan Francisco supervisors had previously tried unsuccessfully to reform the process by which a citizen could use the 1970  (CEQA) appeals process to challenge a building project on the basis of its environmental impact. In 2012 Supervisor  proposed new rules that would restrict such challenges. Bicycling advocate Ben Christopher was supportive of Wiener's proposal, citing one instance in 2005 when a single citizen held up the city's comprehensive bicycle plan. However, critics such as the  said the proposed changes would weaken CEQA's protections. In April 2013 Kim proposed a competing set of reform rules which Eric Brooks of the Green Party reported as \"more CEQA friendly.\" Wiener and Kim hammered out a proposal combining elements of both versions; this was passed unanimously by the Board in July 2013. Kim said the reformed rules would not prevent the public from \"giving input\" to construction projects.\n\n\nIn September 2016, Kim authored the Evictions Protections 2.0 bill to protect tenants from \"no fault\" evictions, which had seen an uptick. This rise in \"no fault\" evictions coincided with a spike in market rent, causing landlords to evict tenants in rent controlled units in order to rent spaces at the higher market rate. 83% of the city's evictions were no fault evictions. \n\nThe ordinance prohibits landlords from evicting tenants for small infractions, dubbed “gotcha evictions,” such as leaving shoes or strollers in the hall, painting a bedroom, hanging laundry out to dry, etc. The bill also removed lease restrictions created by landlords on roommates that are less than the maximum number of persons permitted by applicable laws, such as the SF Housing Code.\n\nThe legislation was co-sponsored by Supervisors Campos, Mar, and Avalos and was passed on October 14, 2015.\n\n\nIn April 2015, the  and Mayor Lee announced a large community development proposal, Mission Rock, to replace the parking lots near , where the baseball team plays. The proposal required voter approval in November 2015. In May 2015, the Giants announced that 33% of the project would be devoted to affordable housing, to match Mayor Lee's goal for all new construction. Kim determined that a larger proportion of the project should be devoted to affordable housing, and she drafted a competing ballot initiative with the assistance of  (TODCO), a non-profit community housing planning group. The danger of a competing ballot initiative brought the Giants to negotiate. Kim and the Giants worked out a deal to increase the project's affordable housing to 40%, and Kim dropped her own ballot initiative.\n\nIn 2021, Kim was involved in efforts to lobby against the construction of a 495-unit apartment complex  on a parking lot next to a BART station in San Francisco which only committed to 14.5% affordable units on-site for residents who make between 50-110% AMI (individuals who earn $45,000-93,000/year, unaffordable to low-income residents in South of Market and Tenderloin). The next year, a proponent of project filed an ethics complaint against her, alleging that she worked as a lobbyist for TODCO in opposing the housing project. Kim was reported to be a paid employee for TODCO, supplying TODCO-prepared materials to the Board of Supervisors. Kim responded that she advocated against the housing project on her own time. City ethics regulations bar ex-officials from lobbying on issues that they covered while in office.\n\n\nIn April 2016, Kim proposed that tuition should be free at  (CCSF), which had seen a 30% decline in students over the previous four years, had lost $35&nbsp;million in state funding tied to attendance, and was in danger of losing its accreditation and more state funding. Some 20% of the college students had already been granted a fee waiver by the City of San Francisco; Kim said that these students should also have free books, transportation and child care.

She is the first person since  to assume the post without having been born a  citizen. She is the only foreign-born Treasurer of the United States.\n\n\nMarin was born Rosario Spindola in , . Her father Mariano, a worker in a label-making factory in , brought his family to the United States in 1972 on visas provided by his employer.Richard Marosi,  ''Los Angeles Times'' (February 25, 2004).Lisa Friedman,  ''Pasadena Star-News'' (May 26, 2003). Via ''WRNHA.org''.  The move was initially resisted by Marin due to her upcoming '''' and her fear of leaving behind her customs and traditions.Charles Dew and David Everett,  ''Latino Leaders'' (December 1, 2003).  Marin's family settled in  where her father obtained work as a janitor and her mother as a seamstress.George Skelton,  ''Los Angeles Times'' (February 16, 2004).The American Program Bureau,   (profile) ''APBSpeakers.com''. Accessed on July 26, 2009.  They returned briefly to their old home in Mexico to celebrate a \"small fiesta\" in her honor.Audrey Fischer,  ''The Library of Congress'' (November 2002).\n\nHer poor command of English was another reason that Marin had resisted coming to the U.S. In high school, she was given an IQ test on which she scored a 27 out of 100 and was subsequently labelled as mentally disabled. This low score inspired Marin to work hard to learn the language which she accomplished in part by listening to songs on the radio and repeating the words. By 1976, she was in the top 20 out of a class of 500 and graduated with honors.\n\nMarin's family had initially wanted her to forgo any further education and get a job in order to help out the family financially as well as help her mother care for her siblings. Marin compromised by working during the day and attending  at night. After graduating in 1980, she continued to take night classes at the  of the  (CSULA). Marin graduated from CSULA in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science in .Richard Marosi,  ''Los Angeles Times'' May 13, 2001).\n\n\n\n\nMarin originally embarked upon a business and financial career. While attending CSULA, she had obtained work in 1981 at  in  as an assistant receptionist. After several promotions, Marin was poised for elevation to assistant vice president of the bank. However, in 1985 her son Eric was born with  and she quit her job the following year in order to care for him.\"Biography of Treasurer Rosario Marin,\" ''Associated Press'' (March 10, 2003).  She also withdrew from a  program in which she was enrolled.\n\nHer son's condition inspired Marin to become an advocate for the mentally disabled. During this time, she founded the first support group for Latino parents with Down's children as well as Fuerza (\"Force\"), an organization dedicated to providing services and support to mentally disabled children, and lobbied state officials in  on their behalf. It was also during this time, while counseling pregnant women with disabled children, that Marin became a supporter of .\n\nMarin's efforts came to the notice of state officials and, in 1992, she was appointed the chief of Legislative Affairs for the Department of Developmental Services by Governor . At DDS, Marin worked for legislation to benefit the mentally challenged. Two years later, Marin was named chair of the Council on Developmental Disabilities where she continued to advocate for the mentally disabled and their families. For her work on behalf of the mentally disabled, Marin received the \"Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Prize\" by the  in 1995, the second person to receive the award.\n\nFinally, in 1996, Marin was appointed the assistant deputy director for the Department of Social Services.\n\n\nIn addition to her public advocacy work, Marin became politically involved. She had been influenced to join the  (GOP) by her boss at City National after she  in 1984. Additionally, Marin was inspired by what she felt she shared with the ideology of President : \"Personal responsibility. Small government. Strong national defense.\"\n\nIn 1994, while still working in the Wilson Administration, Marin ran for a city council seat in Huntington Park and won. She served seven years on the council, including a term as mayor from 1999 to 2000 – the first Hispanic to hold that post in the city's history.  During her tenure, Marin was known as a law-and-order politician and was credited with various public safety initiatives that reformed the police department, increased its funding, and reduced crime by 50%. She also instituted a task force to combat air pollution in response to a government study that listed Huntington Park as one of several communities particularly at risk and launched a crackdown on a black market for illegal documentation. Despite her political registration, Marin was overwhelmingly re-elected to the council in 1999.\n\nMarin was also known for being a tough and, sometimes, divisive participant of council meetings. Opponents accused her of raucous behavior, while even allies acknowledged a certain arrogance. In 2000, she was censured by the council for being rude toward fellow councilmembers and citizens alike.Richard Marosi,  ''Los Angeles Times'' (December 3, 2003).  Critics also accused her of missing council meetings and misusing her travel budget. Her improbable victory, they point out, was due to \"misrepresenting her true political leanings\" and a \"savvy use of the Spanish media.\"\n\nMarin continued to work for Governor Wilson for the first few years of her time on the council. In 1997, she was named deputy director of the governor's Office of Community Relations in . As the public face of the Administration to , Marin had to deal with the tricky subject of  and other anti-illegal immigration topics which were the subject of heated debate among the community. 187 was particularly unpopular in Huntington Park – a city Marin herself referred to as \"the most Mexican city outside Mexico.\"  While personally opposed to the controversial measure, Marin was called upon by the Administration to defend its position in support.Mark Sherman, \"U.S. treasurer quits, to return to California...\" ''Associated Press'', via ''The Oakland Tribune'' (May 23, 2003).\n\nDuring this time, Marin served as an officer on several commissions such as president of the Mayors and Councils Department of the , vice-chair of the Latino Caucus, and chair of the Southeast Community Development Corporation. She was also a member of various boards such as the California , the , and the  and in 1998 completed the 's program for senior executives in state and local government. In her last two years in office, Marin concurrently worked for  as  for the Hispanic Market in the  Region.Office of the Governor,  (press release), ''GAAS:071:06'' (January 31, 2006) ''Accounting Today'' (September 3, 2001).\n\nMarin continued to bolster her Republican credentials. At the state level, she served as a California delegate to the . She was also a vice-president of the California .California State University- Los Angeles,  ''Today'' (Winter 2002): 4-5.\n\nOn the national scene, Marin was an ardent supporter of George W. Bush's  in 2000. While mayor, she had met the  governor and volunteered in his campaign effort in California working on Hispanic outreach and acting as its Spanish-speaking surrogate.Jeannie Aversa,  ''Associated Press'' (May 22, 2003). Via ''USA Today''.  Her reputation and skill in the community was realized by Republican operatives and Marin's political cachet within the Party increased dramatically. Shortly after his election, Marin was featured prominently among the president-elect's circle.\n\nIn April, 2001, President Bush nominated Marin for the post of U.S. Treasurer. She was confirmed by the  on August 3 and resigned from her city council post three days later.\n\n\n\nMarin was sworn in on August 16, 2001. Treasury Secretary  presided over the ceremony.US Department of the Treasury,   ''History of the Treasury''. Accessed on July 27, 2009.  She became the highest ranking Latina to serve in President Bush's Administration and, as such, was often called upon to represent it before the Hispanic community.\n\nIn addition to the Treasurer's traditional duties of overseeing the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Marin's tenure included organizing the Department’s first financial education outreach efforts. She also served as a member of the new Partnership for Prosperity efforts between the United States and Mexico.  Marin was particularly concerned with educating young people on the importance of building and maintaining financial stability.  She also served as a designee to the  on behalf of Treasury Secretary .\n\nLike previous US Treasurers, Marin continued to make numerous appearances on behalf of the Department, providing it with its public face. On June 15, 2002, she served as the  at the commencement ceremony of her , CSULA, where she received an   degree and continued to garner praise for her achievements.  That same year, she was awarded the \"Groundbreaking Latina of the Year\" award by '''' magazine.\n\nBy April, 2003, speculation began circulating that Marin would soon return to California and become a GOP candidate to challenge US Senator  in the upcoming 2004 electoral cycle. At a speech to Californians in Washington, reporters noted her attacks against the budget of Gov. .\n\nOn May 22, the Treasury Department issued a statement that Marin was resigning her office effective June 30, and was planning to move back to California. Press reports at the time continued to indicate that she would enter the 2004 Senatorial campaign.\n\n\nLater in the year, Marin co-founded the  and served as its first chairwoman.\n\n\n\n\nHoping to ride the popular sentiment that toppled Democratic Gov. Davis in the recall election and installed Republican moderate  in his place, Marin officially became a candidate for the Republican nomination to the US Senate on December 2. In a half-hour speech before a hometown crowd in Huntington Park, Marin painted herself as a moderate while at the same time embracing certain key conservative Republican issues such as national security and low taxes. During the ensuing campaign, she would continue to walk a political tightrope, trying to stress her centrist philosophy while not alienating the party's conservative base.\n\nHighlighting her Republican credentials, Marin evoked rhetoric of Ronald Reagan, proclaimed her support for President Bush's $726&nbsp;billion tax cut, and gave tough speeches about Mexico. At the  in  in February 2004, Marin called for tougher US pressure on Mexico in her first major policy speech of the campaign, including adjusting existing treaties in order to deport criminal aliens.Jean O. Pasco,  ''Los Angeles Times'' (February 6, 2004).  At the same time, she emphasized her own immigrant roots, backed the president's immigrant worker program (which was unpopular with conservatives), and voiced her support for civil unions and abortion rights – the latter of which she tempered with opposition to late-term abortions and support of parental consent laws.Carla Marinucci,  ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (December 3, 2003). During the same month of her Mexico speech, Marin utilized Garry South, former advisor of Gov. Davis, to send out a mailer addressing the Republicans' \"white male problem\" and offering her candidacy as the best chance to defeat Sen. Boxer.\n\nDespite receiving an implied endorsement from the White House as the preferred candidate, Marin was attacked by her fellow Republicans, in particular, former California Secretary of State , the leading candidate for the GOP nod, for her perceived waffling on another hot-button immigration issue: driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. Although she had opposed the state measure granting them signed by Gov. Davis in 2003, she refused to take a position on tough federal legislation to punish states that do so introduced by Congressman  the same year. Marin was also passed over by key Republicans when Governors Schwarzenegger, her old boss Wilson, and  all endorsed Jones.\n\nCritics placed doubt on Marin's ability to raise the estimated $25&nbsp;million she would need with relatively little name recognition. Her refusal to elaborate on key policy statements drew further criticism. Democrats, in the meantime, brought up her contentious terms and censure while serving as a city councilwoman and mayor. Democratic California congresswoman , among others, questioned Marin's claim that she had personally opposed Proposition 187 in 1994 – a problem particularly vexing to the state GOP – saying that she did not do enough to voice that opposition publicly. Marin's attempts at distancing herself from more controversial GOP measures and tacking to the center were dismissed as posturing, and she was labelled by one high-ranking Hispanic Democrat as \"a good house Mexican for the Republicans\".\n\nBy the time of the primary, there were 10 candidates in the GOP race. Despite picking up a substantial number of undecided voters on election day, Marin was unable to overcome GOP frontrunner Jones in name recognition, funding, or popularity among the party. On March 2, she finished second with 20% of the vote compared to Jones' 44%.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing her loss in the race for the US Senate, Governor Schwarzenegger appointed Marin to the Integrated Waste Management Board (IWMB), the state solid waste agency that oversees and regulates recycling. She was sworn in on April 27 and elected chair of the board by her colleagues on September 21.\n\nOn January 31, 2006, the governor appointed Marin as secretary of the  (CSCSA), an agency responsible for civil rights enforcement, consumer protection and the licensing of 2.3&nbsp;million Californians in more than 230 different professions.  On September 7, she received a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" during the League of California Cities 108th Annual Conference.\n\nIn 2007 Rosario published her memoirs, ''Leading Between Two Worlds: Lessons from the First Mexican-Born Treasurer of the United States''. Editorial Santillana published the Spanish version the following year. On May 10, 2008, Marin received an honorary doctorate for her achievements from .\n\nMarin continued to work on behalf of the Republican Party and was a featured speaker at the , addressing the crowd on September 4. The previous day, she joined several other prominent Republican women in denouncing what they considered unfair attacks on vice presidential candidate, Gov.  by the media, bloggers, and the Democratic Party. Marin particularly noted her connection to Palin by virtue of their both having children with Downs.\n\nIn February 2009 Marin was the keynote speaker at the  2008 Sustainability Showcase Awards  where she discussed transforming the market through the implementation of California’s Green Building Initiative.\n\n\nLater that same year, Marin was linked to a secret \"stealth lobbying campaign\" waged by  to influence federal regulation legislation in 2006. According to documents obtained by the '''', the firm had utilized an influential lobbying agency for which she worked, the DCI Group, to target key Republican Senators. The goal of the campaign was to defeat a bill by Sen.  (R-NE) that would have overhauled the mortgage industry, including Freddie Mac and .Pete Yost,   ''Associated Press'' (October 20, 2008). Via ''Foxnews.com''.\n\nIn January, 2006, Marin had given an address in , speaking out against Hagel's Senate Bill 190 claiming that it was too far-reaching and would make it more difficult for people with low-incomes to become homeowners. \"They will no longer be able to do what they have been doing,\" she said referring to the mortgage industry giants.\n\nMarin's office confirmed that her visits to Montana and Missouri at that time were in association with her work for DCI. Sen.  (R-MT) came out against the bill which failed at the end of the 109th session of Congress as did eight of the remaining 16 senators targeted by the campaign.\n\n\nOn March 5, 2009, Marin resigned her position as head of the CSCSA after inquiries by the '''' into speaker's fees she had received and as the paper was preparing to publish a story concerning an ongoing investigation into her activities by the  (CFPPC). A spokesman for Governor Schwarzenegger released a statement that Marin had violated administration policy that prohibits public officials from receiving speaker's fees.Michael Rothfeld,  ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 6, 2009).Michael Rothfeld,  ''Los Angeles Times'' (June 9, 2009).  Marin later fired back stating that \"administration officials knew what she was doing and never advised her to stop.\"\n\nThe ''Times'' story and CFPPC investigation revealed that between April 2004 and the end of 2007, Marin had received in excess of $50,000 for various speaking engagements through the  lecture agency. Additionally, forms filed by a firm established by her and her husband, Marin and Marin, LLC, indicated that she received between $10,000 and $100,000 in speaking fees. The CFPPC was particularly concerned with $15,000 Marin received from the drug company  in 2007 which was simultaneously lobbying the Board of Pharmacy, a regulatory panel under her jurisdiction, and $13,500 from  in 2008 when it was likewise lobbying agencies she oversaw. Marin countered that most of the speeches were \"inspirational\" in nature and that she had kept the  and  informed since her appointment to the IWMB.  The CFPPC had initially launched its investigation after a routine review found that Marin had listed her speaking engagement fees as income.\n\nIn June, Marin settled with the CFPPC, admitting to three ethics violations of state law. Although she was subject to a $15,000 penalty, Marin's fine was reduced to $5,400 after the Commission accepted her position that she had received \"bad legal advice\" from state attorneys and had kept the administration informed. Schwarzenegger's office maintained that they were unaware of her speaking engagement fees.\n\n\nMarin married Alvaro \"Alex\" Marin, an immigrant from , in the early 1980s. Her husband also graduated from CSULA, obtaining a  degree  in 1979. As of 2002, he was working for the city of  as a system analyst. She has two sons and a daughter. One of her sons, Eric, was born with .\n\n\nIn 2003, Marin was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from .\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The bill would require new federal road projects to include plastic conduits buried along the side of the roadway, and enough of them to \"accommodate multiple broadband providers.\" \"According to industry experts, more than half of the cost of new broadband deployment is attributable to the expense of tearing up and repaving roads,\" Eshoo said. \"By putting the broadband conduit in place while the ground beneath the roadways is exposed, we will enable any authorized communications provider to come in later and install fiber-optic cable at far less cost.\" The bill is supported by .\n\nTogether with Rep. , Eshoo introduced the  of 2009, which would make  the law.\n\nEshoo is co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, a bipartisan group of over 150 members of the House and Senate working to educate their colleagues about the promise and potential of the Internet.\n\nEshoo supported the , a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the  (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.

He  as the  from 2003 to 2011.\n\nSchwarzenegger began  at age 15 and won the  title aged 20, and subsequently the  title seven times. He is tied with  for the joint-second number of all-time Mr. Olympia wins, behind  and , who are joint-first with eight wins each. He is widely regarded as one of, if not the greatest,  of all time, and has written many books and articles about it. The , considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him. He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary '''' (1977). After retiring from bodybuilding, he gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the  epic '''' (1982), a box-office success with  in 1984. After playing the  in the science fiction film '''' (1984), he starred in '''' (1991) and three other sequels. His other successful action films included '''' (1985), '''' (1987), '''' (1987), '''' (1990), and '''' (1994), in addition to comedy films such as '''' (1988), '''' (1990) and '''' (1996). He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions.\n\nAs a registered member of the , Schwarzenegger chaired the  during most of the . In 2003, he was elected  in  to replace , the governor at the time. He received 48.6 percent of the vote, 17 points ahead of the runner-up,  of the . He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was reelected in the  with an increased vote share of 55.9 percent to serve a full term. In 2011 he reached his  as governor and returned to acting.\n\nSchwarzenegger was nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" or \"Schwarzy\" during his acting career, and \"the Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"Terminator\") during his political career. He married , a niece of the former U.S. President , in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021.\n\n\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in  on July 30, 1947, the second son of  and his wife Aurelia (née Jadrny; 1922–1998). Gustav was the local chief of police, and after the  in 1938 joined the  and in 1939 the  (SA). In , Gustav served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the , rising to the title of ''''. He was wounded in the , and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of . According to Holocaust scholar , Gustav Schwarzenegger served \"in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role.\" Gustav's background received wide press attention during the  in which Schwarzenegger was elected.\n\nGustav married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\" He grew up in a Catholic family. Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold. His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. Schwarzenegger says that his earliest childhood memory is of climbing into his parents' bed during a bad thunder-and-lightning storm and cuddling between his mother and father. He has said, however, that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems\". He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death.\n\nIn an interview with '''' in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what \"would now be called \" at the hands of his father: \"My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.\n\nAt school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average but stood out for his \"cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant\" character. He struggled with reading and was later diagnosed as being . Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator. His father Gustav was an athlete, and wished for his sons to become champions in . Influenced by his father, Schwarzenegger played several sports as a boy.\n\nSchwarzenegger began  in 1960 when his  coach took his team to a local gym. At age 14, he chose  over football as a career. He later said, \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start .\" However, his official website biography claims that \"at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\"\n\n\nSchwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in , where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see films with bodybuilding idols such as ,  and . When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends to train even when it was closed. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When asked about his first cinema experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some . The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a  movie.\" In Graz, he was mentored by Alfred Gerstl, who had Jewish ancestry and later became , and befriended his son Karl.\n\nSchwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971. He was  and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named . Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S. Schwarzenegger's father, Gustav, died of a stroke on December 13, 1972. In '''', Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film. However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.\n\nSchwarzenegger served in the  in 1965 to fulfill the  at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males. During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest. He went  during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: \"Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.\" He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted \"best-built man of Europe\", which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. \"The  title was my ticket to Americathe land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.\" Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the  competition in London. He placed second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner .\n\nCharles \"Wag\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in , London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving his. Staying in the  helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary English. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: \"Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.\"\n\nAlso in 1966, at Bennett's home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol , who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at age 20. He would go on to win the title another three times. He then returned to , where he attended business school and worked at Rolf Putziger's gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968 before returning to London in 1968 to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told , his English coach and friend in Munich at the time, \"I'm going to become the greatest actor!\"\n\nSchwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the US since age ten, and saw bodybuilding as his avenue of opportunity, realized his dream by moving to the US in October 1968 at age 21, speaking little English. There he trained at  in , California, under 's supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was , a  who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973. Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler . In 1970, at age 23, Schwarzenegger captured his first  title in New York, and would go on to win the title seven times.\n\nThe immigration law firm Siskind & Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an  at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his . '''' said in 2002 that Schwarzenegger was \"the most famous US immigrant\", who \"overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s\".\n\nIn 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography and weight-training guide, ''Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder,'' was a huge success. In 1977, he posed for the gay magazine ''''. After taking an assortment of courses at  in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the  as part of UCLA's extension program, he accumulated enough credits to be \"within striking distance\" of graduation. In 1979, he enrolled in the  as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and earned his  in business administration and marketing. He received his  in 1983. He received an  from  in 2023.\n\n\nSchwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the  annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.\n\nFor many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines '''' and ''''. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1&nbsp;million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a  since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of s in California.Megerian, Chris. (March 1, 2013). .  ''Los Angeles Times''. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005. American Media Inc., which owns ''Muscle & Fitness'' and ''Flex'', announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.\n\nOne of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19. He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4&nbsp;–  [England], 1&nbsp;–  [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until  won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.\n\nSchwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011  he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.\n\n\nDuring Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several  and  contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963 and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.\n\nIn 1967, Schwarzenegger won the  stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254&nbsp;kg / 560&nbsp;lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.\n\n\n*  – \n*  – \n*  – \n*  – \n*  – \n*  – \n\n\n\nSchwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming . His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion . However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.\n\nHe continued his winning streak in the 1971–1974 competitions. He also toured different countries selling s, as in , Finland in 1972, when he lived at the  Hotel Hospiz (nowadays Hotel Arthur) on Vuorikatu and presented vitamin pills at the . In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time, beating . After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.\n\nMonths before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete and film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''''. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film '''' with . Although significantly taller and heavier,  proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.\n\nSchwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger was training for his role in '''', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide  for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: \"It was very difficult for me in the beginning&nbsp;– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the  film '''' (1977), elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography. In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the  sitcom '''' and the ABC  ''''.

He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the , accompanying then–Vice President  at a campaign rally.\n\nSchwarzenegger famously introduced the first episode of the 1990  hosted  series '''' stating:\n\n}} Schwarzenegger goes on to tell of how he and his then wife Maria Shriver were in  preparing to play a game of  when Milton Friedman's famous show came on the television. Schwarzenegger recalls that while watching Friedman's ''Free to Choose'', Schwarzenegger, \"...recognized Friedman from the study of my own degree in economics, but I didn't know I was watching Free to Choose... it knocked me out. Dr. Friedman expressed, validated and explained everything I ever thought or experienced or observed about the way the economy works, and I guess I was really ready to hear it.\" Numerous critics state that Schwarzenegger strayed from much of Friedman's economic ways of thinking in later years, especially upon being elected Governor of California from 2003 through 2011.\n\nSchwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the , on which he served from 1990 to 1993.

Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSchwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the  for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of ''''. Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the \"Governator\" (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and \"\" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election \"\" (another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.\n\n meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship.]]\nOn October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor  being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat , fellow Republican , and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3&nbsp;million votes.

He has supported gay rights, such as domestic partnerships, and he performed a same-sex marriage as governor. However, Schwarzenegger vetoed bills that would have legalized  in California in 2005 and 2007. He additionally vetoed two bills that would have implemented a  system in California in 2006 and 2008, respectively.\n\nSchwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up . Building on a catchphrase from the sketch \"\" from '''' (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians \"\".\n\nSchwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a  he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He later commented that \"no one could win if the opposition raised 160&nbsp;million dollars to defeat you\". The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in ''''.\n\n and  CEO ]]\nSchwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff.

Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes. Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006  breakfast, in which Schwarzenegger said, in part \"How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America ... the state of California does not provide [equal] education for all of our children\", San Francisco mayor and future governor of California  said: \"He's becoming a Democrat ... He's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left.\"\n\nSome speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the  in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false.\n\n behind him, President  comments on  in California, October 2007.]]\nWendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, \"I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential&nbsp;– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.\" Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, \"I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and  became my heroes.\" Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of , and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.\n\nSchwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. president as he is not a . Schwarzenegger is a  Austrian and United States citizen. He has held  since birth and  since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007  campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California  and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.\n\n in San Diego, July 2010]]\nBecause of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.\n\nSchwarzenegger's endorsement in the  of the  was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates  and Senator , Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the  in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, \"It's Rudy's fault!\" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.\n\nIn its April 2010 report,  ethics watchdog group  named Schwarzenegger one of 11 \"worst governors\" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.\n\nGovernor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing , a proposed amendment of the Californian , in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intense campaign against Proposition 66. He stated that \"it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists\".\n\nAlthough he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 65% in May 2004), he left office with a near-record low 23%, only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, his predecessor, when he was recalled in October 2003.\n\n\n\nIn May 2010, Esteban Núñez pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the . Núñez is the son of , then  Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.\n\nAs a personal favor to \"a friend\", just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger  Núñez's sentence by more than half, to seven years. He believed that Núñez's sentence was \"excessive\" in comparison with the same prison term imposed on Ryan Jett, the man who fatally stabbed Santos. Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos' family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.\n\nThe Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated . In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, \"Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion... This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.\" However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor. Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor  signed a bipartisan bill that allows offenders' victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days before any commutations. Núñez was released from prison after serving less than six years.\n\n\n protesting against Schwarzenegger]]\nDuring his , allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger. Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the '''' recounting decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct from six individual women. Schwarzenegger responded to the allegations in 2004 admitting that he has \"behaved badly sometimes\" and apologized, but also stated that \"a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true\". One of the women who came forward was British television personality , who settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger; his top aide, Sean Walsh; and his publicist, Sheryl Main. A joint statement read: \"The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.\" In 2023, Schwarzenegger revisited the issue while promoting his new three-part biographical documentary on Netflix called ''''.

In an interview with '''' magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, \"[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.\" His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.\n\n\n\nSchwarzenegger became a  on September 17, 1983. Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his , as Austria does not usually allow .

The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.\n\nSchwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's .

As a result of his early business and investment success, Schwarzenegger became a millionaire by the age of 25, well before making a name for himself in Hollywood. His path to financial independence came as a result of his success as a proactive businessman and investor involved with a series of lucrative business ventures and real estate investments.\n\n\nIn 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder  started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the .

In 1998, he sold his restaurant.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, '''' estimated that Schwarzenegger was a billionaire.\n\nIn June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38&nbsp;million on a private Gulfstream jet.\n\nRegarding his private fortune, Schwarzenegger once quipped: \"Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50&nbsp;million, but I was just as happy when I had $48&nbsp;million.\"\n\nIn 2003, Schwarzenegger's net worth was conservatively estimated at $100&nbsp;million to $200&nbsp;million.\n\nAfter separating from his wife, , in 2011, it was estimated that his net worth had been approximately $400&nbsp;million, and even as high as $800&nbsp;million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.\n\n\nSchwarzenegger has also appeared in a series of commercials for the  game ''Mobile Strike'' as a military commander and spokesman.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the  on television. They shared an apartment in , for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had \"little understanding of polite society\" and she found him a turn-off, she says, \"He's as much a  as it's possible to behe never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.\" Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, \"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\" Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a \"joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\" but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became \"insufferableclassically conceitedthe world revolved around him\". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled ''Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak''. Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the  book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.\n\nSchwarzenegger met his next lover,  hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on  in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an : \"We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President , at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978 when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.\n\n\n at the 2007  in Shanghai]]\nOn April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in . They have four children:  (* 1989), Christina (* 1991),  (* 1993) and Christopher (* 1997). All of their children were born in Los Angeles.

They attended .\n\n\n at  in December 2002]]\n\nOn May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage with Shriver moving out of their Brentwood mansion.\n\nPursuant to the divorce judgment, Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home, while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents' homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children. Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney's fees. However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them. He filed amended divorce papers remedying this. Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2021, ten years after separating.\n\nIn June 2022, a jury ruled that Maria Shriver was entitled to half of her ex-husband's post-divorce savings that he earned from 1986 to 2011, including a pension.\n\nOn May 16, 2011, the '''' revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son, , more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia \"Patty\" Baena. \"After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,\" Schwarzenegger said to the ''Times''. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child. \nBaena is of  origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011. The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children. Baena's son with Schwarzenegger was born five days after Shriver gave birth. Schwarzenegger said that it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy \"started looking like [him] ... that [he] put things together\". Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child \"from the start and continued to provide support\".  radio reported that, in 2010, he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in . Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, a few months after 's birth. She filed for divorce in 2008. Rogelio said that the child's birth certificate was falsified and that he planned to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.\n\nWhen asked in January 2014, \"Of all the things you are famous for ... which are you least proud of?\" Schwarzenegger replied, \"I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up.\"\n\n\n\n\nSchwarzenegger was born with a , an aortic valve with only two leaflets, where a normal aortic valve has three. He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made from his own , which itself was replaced with a cadaveric pulmonic valve, in a ; medical experts predicted he would require pulmonic heart valve replacement surgery within the next two to eight years because his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.\n\nOn March 29, 2018, Schwarzenegger underwent emergency open-heart surgery for replacement of his replacement pulmonic valve. He said about his recovery: \"I underwent open-heart surgery this spring, I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry, and in my worst moments, I couldn't see the way back to my old self.\"\n\nIn 2020, 23 years after his first surgery, Schwarzenegger underwent a surgery for a new aortic valve.\n\n\nOn December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.\n\nSchwarzenegger saved a drowning man in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.\n\nOn January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his  motorcycle in Los Angeles with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained an injury to his lip requiring 15 stitches. \"No citations were issued,\" said Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.\n\nSchwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right  while skiing in , with his family on December 23, 2006.

He was released from  on December 30, 2006.\n\nSchwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at  on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.\n\nOn May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked and ed from behind by an unknown malefactor while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools.

Bloomsbury, 2003 Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the ''''. As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman  over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, \"settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is\" by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words \"Need a lift?\" on the  Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office. Democrat  also claimed Schwarzenegger was  and that he wore risers in his boots. In 1999, '''' magazine stated his height was .\n\n\nSchwarzenegger's autobiography, ''Total Recall'', was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called \"The Secret\" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California. Schwarzenegger released a second book in 2023 titled ''Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life'', which features life advice and again touches on his life experiences.\n\n\nGrowing up during , Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child. As a result, he paid $20,000 to bring his Austrian Army  tank (331) to the United States, which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965. However, he later obtained his vehicle in 1991/2, during his tenure as the Chairmen of the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and now uses it to support his charity.

During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the  Network, and gained a  grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.

Due to recent amendments to the cities' charter he is the first directly elected mayor with a four year term, as the mayoral role was traditionally a one year term selected by other council members.  Keeley was a member of the , representing District 27 which included parts of  and  from 1996 to 2002. He retired in January 2015 after 10 years as the Treasurer of Santa Cruz County.\n\n\nKeeley was born in . He is the second son of Harry and Elizabeth Keeley. He was raised in . He attended and graduated from  in 1969. He attended  in the early 1970s and took film classes from Professor Robert Scott. In 1974, Keeley graduated with honors from , School of Social Sciences.\n\nAfter working for Law Enforcement Training and Research Associates, he was selected by Santa Cruz County Supervisor Joe Cucchaira to be Cucchaira's policy director. Keeley served in that capacity until March 1984 when then-Assembly Member  (D-Carmel) hired Keeley to be his chief of staff. Keeley served in that capacity for nearly five years.\n\nKeeley served for eight years as a member of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, prior to his election to the California Assembly.\n\n\n\n\nModerate Republican 's decision to run for  District 15 made California Assembly District 27 an open seat. In March 1996, Keeley ran for the  nomination for the 27th Assembly District against Karin Kauffman. Keeley won over 55% of the party's Democratic voters, and 33% of all votes cast. In the November general election, Keeley won about 57% of all votes cast against Republican Jim Davis.\n\n\nDuring his first term in the Assembly, Keeley chaired the Budget Subcommittee on Resources, where he advanced legislation, known as the Marine Life Management Act of 1998.\n\nAlso in 1998, Keeley was selected by Assembly Speaker  to be Speaker pro Tempore.  This is the highest-ranking member of the Speaker's leadership team and, as such, Keeley was responsible for the development of the majority party's important policy initiatives. Keeley also investigated the actions of then-Insurance Commissioner . As a result of the investigation, Quackenbush resigned his office.\n\nDuring this time, Keeley also authored the two largest park and environmental protection bonds in the nation's history, Proposition 12 on the California ballot in March 2000, and  on the California ballot in March 2002. Together, these voter-approved bonds provided $4.7 billion for environmental protection, park land and other valuable habitat land acquisition throughout the nation's most populated state.\n\n\nIn late 2000 and early 2001, the  manifested itself with s in many parts of the state. Speaker  appointed Keeley, his Speaker pro Tempore, as \"chief operating officer\" for the Assembly on the energy crisis. This position had three primary duties: to establish a triage system for dealing with day-to-day, minute-to-minute emergencies that were direct outgrowths of the lack of electricity; to form a policy group, both at the staff and legislator level, to sort out those ideas that were being advanced to solve the problem, and make recommendations to the Speaker and the governor, on how to tackle the many fronts on which this crisis was expanding; and to be the author of the agreed-upon package of legislation that would try to tame the energy crisis monster.\n\nDuring the energy crisis, a variety of options were under consideration. The State of California was trying to get the  to cap the wholesale price of electricity, as that price was far exceeding the statutory limit that regulated utilities in California could charge their retail customers. The wholesale price was far in excess of the retail price because of deregulation. When the legislature deregulated the electricity sector in 1996, it did so by taking a number of statutory actions.  One was to create a Power Exchange or PX. This was intended to be the trading floor for buyers and sellers of electricity.  Keeley believed that the model was seriously flawed because it assumed that electricity could be treated as a commodity. Commodities markets have several features: Many buyers, many sellers, transparent transactions, substitute products, and the ability of the buyer to withhold buying if the price is not to his or her liking. According to Keeley, the PX had none of these features.\n\nIn order to stabilize prices, and to assure a reliable supply of electricity, Keeley became the author of the State of California's solution so California participate in the market by buying the so-called net short position each day, and to sell that electricity to utility customers.  While there was much criticism of the strategy at the time, it is clear that it had the desired effect: to wit, it stabilized prices and assured supply. PG&E's solution included the transfer of watershed lands and the creation of a youth stewardship program.\n\nAfter the energy crisis, the California faced a massive budget deficit. Keeley helped in the budget negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to get the necessary 2/3 vote to pass the state budget compromise on the state budget.\n\n\n\n\nDue to term limits, Keeley left the Assembly in December 2002. Then-Governor  asked Keeley to join his cabinet as Director of the . Keeley declined, and instead became Executive Director of the  and the . These two non-profit organizations specialize in environmental research and legislative advocacy. Keeley led these two organizations for two years.\n\n\nWhen Keeley was termed out of the legislature, the  established a perpetual environmental lecture series in his honor, known as the Fred Keeley Lectures on the Environment. The initial lecture was given by former Arizona Governor and  . In 2005, the lecture was given by Dr.  of Stanford University, and author of the best selling book ''The Population Bomb''. Keeley also made a planned gift of $250,000 to UCSC to support the campus's STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research.\n\nSince Fall 2006, Keeley has taught courses as a part-time faculty member in the Department of Political Science at . He has taught State Politics and Legislative Politics, and is scheduled to teach Local Politics in Fall 2007. Keeley is a frequent lecturer on California state government, politics, and a variety of environmental topics at Stanford University, the University of California at Santa Cruz, Duke University, San Jose State University, , the , and the .

Thao fired Armstrong on February 15, 2023, and indicated she had lost confidence in his ability to reform the police department. Armstrong filed a wrongful terminational lawsuit against the city of Oakland and Thao. In March 2024, Thao appointed  as the new police chief.\n\nThao's administration faced criticism from community leaders after missing a deadline to apply for the Organized Retail Theft Prevention (ORTP) Grant Program. The grant awards cities millions of dollars to fight retail crime through allocating funds \"to hire more officers, create task forces and develop investigative units.\" An audit released in May 2024 conducted by the acting City Auditor of Oakland found that, \"there was poor communication, within departments and between departments, there was no project management and no one really took charge.\" The City of Oakland prepared, but \"did not successfully submit an application for the ORTP (Organized Retail Theft Prevention) grant.\"\n\nIn September 2023, Thao announced $2.5 million in more funding for the  system. In her  address on October 17, 2023, Thao discussed crime and public safety, including efforts to improve the 911 system, obtain new  officers, and hire a person responsible for applying to grants.\n\nThe Oakland Police Department statistics for 2024 show \"33 percent fewer violent crimes overall this year compared to last year.\" Robberies rose 11% and residential robberies rose 118%.\n\nIn July 2024, , the Governor of California, urged Oakland to allow more police pursuits. Currently, Oakland only allows police pursuits when a suspect is armed with a gun or involved in a forcible violent crime, a policy that has been in place since 2014.

Other businesses,  and , have shut down dining rooms to reduce the risk of crime. , , and  have increased security and warned employees about crime in the area. In a statement to , Thao claimed to prioritize public safety and said \"that she added police presence and employed technology 'to deter and respond to criminal behavior.'\" Thao's office provided statistics that show a decline in some areas of crime in the Hegenberger Road corridor where  was located.\n\n\nFor several months, Thao's administration continued negotiations with the owners of the  for the team to stay in Oakland, which had begun during the administration of Thao's predecessor, Libby Schaaf. In April 2023, the team president announced an agreement to buy land for a stadium in Las Vegas. On April 20, Thao indicated she was open to continuing negotiations despite the announcement by the team. In July 2023, Thao and other Oakland officials met with MLB   and Deputy Commissioner Dan Halem to discuss the proposal for the A's to stay in Oakland. John Fisher, owner of the Oakland Athletics, rejected the City of Oakland’s \"offer for a five-year, $97 million lease extension on the Coliseum\" and a revised, \"final three-year, $60 million lease,\" ultimately relocating the team to Las Vegas.\n\nThao announced on May 22, 2024 that the City of Oakland would sell its share of the  (the former home of the Oakland A's) to the African American Sports & Entertainment Group (AASEG) for $105 million. The money from the sale was expected to \"help fill shortfalls in the city's budget\" and city officials said the sale would pave \"the way for a proposed sports and entertainment destination site, thousands of new affordable housing units, and community benefits for historically neglected East Oakland.\" The deal has thus far not been completed.\n\nIn May 2023, Thao proposed a two-year $4.2 billion budget with city department mergers and hiring freezes proposed to help account for a $360 million budget deficit. A $4.2 billion budget was passed by the city council in June 2023 to address the deficit with some department mergers, hiring freezes to prevent layoffs, and spending cuts.\n\nIn 2024, Oakland faced a $117 million . Thao and Oakland's city council approved budget changes that \"will avoid drastic cuts but also rely on the still-pending sale of the city’s most valuable real estate property.\" The pending sale of the  is \"estimated to bring in $105 million.\" Financial analysts warned city officials against relying on sales of assets to \"remedy short-term budget shortfalls.\" \n\n\nA group called Oakland United to Recall Sheng Thao (OUST) organized to recall her from office and submitted a petition on June 5, 2024. On June 18, 2024, the Alameda County Registrar of Voters received around 40,000  signatures. A random sample projected that roughly 26% of the petitions, or somewhere around 10,753 signatures, were not “valid signatures of qualified registered voters” in the city. Alameda County’s elections office estimated that the whole batch would exceed 110% of the necessary threshold, or enough to trigger a recall election outright without a full manual count of signatures. The recall will be the first mayor recall election in Oakland's history.\n\nA small group of protestors rallied outside of Oakland City Hall calling for Mayor Thao to address a  celebration mass shooting at  that wounded 15 people and the FBI raid at her home. The group supports the recall election and demanded Thao's resignation. The  is scheduled to coincide with the presidential election.\n\n\nThe , along with agents from the  and , raided Thao's home on June 20, 2024. Three other residences and properties belonging to the owners of Cal Waste Solutions, the Duong family, were also raided on the same day. Following the raid, the Oakland chapter of the NAACP called on Sheng Thao to resign. On July 8, 2024, the U.S. Attorney’s Office ordered the city of Oakland to hand over documents and records. Among the requested records in the subpoena are \"communications related to Andre Jones and all calendar entries or records of the existence of planned or scheduled meeting with Thao or Jones from June 2022 to the present.\" On July 10, 2024, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California issued a new subpoena that \"appear to be after police reports related to the Duong family, the owners of the city’s recycling contractor\".\n\n\nAs of 2024, Sheng Thao was living with her partner, Andre Jones, and their two children in a 4-bedroom home on Maiden Lane in Oakland's Lincoln Highlands neighborhood. She met Jones, at the time Kaplan's chief of staff, during her internship with Oakland city Councilmember .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He is a member of the .\n\nHis district included much of the western part of the city of , as well as , , and , and was numbered the  from 1975 to 1993, the  from 1993 to 2003, and the  from 2003 to 2013, changing because of  after the , , and  censuses.\n\nWaxman was an influential  member of , and was instrumental in passing laws including the , the , the  of 1984, the  of 1990, the  of 1990, the  of 1996, the  of 1997, the  of 2006, the  of 2009, and the  of 2010. In 1985, he played an instrumental role in banning federal funding for the  subway in Los Angeles so that it would not go into his affluent Westside district.\n\nHe is currently chairman at Waxman Strategies, a D.C.-based lobbying firm, Regent Lecturer for University of California, Los Angeles, and lecturer at the .\n\n\nWaxman was born to a Jewish household in , , the son of Esther (née Silverman) and Ralph Louis Waxman. His father was born in Montreal, Canada; his mother was from Pennsylvania. All of his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from . He attended college at , earning a  in  in 1961 and a  degree from  in 1964. After graduating, he worked as a lawyer. He was elected to the  in 1968, and served three terms. Along with U.S. Representative , whom he studied with at UCLA, Waxman co-founded the .\n\n\n\nIn 1974, Democratic U.S. Representative  retired after 16 terms in Congress. Waxman gave up his state assembly seat to run for the district, which had been re-numbered from the 19th to the 24th in a mid-decade redistricting. Waxman won the Democratic nomination for the district, and easily won the general election, as this was  in this heavily Democratic district. He was re-elected 17 times, with no substantive opposition. He faced no major-party opposition in 1986, and was completely unopposed in 2008. His district changed numbers four times in his tenure  from the 24th (1975–1993) to the 29th (1993–2003) to the 30th (2003–2013) to the 33rd (2013-2015). At the time of his retirement, he was one of the last two members, along with  of California, of the large Democratic freshman class of 1975.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, Waxman's district included , , , , , , , and , as well as such areas of western Los Angeles as , , , , , , , , , , , , but through the creation of a new 33rd Congressional District by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, in the November 2012 general election, Waxman won re-election in an area including his home community of Beverly Hills and stretching to Malibu and Pacific-coastal communities heading south, including Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, the Palos Verdes Peninsula, and Northwest San Pedro.\n\n\nBefore the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 1995, Waxman was a powerful figure in the House as chair of the  from 1979. In this role, he conducted investigations into a range of health and environmental issues, including universal health insurance,  and  coverage, , and air and water pollution. In 1994, Waxman forced the chief executives of the seven major tobacco companies to swear under oath that  was not addictive.\n\nWaxman's stated legislative priorities are health and environmental issues. These include universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, tobacco, AIDS, air and water quality standards, pesticides, nursing home quality standards, women's health research and reproductive rights, the availability and cost of prescription drugs, and the right of communities to know about pollution levels. As an example of Waxman's thoughts regarding tobacco, on April 13, 2010, he requested that  ban smokeless tobacco in all its various forms - , , , , etc.\n\n\n\nWith the Democrats' victory in the , Waxman became chairman of the , the principal investigative committee of the House. He was the committee's ranking Democrat from 1997 to 2007. In 1998, while he was still ranking member, he created a \"Special Investigations Division\" to investigate matters that he felt the full committee had neglected. This was possible because the committee has broad powers to investigate any matter with federal policy implications, even if another committee has jurisdiction over it. He has also harshly criticized the Republicans for ignoring their \"constitutional responsibility\" to conduct oversight over the government.\n\nOn March 16, 2004, at Waxman's request, the Committee on Government Reform Minority Office published \"Iraq on the Record, the Bush Administration's Public Statements on Iraq\", a detailed and searchable collection of 237 specific misleading statements made by Bush Administration officials about the threat posed by Iraq. It contains statements that were misleading based on what was known to the Administration at the time the statements were made. It does not include statements that appear mistaken only in hindsight. If a statement was an accurate reflection of U.S. intelligence at the time it was made, it was excluded even if it now appears erroneous.\n\nIn 2006, Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Waxman with its Good Government Award for his various contributions to government transparency and oversight.\n\nOn the day after the 2006 elections, Waxman directed his aides to draw up an \"oversight plan\" for the panel. He had already let it be known that he wanted to investigate , as well as its alleged malfeasance related to government contracts in . It is very likely that he could also investigate the numerous scandals surrounding . This led to concerns among Democratic aides that the Government Reform Committee under Waxman would stage a repeat of the committee's performance under the , when it issued over 1,000 subpoenas. However, Waxman told '''' that he is interested in accountability and not retaliation.\n\nIn 2009, he began serving as the Chairman of the , after defeating Chairman  in a 137–122 secret vote of House Democrats on November 20, 2008.\n\n\n\nSenator  of Wyoming once described Waxman as being 'tougher than a boiled owl.'\n\nWaxman is proud of his \"strong Jewish identity\" and has drawn political conclusions from his exploration of the religion. \"Judaism is about acting and doing the right thing, not simply believing in it or mindlessly following ritual,\" he said in a speech presented by the 's Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life. Waxman said he applies Jewish ethical values to his congressional service. He further said that the \"Jewish values\" of \"human rights, social justice, and equal opportunities ... are synonymous with American values,\" and that such values \"are in my opinion closer to a Democratic position.\" Waxman supported fellow representative  during her primary challenge from Marcy Winograd when Winograd said she would support a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, instead of the two-state resolution endorsed by Waxman and Harman. Saying it suffers from \"a culture of corruption\" and \"has become obsessed with secrecy,\" he accused the  of having abandoned these values. \"(The) Republican leadership ignores presidential rules and norms and has no consideration for custom,\" he said.\n\n\nWaxman was strongly critical of the , which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 . Instead of this version, it was reported that many Democrats supported a version that would find \"common ground.\"\n\n\nIn 1985, Waxman sponsored a bill supported by affluent  in his district to ban federal funding for the  subway after a  explosion in the . Prior to that, Waxman had privately expressed concerns about \"gentrification\" of his affluent district.\n\nWaxman maintains that the 1985 bill was sponsored in the interest of public safety and not, as some allege, to hinder access of the working classes in  and  to his affluent district. In a letter to the '''', Waxman cites the 2005 study: \"The panel concurred as well that in 1985, the decision to hold further tunneling in abeyance was prudent, given the circumstances and extent of information and technology at that time. Much has changed since then to significantly improve tunneling and operation safety.\"\n\nIn 2005, a robust  market, multi-dwelling construction boom, and lack of public mass transit planning on the westside caused by Waxman's bill resulted in gridlock throughout Waxman's district. At the request of Los Angeles Mayor and  Board President , Waxman agreed to lift the ban if a panel of five engineers found tunneling under the  stretch of Wilshire Boulevard to be safe. In October 2005, the panel decided that tunneling was possible, and on December 16, Waxman responded by announcing he would introduce a bill to the U.S. House that would lift the ban on federal money for subway tunneling in the district. This bill passed the House via unanimous vote on September 20, 2006.\n\n\nWaxman, as the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, oversaw the case of , a solar company that filed for bankruptcy after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the DOE. Waxman recounted meeting with Solyndra's CEO two months before they filed for bankruptcy, who assured him that \"Solyndra’s future was bright with sales and production booming.\" Waxman was accused of being involved with the Solyndra loan by . Waxman responded, saying he had no involvement in the selection of the loan.\n\n\n* '''''' (Ranking Member)\n** As ranking member of the full committee, Rep.

In discussing the concept of political \"work horses\", as compared to \"show horses\", Maher described Waxman's legislative achievements and emphasized that Waxman's tenacity and low public profile as a \"work horse\" allowed him to effect substantial change in the United States, specifically through updates to programs and policies including food safety, clean air, HIV research, and the social safety net.

He was raised and educated in Oklahoma, and graduated from 's . During the summers of his high school years, Condit worked as a  in Oklahoma's oil fields. In 1967, at age 18, he married his high school sweetheart Carolyn Berry. An investigation by journalists in 2001 revealed that Condit provided the wrong birth date for his marriage license. At the time, Oklahoma required males under age 21 to have parental consent to marry; by claiming to have been born in 1942 rather than 1948, Condit appeared to be older than 18.\n\nIn 1967, Condit's father became pastor of a  church in , near , causing his family to relocate there.

Condit kept his seat on the Intelligence Committee, retained his security clearance, and was one of a small number of members of Congress who were cleared to see the most sensitive information on the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn December 7, 2001, Condit announced he would run for re-election. He lost the Democratic primary election in March 2002 to his former aide, then- , and left Congress at the end of his term in January 2003. Condit's most notable vote in his last months in office was the resolution to expel Congressman  after his conviction on corruption charges. In the 420–1 vote on July 24, 2002, Condit was the sole \"nay\".\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Condit became the subject of national news coverage after the disappearance of Chandra Levy, a young woman working as a  intern, originally from Condit's district. Police questioned Condit twice, and both times he denied having an extramarital affair with her; however, Levy's aunt eventually went public with conversations she had with her about their relationship. Police questioned Condit a third time, and he confessed to the affair. Undated article published in July 2001. CNN News. Accessed December 19, 2006.  July 7, 2001. CNN News. Accessed December 19, 2006. When the affair began, Condit was 53 and Levy was 23.\n\nWhile Condit was not named as an official suspect in the disappearance, Levy's family suspected that he was withholding important information. His reputation suffered from the contrast between his \"pro-family\" politics, his adultery with a woman younger than his daughter, and his attempts to mislead the police regarding his affair. In July, two months after Levy vanished, Condit agreed to let investigators search his apartment; hours before the search, police said he was spotted throwing a gift box he had received from another woman into a dumpster in a Washington suburb. This followed news reports that Condit had had an affair with a flight attendant.\n\nLevy's remains were not found during the extensive search that followed her disappearance, but were discovered accidentally May 22, 2002, in a secluded area of  in Washington D.C.; the death was declared a .\n\nIn late 2002, Condit sued writer  of '''' for $11 million, claiming that Dunne  him by suggesting he ordered Levy killed in 2001.

Condit's attorney said that Dunne's comments \"conveyed that Gary Condit was involved in her kidnapping and in her murder, that friends of Gary Condit had her kidnapped, put in an airplane and dropped in the Atlantic Ocean.\" Dunne paid an undisclosed amount to settle that lawsuit in March 2005. Dunne said he had been \"completely hoodwinked\" by an unreliable informant. Subsequently, Condit sued Dunne again, charging him with \"revivifying\" the slander in an appearance on 's '''' in November 2005. In July 2008 a federal judge dismissed the second lawsuit filed against Dunne.\n\nIn July 2006, Condit sued the '''', a free weekly newspaper, for defamation of character after the publication wrote \"that Condit was the 'main focus in the Chandra Levy case in 2001, after lying to investigators about his affair with Levy.'\"Doyle, Michael.  , '''', 26 July 2006.

He was subsequently indicted for Levy's murder. On November 22, 2010, Guandique was found guilty of first-degree murder, and was sentenced in February 2011 to 60 years in prison. BBC News US & Canada, February 11, 2011 Condit's lawyer Bert Fields said, \"It's a complete vindication but that comes a little late. Who gives him his career back?\"\n\nHowever, on June 4, 2015,  Judge  granted a motion for the retrial of Guandique after it was revealed that the sole witness against him, a jailhouse informant named Armando Morales, had lied about prior jailhouse testimony.   from : June 4, 2015.

Levy's death therefore remains unsolved.\n\n\nAfter his departure from office, Condit moved to  and operated two  ice cream stores with his wife and son. When the franchise failed, Condit was ordered to pay the company $98,000 in a  proceeding. In 2012, he was reported to be serving as president of the Phoenix Institute of Desert Agriculture, which listed its status as 'Dissolved' in the last corporate filing as of June 4, 2015.

During sentencing, Federal District Judge Charles Beyer called Yee's actions \"vile\" and the arms dealings particularly \"hypocritical\" given the politician's history of gun control. In 2006 Yee was named to the Gun Violence Prevention Honor Roll by the  for his efforts that included co-authoring a first-in-the-nation bill to require new semiautomatic handguns be equipped with ballistics identification technology known as .Staff Writers. , '''', March 26, 2014. In May 2012, together with , Yee proposed legislation to ban any semi-automatic rifle that used a  that makes the rifle a \"fixed magazine rifle.\"  would ban conversion kits and rifles. According to his press release, \"Absent this bill, California's assault weapon ban is significantly weakened. For the safety of the general public, we must close this loophole.\" Yee is quoted as saying, \"It is extremely important that individuals in the state of California do not own assault weapons. I mean that is just so crystal clear, there is no debate, no discussion.\"\n\n\nYee had 11 bills signed into law in 2007. Included in these bills was SB 279, making it unlawful to park cars for sale, deemed a public nuisance and traffic hazard, along public roads, SB 190, which brings more transparency to the compensation practices of administrators at the University of California and the California State University, SB 523, which increases the quantity of child support payments collected in San Mateo County, and SCR 52, which declares the legislature \"finds that joint governance of the University of California Retirement Plan is necessary to ensure that significant pension plan decisions are based on full and accurate information, to prevent conflicts of interest from impacting the management and performance of the University of California Retirement Plan, and to ensure that the University of California Retirement Plan is financially sound and well managed in a fair and appropriate manner.\"\n\nOn April 12, 2007, Yee criticized the United States Army's plan to spend $2 million in tax dollars to sponsor the Global Gaming League. Yee claims the military individuals on the site are \"desensitized to real-life violence through the online violent video games.\"\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Yee again criticized the ESRB, this time for not disclosing what content was removed from '''' to re-rate the game from an AO rating for violence to the ESRB Mature rating. Yee asked the  to investigate the change in rating. In response, ESRB president  stated the details for a product that has not yet been released will not be disclosed.\n\n\nYee had fourteen bills signed into law in 2008. Among these bills, SB 697 prohibits balance billing of patients in the California's Healthy Families program, SB 1217 allows public oversight of the state bar pilots commission, SB 1356, which aims to protect victims of domestic violence from the threat of jail when they refrain from testifying against their abuser in court, SB 1370, which protects teachers from the retaliatory action of school officials as a result of student speech, SB 1696, which states that contracts between a government and a private entity should be subject to the same disclosure requirements as other public records, and SB 1419, which creates a double-fine zone on 19th and Van Ness Avenuesan area with a historically high pedestrian collision rate.\n\nYee and Assemblyman  of Los Angeles challenged the legality of the 's English language policy, resulting in a revision of policy by the end of 2008. Yee introduced , prohibiting businesses from denying services to customers that don't speak English (a modification of the ). in California. The bill was vetoed by Governor  on October 11, 2009.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, during a committee meeting, Yee announced his opposition to the health care plan sponsored by Governor Schwarzenegger and supported by a majority of Democrats in the California State House and Senate, while opposed by a majority of Republicans. Yee's opposition along with the opposition of Democratic Senator and Health Committee Chair  led the ''New York Times'' to predict that California's healthcare bill would be effectively killed.\n\n\nYee had 9 bills signed into law in 2009. He wrote SB 340, which requires businesses to list all automatic renewal offer terms and obtain customer approval, SB 13, which provides $16.3 million for domestic violence shelters, SB 786, which preserves an individual's right to enforce open government laws, and SB 447, which reforms the criminal background check laws for people seeking employment at youth organizations.\n\nOn July 22, 2009, Yee filed an  in support of Governor Schwarzenegger's appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the passing of a law that would criminalize the sale of \"ultraviolent\" video games to minors, claiming that unlike books, movies and CDs, video games \"can contain up to 800 hours of footage with the most atrocious content often reserved for the highest levels and can be accessed only by advanced players after hours upon hours of progressive mastery.\". This action has been met with criticism from gamers that the Californian state senator is wasting resources on a law already judged unconstitutional at a time when the state is already facing economic problems\n\n\nIn 2010 Yee introduced SB 1451, a bill that ensures California students do not learn from a modified curriculum designed by Texas-based textbook publishers. He wrote SB 399, a bill that would give a juvenile sentenced to life in prison without parole, the right to ask for a court review after ten years. He also introduced SB 920, a bill allowing Californians to opt out of having phone books delivered to their homes. The Senate rejected the bill, however.\n\nThe remainder of Yee's bill package focuses on consumer protection, child safety, government transparency, and domestic violence prevention None of his bills have been signed into law this year. Yee was also the third largest taxpayer-funded gas card spender in the senate for 2010 costing $5,314.66. A spokesman said he commutes daily from the  to his district to hold daily and evening meetings to better serve his constituents.\n\nIn April 2010, Yee filed a public records request to discover if any state funds were used by California State Stanislaus Foundation to hire and pay former  Governor  $75,000 to speak at the school's 50th anniversary celebration on June 25. The foundation refused to divulge any information about the fees paid to Palin.\n\nIn response, Yee introduced SB 330, which would require groups to abide by California's Public Records Act. On May 28, 2010, the '''' reported that two California State sources disclosed that Sarah Palin would receive $75,000 for her speaking engagement. Officials would not confirm the amount of the disclosure. In response to the disclosure, Yee said, \"It's rather disappointing that Sarah Palin is asking for nearly $100,000 to speak at this anniversary event when we're looking at state increases in student fees, cancellations of classes and the fact that this money could be going to scholarships… She could do wonders for all of us&nbsp;... by taking this money and donating it back to the foundation.\" The fundraising gala raised a then record $200,000 profit for the Cal State Stanislaus Foundation.\n\n\nCalifornia State Assemblyman  had introduced Assembly Bill 376, a legislation intended to ban a method of harvesting shark fins, but the details of which also stipulates that any commercial or culinary use of ''any'' shark's fin become banned, in particular '''', which Assemblyman Fong describes as: ''\"Anything that is unhealthy, that the culture is practicing, we should stop doing it. We used to  and that was unhealthy for the woman\"''. In what may be a described as a cynical analogy with a long obsolete practice of foot binding is echoed by Hawaii's former first lady  who states that: ''\"shark fin soup is about as cultural as bound feet\"'', however, Senator Leland Yee, while voicing his concern about the illegal shark finning trade, argued that the mentality behind AB376 constitutes ''\"the wrong approach and an unfair attack on Asian culture and cuisine... rather than launch just another attack on Asian American culture, the proponents of the (blanket) ban on shark fin soup should work with us to strengthen conservation efforts\"''.\nCritics said the bill unfairly targeted the Chinese-American community because it only restricts the sale of shark fins, which are used almost exclusively in Chinese cuisine. The bill does not apply to other shark products like oil or meat. \"I think what is most insidious about this particular bill is that it sends a very bad message, not only to us in California but to the rest of the world, that discrimination against Chinese-Americans is OK,\" Yee said.\n\nOn January 19, 2011, conservative political commentator  mocked Chinese president  during his visit to the  on his radio show. \"Hu Jintao  he was speaking and they weren't translating. They normally translate every couple of words. Hu Jintao was just going , ching chong cha,\" said Limbaugh, who imitated Hu's speech. Yee criticized Limbaugh for his remarks: \"His classless act is an insult to over 3,000 years of cultural history, and is a slap in the face to the millions of Chinese Americans who have struggled in this country and to a people who constitute one-quarter of the world's population.\" He demanded an apology from Limbaugh for what he and others view as racist and derogatory remarks. He also organized with civil rights groups&mdash;including ,  and the &mdash;to boycott companies that advertise on . Yee states he has received threatening messages and also received a fax from an unknown sender who made racist comments and labeling him a .\n\n\nOn January 30, 2014, Yee voted in favor of . The proposed bill asked California voters to repeal provisions of  and to permit state universities to consider an applicant's race, ethnicity or national origin in making admissions decisions. After hearing strong opposition to the bill from Asian-American community, Yee, along with Senators  and  who had also voted for the bill, jointly issued a statement on February 27, calling for the bill to be withheld pending further consultations with the \"affected communities.\"  March 12, 2014\n\n\nAn affidavit was filed on March 14, 2014, and unsealed on March 26, 2014, charging Yee with violating Title 18 United States Code Section 1343 and 1346 for honest services wire fraud by allegedly taking bribes from Well Tech, , and for medical marijuana legislation from undercover FBI agents in return for promises of official action; and Title 18 US Code Sections 371, 922(a)(1) and 922(1) for conspiracy to deal firearms without a license and to illegally import firearms from the Philippines by setting up an international weapons trafficking deal with undercover FBI agents. Yee was named with 28 other defendants in the FBI criminal complaint.\n\nYee was accused of dealing firearms without a license and illegally importing firearms. He was also accused of accepting \"tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and cash payments to provide introductions, help a client get a contract, and influence legislation.\" Yee and his campaign staff allegedly accepted at least $42,800 from undercover FBI agents in exchange for carrying out specific requests. Yee discussed the opportunity for an agent to get weapons worth up to $2.5 million from a Muslim separatist group in the  to bring them to the US. He told the agent, \"There's a part of me that wants to be like you. You know how I'm going to be like you? Just be a free agent there.\" Yee was arrested on March 26, 2014, and charged with six counts of depriving the public of honest services and one count of conspiracy to traffic guns without a license. He was released on $500,000 bail.\n\nThe FBI raided Yee's office at the California State Capitol and the San Francisco Chinatown office of the  fraternal organization. This was linked to the arrest, on March 26, 2014, of .\n\nFederal prosecutors on July 25, 2014, added charges of racketeering for trying to get campaign contributions from the owner of an unnamed National Football League team in exchange for supporting legislation favored by league owners and opposed by some players.\n\nOn July 1, 2015, Yee pled guilty to charges of racketeering. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison on February 24, 2016, and was released in June 2020.\n\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Yee filed his candidacy for the . Yee placed fifth in the nonpartisan primary election.\n\nIn November 2012, Yee declared that he would run for  in 2014. On March 27, 2014, after being arrested on corruption charges, Yee's attorney stated that Yee would withdraw his candidacy for Secretary of State of California. Despite the charges pending against Yee, and his withdrawal from the race, Yee received 9.8% of the vote in the non-partisan primary for Secretary of State.\n\nYee's 2010 mayoral race ended in debt, and financing his first statewide race for California Secretary of State in 2014 was problematic. Yet Yee opposed CA Proposition 15 on the June 8, 2010 statewide ballot in California which, had it been enacted, would have raised fees on registered lobbyists in California to fund with matching grants political campaigns for qualified candidates running for the Office of the California Secretary of State as a pilot project in 2014 and 2018.\n\n\nLeland Yee married his wife Maxine in 1972 and together they raised four children who attended San Francisco public schools. He made his home in 's , but turned himself in to the U.S. Marshal's Service on March 25, 2016, to serve a five-year federal prison sentence.\n\nIn February 2013, Yee claimed that he had received a death threat, which was very explicit, and not like previous claimed death threats. The writer stated that he was a trained Marine sniper, and objected to Yee's actions on gun control. On Tuesday, February 12, 2013, Everett Basham, 45, a  engineer, was arrested and charged. Basham later pleaded no contest to the charges, and was sentenced to 5 years in prison.\n\n\nYee was named the California Legislator of the Year by San Francisco Women's Political Committee, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME Local 3299), California Society of Certified Public Accountants, Associated Students of the University of California (Davis)  and the California Faculty Association among others.\n\nYee has also been awarded the following awards:\n\n*Gun Violence Prevention Honor Roll by the .\n*Freedom of Information Award by the \n*Modern Day Abolitionist Award by the San Francisco Collaborative Against Human Trafficking\n*Building a State of Equality by \n*Distinguished Service to Journalism Education Award by the Journalism Association of Community Colleges\n*Service Award by Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse of San Mateo County\n*Scholastic Journalism Award by the Journalism Education Association\n*Beacon Award by the \n*Leadership Award from the California Animal Association\n*Special Friend of Children Award by the \n*Public Official Award by the Society of Professional Journalists\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* - ''''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Gloria was then elected to represent , which encompasses much of San Diego. While in the Assembly, he served as . In December 2020, he became the 37th mayor of San Diego.\n\n\nGloria and his family grew up in the  neighborhood of San Diego, where he attended Hawthorne Elementary School. In 1989, he was a finalist in then-San Diego mayor 's \"Mayor for a Day\" program.  His father was a Production Controller at General Atomics.

Davis was the director of the Aaron Price Fellows Program, a leadership program for high school students focused on civic education and cross-cultural understanding. City of San Diego Official Website |url=https://www.sandiego.gov/mayor/about |access-date=November 7, 2022 |website=www.sandiego.gov}} Mayor Gloria has spent most of his professional life serving the public. He began his career at the County of San Diego’s Health and Human Services Agency and joined the office of Susan Davis as a community representative. In 2002, Gloria became Davis's district director, a position he held until his election to the City Council in 2008. Gloria also served as a San Diego Housing Commissioner from 2005 until 2008. Openly gay, he is also a former chairman of the San Diego LGBT Community Center and was a resident panelist on San Diego's Prostitution Impact Panel.\n\nIn 2012, he was elected as the President of the City Council. A year later, after Bob Filner resigned from office, he took office as the interim mayor.  He was then elected as a representative of the 78th District of the California State Assembly and rose to the position of Majority Whip. He established legislation addressing issues in San Diego, such as housing and homelessness, gun violence, and .  He was the vice chair of the .\n\n\n\n\n\nGloria ran for the District 3 seat on the  vacated by the termed-out  in the 2008 election. He received a plurality of votes in the June 2008 primary, leading to a November run-off election against fellow Democrat Stephen Whitburn, a former journalist, community activist, and ally of then-District 6 Councilmember . Gloria defeated Whitburn with 54.3% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2012 election, Gloria ran for re-election unopposed and was re-elected in the June primary. As of his second term, District 3 included the  of , , , , , , , , , , and .\n\n\n at a  event in 2014]]\nGloria was chair of the city's Budget and Finance Committee from 2011 to 2016. Gloria represented San Diego on the  Board and , where he chaired the transportation committee. As the Council member for District Three, he also took charge in the merger of multiple homelessness organizations in San Diego. By doing so, Gloria aimed to consolidate the city's allocated resources to help end homelessness. In December 2012, at its first meeting after new members took office, Gloria was unanimously elected to serve as Council President, replacing retiring President .\n\nOn December 10, 2014, the city council voted 4–5 on a motion to reappoint Gloria as council president for the new term, with  joining the four council Republicans to defeat the measure. The council then voted 7–2 to appoint Lightner as council president, with Gloria and  in opposition.\n\n\nUpon the resignation of Mayor  on August 30, 2013, Gloria became the interim , with limited powers. His new interim role led to San Diego becoming the second-largest city in the United States, after , with an openly gay mayor. He served until March 3, 2014, when mayor-elect  was sworn in. While serving as interim mayor, Gloria remained the City Councilmember for District 3 and retained the title of City Council President; however, City Council President Pro Tem  carried out the duties of the Council President. Gloria was considered a possible candidate to replace Filner but chose not to run.\n\nAs interim mayor, Gloria reversed several of Filner's actions. He ordered city police and zoning code officers to resume enforcement actions against medical marijuana, re-hired lobbying firms in Sacramento and Washington that Filner had fired, and ordered public records be made more quickly and easily available to citizens.\n\nGloria's administration authored and released a draft of the .\n\n\n's 100th anniversary, 2015.]]\nOn April 7, 2015, Gloria announced that he would run in 2016 for the   held by Assembly Speaker , who was termed out. Gloria was immediately endorsed by Atkins and by Sarah Boot, who had previously announced her own candidacy for Atkins's seat but withdrew upon Gloria's announcement. While running for State Assembly, Gloria promoted the city's climate action plan. On November 8, 2016, Gloria was easily elected over his relatively unknown Republican opponent with the second-highest margin of victory in San Diego County. He was easily re-elected in 2018 with over 70 percent of the vote in both the primary and the general elections.\n\nShortly after assuming office in 2016, Gloria was chosen by Speaker  to join Democratic leadership in the Assembly as Assistant Majority Whip. In January 2018, he became Majority Whip.\n\n\n (front right) in 2021]]\n\n\n\nGloria announced his candidacy for mayor of San Diego in 2020 on January 9, 2019. Gloria's campaign focused on issues such as the housing crisis, affordability, public transportation, and climate change. Gloria was endorsed by several politicians, including Governor , former Governor , and San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott.\n\nOn August 20, 2019, Gloria won the San Diego County Democratic Party's endorsement vote, allowing the party to spend money on behalf of his campaign. Gloria received 70% of the votes, exceeding the 60% required to win. Fellow Democratic rivals  and Tasha Williamson won 14% and 3% of the votes, respectively.\n\nIn August 2019, Gloria was accused of collecting funds for his 2020 re-election campaign to the State Assembly before filing his intent to run with the state, violating state law. Gloria claimed this was a technical oversight and filed the relevant paperwork the next day.\n\nWith the Mayor's office being a \"voter-nominated\" position in San Diego, Gloria and Bry advanced to the general election as the top two vote getters from the primary. On November 3, he was elected mayor, making history as the first Native American and the first Filipino-American to hold this position in a U.S. city with over a million people. He also became San Diego's first mayor of color and its first openly gay mayor. Gloria was sworn in on December 10, 2020.\n\n\n'''Infrastructure'''\n\nTo revitalize the city's infrastructure, Gloria proposed a budget for Fiscal Year 2023 called the “Ready to Rebuild” proposal. At just under $5 billion total, the budget increased the allocation of funds to street maintenance by $27.6 million, parks and recreation services by $4.3 million, and left $55.8 million from the American Rescue Plan Act money given to the city for the next fiscal year. From the budget initiatives, several projects that support San Diego's Capital Improvements Program (CIP) are underway to repair the city's infrastructure. CIP functions as the plan to improve the capital and infrastructure of San Diego over several years. These projects focus on areas that provide important services for San Diego residents such as fire stations, libraries, and parks.\n\n'''Public safety'''\n\nIn 2021, Gloria proposed reforms for policing and public safety in San Diego, many of which were formed in response to the citizens of San Diego. For one of the items, Gloria promised to adequately fund the Commission on Police Practices (CPP), which is an independent organization in charge of overseeing and investigating incidents involving the San Diego Police. There is also a clause in the proposal calling for San Diego police to refrain from using military-grade weapons unless absolutely necessary. However, as of mid-2024, some parts of the reforms have not been implemented. For example, the city has not yet adopted an ordinance to guide the creation of the Commission on Police Practices, and there are still no new training procedures for the city's police officers on unconscious and implicit bias.\n\n'''Homelessness and housing'''\n\nIn 2023, San Diego issued more housing permits than it had in decades, nearly doubling the number of permits issued in 2022. The increase in housing supply followed housing reforms that eased housing construction.\n\nAs mayor, Gloria repeatedly called homelessness one of his top priorities. While San Diego has added hundreds of beds for the homeless during Gloria's tenure, it has also experienced a record increase in the number of unsheltered people in its  area and a record rise in the number of homeless deaths.\n\nDuring his campaign, Gloria proposed the use of housing with wrap-around services, making emergency shelters only available for triage, and replacing temporary shelters with permanent housing for those in need.\n\nIn 2021, Gloria proposed a budget for the fiscal year of roughly $10 million in investments toward homelessness and housing in San Diego, emphasizing “a compassionate, person-centered approach.” The budget allocates funds for creating a new department called Homelessness Strategies and Solutions. A majority of the proposed investments will go to interim shelter beds. The proposal also invests $1 million into funding for the People Assisting the Homeless Coordinated Street Outreach Program. This program uses \"a person-centered, neighborhood-based approach\" to establish trust with homeless residents and link them to housing and services. Rapid-rehousing programs in the city will also benefit from the proposal's funding of 100 additional households and rental assistance.\n\nIn late June 2023, Todd Gloria signed the \"Unsafe Camping Ordinance\" following its passage by the  by a 5-4 vote. The law prohibits tent encampments in all public spaces in San Diego if shelter beds are available, and imposes a complete ban on encampments in parks, canyons, near schools, near transit stations, and near homeless shelters. Gloria defended the law, saying that \"there has to be consequences for illegal behavior in the city. Now we’re saying you cannot occupy public spaces under certain circumstances\", and that the city had expanded its shelter programs. He also stated he wanted to avoid the impression \"that it’s easy to be homeless here and you can do drugs in my city\". However, a spokesperson for the San Diego Housing Commission said that all of the city's shelters get filled by mid-day, and that most people referred to shelters by police and other authorities did not get placed, reporting that less than one-third of people referred to shelters in June 2023 were placed in one. Some of the city's homeless population reported getting displaced by police when no shelters were available, and one police officer opined that the new law did not help efforts and was \"all the same\".\n\nDespite those efforts, finding affordable housing in San Diego remains challenging, with nearly 60% of homes in San Diego having a listing price exceeding $1 million in 2023. The city's median home price is $910,000, making it the fourth most expensive among the 30 largest cities in the U.S. The average monthly rent in San Diego has risen to $3,175, placing it as the third-highest in the nation, only $7 less than that of San Francisco.\n\nOn April 4, 2024, Gloria announced a tentative 35-year lease agreement to convert a 65,000-square-foot commercial building at Kettner Boulevard and Vine Street in Middletown into the city's largest permanent homeless shelter.  To be called Hope @ Vine, the shelter would add 1,000 beds to the city system, and the long lease would ensure that the city has long-term access to the beds.  On July 17, 2024, the Mayor announced a tentative agreement between the city and the property owner. The lease would be for 30 years at a rate of $1.95 per square foot, with annual increases of 3.5% and an estimated $12.5 million for facility maintenance over the lease term. However, San Diego's independent budget analyst (IBA) urged caution because, as proposed, the shelter would be above market rate, costing $72 million in rent throughout the 30-year lease.

She previously served as City Council member for Oakland's 4th District. Upon inauguration on January 3, 2011, she became Oakland's first female mayor. Quan ran an unsuccessful campaign for reelection , losing the mayoral race to , a member of the Oakland City Council.\n\n\nQuan was born in . Her family ties in the  date back to the 1870s, when her great-grandfather immigrated to  from , . Quan's husband, Dr. Floyd Huen, is a doctor of  for .\n\n\nQuan was on the  School Board for 12 years, starting in 1990 after organizing a citywide parent organization, Save Our Schools. As a parent leader she helped save the music program in the Oakland Schools. She served as chair of the California Urban Schools Association, the Asian Pacific Islanders School Board Members Association (APISBMA), and the Council of Urban Boards Association (the urban caucus of the National School Board Association representing the nation's 100 largest districts). She was appointed by the  to represent School Boards on the Title I Rules Making Committee. In these roles she advocated for more funding for urban and immigrant students, more inclusion of minority community history in textbooks, comprehensive school services and after school programs, and expansion of pre-school and adult education programs.\n\nIn 1996 with Quan as president, the school board instituted a program using Standard English Program strategies to teach standard English to African American students. The move created  with the perception Oakland schools were teaching students \"\" because there was discussion about Ebonics being used as a teaching tool.\n\nIn 2002, Jean Quan was elected to her first term as Council Member for Oakland District 4 (, , , , , , , , and ).\n\nIn July 2010, Quan along with fellow City Council member and mayoral candidate  were investigated by Oakland police for their actions during a protest following the manslaughter verdict of . Police claimed Quan and Kaplan joined a \"human chain\" which prevented officers from clearing a street, while the two countered they were acting as \"peacekeepers\". No charges were filed against the Councilwomen.\nQuan was the victim of a street robbery in September of the same year, in front of the Dimond neighborhood  supermarket. Quan attributed the crime to lack of employment opportunities in Oakland.\n\n\nIn Oakland's , was Quan the winner with 53,897 votes from 105,769 valid votes (50.96% of the valid votes).\n\n\n\n\nWithin her first six months in office, Mayor Quan met with more than 3,000 residents in eight town hall meetings. The resulting priorities reportedly developed by residents at these sessions were to help focus the city's and community's agenda.\nHer election as Oakland's first female mayor, and the first Chinese-American female mayor of a major U.S. city, resulted in high visibility nationally and internationally. Quan capitalized on this visibility by traveling to and meeting with potential trade and business partners for the City and .\n\n\nDuring the second week of Quan's tenure in January 2011, it was discovered  chief  was a top-two candidate for the open position of  chief. Two weeks later, Quan introduced a plan for the police department which included updating the technological staff and rehiring 10 of the 80 officers who were laid off the previous year. Batts announced his intention to remain in Oakland a few days later, but eventually resigned in October of the same year.\n\nA  poll taken just before Mayor Quan's first 100 days revealed that her job performance \"garners the approval of the city's residents by a 2–1 margin.\" The Capitol Weekly named Mayor Quan one of the top ten \"Good\" Mayors in the state. A KPIX poll six months later, taken shortly after the resignation of Chief Batts, listed an approval rating of 28 percent, with 69 percent responding with \"little or no confidence\" the mayor's ability to reduce the city's crime problem.\n\nQuan remained unpopular in the city of Oakland.  A 2013  poll found 60 percent of residents disapproved of her job performance and 65 percent said the city was on the wrong track, with crime the voters' primary concern.  The Asian-American community gave her the lowest marks, with 67 percent disapproving of her performance.\n\n\n\nMayor Quan received widespread national criticism in October 2011 for her handling of the Occupy Oakland protest.  On October 11, Mayor Quan visited the protest site. Thirteen days later more than 500 police officers from Oakland, other area police departments, and the State of California were directed to use tear gas and batons to clear the plaza where the protests were being held. Mayor Quan was in Washington, D.C. at the time on city business. Quan issued a statement the next morning commending the police chief \"for a generally peaceful resolution to a situation\". That night, hundreds of police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and  to subdue and arrest over 100 protesters, though denied the use of rubber bullets and flashbang grenades during the press release. The mayor's office was flooded with demands that protesters be released and her legal adviser opposed the police action and threatened to resign.\n\nBy November 14, two of Mayor Quan's top advisors, legal advisor  and Deputy Mayor Sharon Cornu, had resigned.\n\nQuan was criticized for apparent insensitivity at an Oakland City Council meeting on March 6, 2013.  In a conversation with war veteran Scott Olsen, she accused him of having a \"chip on his shoulder\".  Later, Olsen tweeted, \"J. Quan told me she realizes I have a chip on my shoulder. Insulting, more like a broken skull and brain trauma.\"\n\n\nOn December 7, 2011, the Oakland City Clerk's office approved the request by the Committee to Recall Jean Quan to begin collecting signatures to qualify a recall measure for a future ballot. The committee failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for a measure on the November 2012 ballot.\n\n\nQuan ran for reelection in 2014 but lost. Schaaf was sworn in on January 5, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The couple had four children, Joanne Marie  Roots, Judith Ann, John Paul and (Ernani) James. They settled in Los Angeles in 1939 or 1940, and  Bernardi began his second career as a contractor, building custom homes. After their children were grown, Lucille Bernardi went to work in the county probation department as a records clerk. When older, she suffered from , and Bernardi, by then a City Council member, would bring her to work with him from their home in  to watch television in his office., ''Los Angeles Times'', October 13, 1993. She died in 1993. Ernani Bernardi remarried in  November 2001 to Eve Troutman.\n\nBernardi was described at age 74 in 1985 as \"crusty, . . . short, bald and bespectacled,\" and four years later he was said to have \"a  sense of humor.\"\n\nAs he aged, his hearing deteriorated, and he wore special headphones at council meetings so he could hear what was going on. Even at age 86, he had \"a booming voice and aggressive style.\"\n\nHe died of heart failure at the age of 94 on January 4, 2006.\n\n\nBernardi's father, Alfonso, was a music teacher who taught his son how to play the saxophone.\nErnani went on to become a musician, performing under the pseudonym '''Noni Bernardi''' as lead alto sax for several of big bands of the era such as those of ,  and .

The tribute is in the 7000 block of Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe ex-councilman continued playing the sax well into his eighties. In 2000 he was a regular at age 88 with his band booked, among other places, at a retro  restaurant called Leon's Steak House in .

One \"City Hall lobbyist\" opined that the measure in some way was a payback for Bernardi's public criticism of his colleagues. Yet he was reelected in 1989 by 55% to 45% over Fire Captain Lyle Hall, \"who had more money, a more sophisticated mail campaign and labor unions' support that translated into scores of ready volunteers.\" Bernardi also picked up support from Latino leaders in his new district.\n\nBy the time Bernardi retired in 1993, the 7th District was 70 percent Latino and 19 percent African-American, encompassing one of Los Angeles's poorest areas. Registered voters were 39 percent Anglo, 30 percent Latino and 19 percent African-American.\n\nHis tenure of 32 years has been surpassed only by the 35 years of Council Member .\n\n\nBernardi was nicknamed \"Mr. No\" because of his opposition to city spending, and he was known as the City Council's \"\" because of his \"pesky pursuit of lost causes,\" but in 1985 he was successful in forcing the City Council to put a tough campaign-reform law on the April ballot after he circulated petitions that would have required a vote on an even tougher law. He did this by \"enlisting the support of the League of Women Voters and a ragtag group made up mostly of retirees to qualify an initiative for the ballot.\"\n\nBernardi listed his campaign-reform success as among his most satisfying achievements, as well as an ordinance requiring all residential developments of five or more units to set aside at least 15 percent of the units for low and moderate-income families. He also supported rent control.\n\nHe led successful campaigns for  amendments that limited police and firefighter pensions and that did away with a requirement that the city pay comparable wages to those of private industry.  \"I think he reflects a philosophy of misery\" because of his efforts to cut allocations for human services, fellow Councilman  said. The ''Los Angeles Times'' added:\n\nYet, there is a compassionate side to Bernardi. After visiting Tent City, a shelter for the homeless set up across from City Hall during the 1984 Christmas season, Bernardi returned to his office and began calling food stores and restaurants to solicit food donations. When a grocery store donated a box of uncooked beans, Bernardi opened up the City Hall kitchen and cooked the beans himself.\n\nHe was seen as a \"loner\" on the 15-member City Council, lacking the spirit of compromise, thus limiting his political effect, yet longtime council president  praised him for probably saving the city \"millions of dollars over the years with his questioning.\" In a ceremony marking his 25th anniversary on the council, he was presented with the \"no\" voting button from his desk, \"which Councilman  quipped was 'worn out' from overuse.\"\n\nIn 1987 he voted against supporting a Los Angeles Festival of Arts with money and services because it was \"chintzy\" for a $5.8 million festival to ask for help. He was joined by Council Members  and , who said not enough minority artists were represented.\n\nIn 1988 Bernardi provided $70,000 from his $641,978-a-year office budget for police task forces to combat burglaries and drug trafficking in his district, and, even though he supported a lobbying group called FAIR, \"devoted to using the harshest possible measures to reduce illegal immigration,\" he helped establish a hiring hall to get immigrant workers off the street.\n\nCritics claimed that \"as an aging white man,\" he lacked \"modern-day sensitivity\" when, in August 1991, he called African-American Councilman  \"Curly\" during an \"emotionally charged discussion of racism.\" Ridley-Thomas rebuked Bernardi for the \"condescending and racist\" remark, and Bernardi apologized. \nIn his last years on the council, he continued casting \"no\" votes: against building the , against establishing a , against declaring . He said he didn't mind recognizing the civil rights leader, but did not want to give city workers another day off.\n\nOne of his final campaigns was against the practice of the  City Council drawing  its own district boundaries. He urged that instead the boundaries should be set by a special commission of retired Municipal Court judges. In a related comment, on his last day in office he issued a press release applauding the U.S. Supreme Court in its '''' decision invalidating the drawing of a serpentine-shaped Congressional district whose parts seemed to have nothing to do with each other than the fact they were inhabited mostly by black people.\n\n\n\n\nBernardi ran for  while he was in his last few months on the City Council in , saying that the other candidates failed to address issues that were important to himmostly slashing the size and cost of government. He ran a low-budget, no-frills campaign, and in the end received just 1 percent of the citywide vote.\n\n\nIn 1994 Bernardi sued the city of Los Angeles and its , alleging that the agency violated the state's  when it was considering . He helped finance the costs of his lawsuit by selling a  of several  performing his favorite tunes. Eventually, appellate courts and the state supreme court ruled in favor of Bernardi in the main thrust of his claim, which effectively set a cap on the amount of money the agency could spend on the project.\n\nIn the 1990s he spoke against the idea of establishing  as part of a proposed  reform process.\n\nIn 1999, City Council President  appointed Bernardi to a committee to oversee the spending of $744 million in bond funds for police and fire stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*, ''LAObserved'', 2006-01-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was a  and , and later became involved with the Chula Vista Explorer Scouts.\n\nPadilla's first career venture was into law enforcement.  After graduating from Bonita Vista High School, he became the youngest cadet accepted into the Southwestern Police Academy. A police officer for thirteen years, he served as a Detective, specializing in  and  before entering the public arena. He served for a period as the president of the Chula Vista Police Officers Association.\n\nWhile a police officer, Padilla returned to school, and received his  in . Between 1989 and 1990, he was appointed by the City Council to various city boards and commissions, including the Board of Ethics, and Safety Commission.\n\nPadilla worked as a substitute teacher for the Sweetwater Union High School District.\n\n\nPadilla was elected to the Chula Vista City Council in 1994.

The election was also historic in that all three candidates running (Salas, Padilla, and Petra Barajas) were Hispanic, guaranteeing that the city would elect its first Hispanic mayor.

In addition to two incumbent city council members, he also received the endorsement of a council member-elect who had won election in the first-round of the city's elections.\n\nWith much political overlap between Salas and Padilla, the race was seen as being debated on which candidate had the superior experience to lead the city.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Salas and Padilla criticized each other for accepting campaign contributions from different real estate developers.\n\nA tense race from its inception, in the closing days of the general election, things became particularly hostile as both candidates assailed each other's records. Additionally, Padilla's campaign circulated literature quoting Salas as having used the word \"\" in a quote to the newspaper El Latino.\n\nVoter turnout was significantly lower in the 2002 election than it had been in the previous two elections.\n\n\n\nIn collaboration the San Diego Unified Port District, Padilla played a key role in initiating the Bay-front Master Plan, an effort to develop  waterfront to hot public parks, hotels, restaurants, shops and new housing.\n\nWhile mayor, he launched a Give a Book drive, which saw the donation of more than 100,000 books to underprivileged children in San Diego County.\n\nIn 2003,  executive editor  wrote a column interpreted from comments Padilla made about the Mid-Bayfront community during a speech at the .

During the campaign, Cox's supporter seized on him for having hired a bodyguard with city funds.\n\n\nPadilla's tenure on the California Coastal Commission, which he had been appointed to in 2005, ended in 2007.\n\nIn early 2011, Chula Vista's city council failed to appoint Padilla to a full 4-year term in his own right in a 3–2 vote, just hours after he was sworn in as vice chairman at the commission's annual luncheon.\n\nIn 2014 Padilla sought to re-enter elective office and sought a seat on the Chula Vista City Council. In what became the closest election in city history, his campaign received broad organizational and political support, but lost the bid by only 2 votes out of nearly 39,000 cast. He was defeated by John McCann. McCann was a former Chula Vista City Council member, having previously served from 2002 through 2010. McCann, a Republican, had, in fact, originally succeeded Padilla as the officeholder for seat 2 on the City Council in 2002, and had, as councilman-elect in 2002, endorsed Padilla in the second-round of his first mayoral race.\n\n\nAfter his extraordinarily narrow defeat in the 2014 city council election, Padilla opted to seek a different seat on the Chula Vista City Council in 2016, and was elected. This election was the first time that an openly-gay man had won an election to city office in Chula Vista.\n\nMay 31, 2017, Padilla was again appointed to the California Coastal Commission, this time by California Assembly Speaker .

Solis previously served as the 25th  from 2009 to 2013, as part of the  of  . She is a member of the  and served in the  from 2001 to 2009, representing the  and  of  that include  and the .\n\nSolis was raised in , by immigrant parents from  and . She earned degrees from the  and the  and worked for two federal agencies in  Returning to her native state, she was elected to the  Board of Trustees in 1985, the  in 1992, and the  in 1994. She was the first  woman to serve in the State Senate, and was reelected there in 1998. Solis sought to pass  legislation. She was the first female recipient of the  in 2000.\n\nSolis defeated a long-time Democratic incumbent as part of getting elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, where she focused mainly on labor causes and environmental work. She was reelected easily to four subsequent terms. In December 2008, President-elect  announced his intention to nominate Solis as the next secretary of labor. She took office after being confirmed by the  in February 2009, becoming the first Latina to lead one of the . There she focused on workplace safety issues and on strengthening compliance with wage and hour laws. In January 2013, Solis stepped down from her post as Labor Secretary.\n\nReturning to the area of her upbringing, in April 2014, Solis formally announced a campaign for a seat on the non-partisan . Solis won the seat outright in a June 3 election and was sworn in on December 1. As Supervisor, Solis successfully lobbied the state to allocate funds for the . One of her areas of responsibility was , where her main priority was dealing with  and the lack of . She was unopposed for re-election as Supervisor, which took place in June 2018. She served one-year terms as  from 2015 to 2016 and again from 2020 to 2021.\n\n\nSolis was born in , as the daughter of immigrant parents who had met in citizenship class and married in 1953: Juana Sequeira (b.&nbsp;1926, from ) and Raúl Solís (from ). Her father was a   in Mexico and, after coming to the United States, worked at the Quemetco  in the  in the . There he again organized for the Teamsters, to gain better health care benefits for workers, but also contracted . Her mother worked for over 20&nbsp;years on the assembly line of  once her children were all of school age, belonged to the , and was outspoken about working conditions. She stressed the importance of education and was a devout . Her Catholic faith, she said, \"is a part of my life. My faith is what motivates me.\"\n\nHilda Solis is the third oldest of seven siblings (four sisters, two brothers) and grew up in a  in . She had to help raise her youngest siblings, and later said of her childhood: \"It wasn't what you would call the all-American life for a young girl growing up. We had to mature very quickly.\" She graduated from , where she saw a lack of support for those wishing to continue their education, including a  who told her mother that \"Your daughter is not college material. Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary.\" However, another counselor did encourage her to attend college, and even went to her house to help her fill out an application. She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead.\n\nShe was the first of her family to go to college, being accepted into the Educational Opportunity Program (which assists low-income, first-generation college students) at  (Cal Poly Pomona) and paying for it with the help of government grants and part-time jobs. She graduated in 1979 with a  in . She then earned a  degree at the  in 1981.\n\n\nSolis served near the end of the  in the White House Office of Hispanic Affairs, where she was editor-in-chief of a newsletter during a 1980–1981 Washington semester internship as part of her master's program. At the start of the  in 1981, she became a  at the  division of the , but her dislike for 's policies motivated her to leave later that year.\n\nIn Washington, she met Sam H. Sayyad, whom she subsequently married. He owns an automobile repair center in . The couple lives in a modest house in , not far from where she grew up.\n\nReturning to California, Solis became director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program in 1982, to help disadvantaged youth gain necessary preparation for college. In particular, she worked with the . Friends urged her to try for elective office, and so in 1985, she ran for the board of trustees of the  District. She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer. She was reelected in 1989. During her time on the board, she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought to increase the number of d faculty positions held by minorities and women. She joined several California chambers of commerce, women's organizations, and Latino organizations. She gained added political visibility in 1991 when she was named to the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance by  , a political mentor. Solis also served as chief of staff for State Senator .\n\n\nSolis had the opportunity to run for the  when, after California's 1991 , the incumbent Dave Elder in Solis's  was shifted into another district, while her new representative retired. In the June 1992 Democratic  to fill the open seat, Solis's opponents had the endorsement of powerful State Assemblyman  and the former incumbent. Solis had the support of Molina and U.S. Representative , in an effort that focused on door-to-door campaigning and featured Solis's mother making s for campaign volunteers. Solis came out on top of a three-way Democratic race, receiving 49&nbsp;percent of the vote and besting her nearest competitor, future Assemblyman Ed Chavez, who received 31&nbsp;percent. In the , Solis garnered 61&nbsp;percent of the vote against Republican Gary Woods's 34&nbsp;percent, and gained election to the Assembly. She was one of seven Latinos who won election to the Assembly in the wake of the redistricting and became collectively known as ''Los Siete''. Solis was among the most liberal of this ideologically diverse group.\n\nIn her one term in the State Assembly, Solis was prominent in the debate on , backing a bill to allow immigrants in the United States illegally to attend California colleges as long as they were residing in the state. She backed labor and opposed the tobacco industry in supporting a bill that banned smoking in all workplaces. She served on committees dealing with education, labor, and environmental issues, including a new committee that dealt with groundwater contamination and landfill leakage. She was not known as a strong orator.\n\nThe Democratic incumbent in Solis's , , gave up his office when he received the 1994 Democratic nomination for the statewide office of . Solis ran for the seat, won the Democratic primary with 63&nbsp;percent of the vote against two opponents, and then won the 1994 general election with 63&nbsp;percent of the vote against Republican Dave Boyer's 33&nbsp;percent. She became the first Hispanic woman to ever serve in the State Senate and the first woman ever to represent the San Gabriel Valley; she was also the Senate's youngest member at that time. She was reelected in 1998 with 74&nbsp;percent of the vote.\n\nIn the State Senate, Solis authored 17&nbsp;bills to prevent  and championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as \"a big believer that government, if done right, can do a lot to improve the quality of people's lives\". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the  from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor  vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a  the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with  on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995  raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70  workers existing in -like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of  laws. Republican state senator  later said that Solis was \"a committed liberal in the pockets of labor\", but Republican State Senate Leader  said of her, \"We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff.\"\n\nSolis was an environmental activist in the State Senate, due to concerns that stemmed from a childhood spent within smelling distance of the  and making frequent visits to the . In 1997, she worked to pass  legislation with a law to protect low-income and minority communities from newly located landfills, pollution sources, and other environmental hazards in neighborhoods that already had such sites. She got the bill, SB 1113, approved over the strong opposition of various business interests, water contractors, and some state government agencies, but Wilson vetoed it. She returned in 1999 with a weakened measure, which was signed by Governor . Calling for \"the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws\", it represented the first legislation of its kind in the nation and is considered a landmark.\n\nSolis faced controversy with her 1999 legislation, SB&nbsp;63, that lowered the carpool restrictions on the  from three or more occupants to two or more. When this took effect in January 2000, it quickly resulted in greatly increased volume on the busway and protests from bus riders and prior carpoolers. Solis at first defended the change, but it continued to have a detrimental effect on the busway and did not improve flow in the regular traffic lanes.  By May, she was co-sponsoring legislation to rescind the change and restore the higher occupancy requirement, which passed and took effect in July 2000.\n\nDue to her work in overcoming obstacles for environmental justice, in 2000 Solis was given the  by the , and was praised as \"a politician who hasn't shied away from challenging the old boy network both within and without the Latino community\". She was the first woman to win the award, and gained appearances in '''' and '''' magazines and on the '''' show. Art Torres, who had become  chair, said of Solis, \"She's going to be a national star\".\n\n\n\nTerm limits would have prevented Solis from seeking reelection to the State Senate. After months of deliberation, she decided to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000 against 18-year incumbent  in the , which consisted largely of working class Hispanics and . This action was criticized by Hispanics and others, and only two members of Congress,  and , supported her. Martínez was more conservative than many of his constituents, as he had supported the  (NAFTA), opposed , and supported bans on specific  procedures.  He was also criticized for lacking effort and neglecting his district. Solis was able to obtain the support of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor (which called her a \"warrior for working families\"), , , the  and the .  With their help, Solis outspent Martínez by a 4-to-1 margin and had hundreds of volunteers working for her.\n\nShe defeated the incumbent Martínez in the March 2000 Democratic primary by a 69&nbsp;percent to 31&nbsp;percent margin. On primary night, Martínez called Solis \"obnoxious\" and accused her of untruthful advertising. He subsequently switched to the , and urged Latinos to vote against her, to no great effect. Without a Republican opponent in the general election, Solis beat three little-known challengers from  and won 79&nbsp;percent of the vote.\n\n implementation]]\nUpon arriving in the House of Representatives, Solis was named freshman class , making her responsible for collecting votes from first-term Democrats.  '''' magazine named her one of its \"Ten Freshmen to Watch\", and said that her election \"is a sign of things to come in California and a generational changing of the guard in the \".  Solis commissioned for her new office a painting of the  with the  behind it, so that she would not forget her roots. Her Washington apartment was tiny.\n\nAs congresswoman, Solis was most known for her work on environmental issues as a member of the , the , and the . She made the promotion of  a priority and sponsored the Southern California portion of the California Wild Heritage Act, which would create or enlarge many wilderness areas. In 2003 she sponsored legislation that funded a  study to designate a large swath of the , the  and , and the  and , a .  (In 2013, after Solis had left the Obama administration, the Park Service recommended proceeding with a greatly reduced version of the original proposal; while other advocates evinced disappointment, Solis said it was still a positive step and that Congress could expand the area in whatever legislation it undertook.)\n\nSolis was not a member of the , but championed the  and was the only member of Congress on the board of , a pro-union organization that strongly supports the act, for whom she served as treasurer starting in 2004. On trade she voted against both the  and the , and also expressed opposition to a purposed bilateral , citing concerns about human rights violations. Solis opposed legislation that would soften job safety requirements. She received 100&nbsp;percent ratings from several pro-labor groups for the years 2005 through 2007, and was a major recipient of union political donations.  co-founder  is one of Solis's role models.\n\n]]\nDuring her tenure in the House Solis was an advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. She was one of the leading opponents of  a House bill sponsored by Wisconsin Congressman  and voted against it.\n\nSolis supported legislation aimed at reducing the number of  within  and  communities and sponsored a bill, that became law in 2003, that granted U.S.&nbsp;citizenship to immigrants after one year of military service instead of the previous three years.\n\nSolis is  and . Along with 47 other Catholic members of Congress, she sent a letter to Cardinal  of Washington, D.C., in order to dissuade him from refusing them the  because of their pro-choice legislative voting. Solis signed a \"Statement of Principles,\" stating her commitment to her faith as well as her disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church on some issues. They stated that on those issues, such as abortion rights, they decided to follow their conscience instead of the Church teachings.\n\nSolis was a member of the  and rated a lifetime \"liberal quotient\" of 99&nbsp;percent from , and a lifetime 2&nbsp;percent rating from the . From 2006 to 2008 she wrote blog entries for . Solis believed in the importance of , and as a House member continued relationships she had established with up-and-coming political figures in her district, including California State Assemblywoman  and  Mayor Sharon Martinez.\n\n\nAfter the 2000 census and subsequent redistricting, Solis's area became part of . She was reelected for additional terms in 2002, 2004, and 2006 by very large margins, twice with no Republican in opposition. She ran unopposed in 2008.\nSolis chaired the Health and the Environment Task Force of the  during the . However, during 2006 and 2007, Solis was part of a falling out between several female representatives and , leader of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, arguing there was a \"lack of respect afforded to women members of the Hispanic Caucus,\" which Baca denied. She had previously broken ties with the caucus'  over its campaign contributions to Baca's sons. Baca responded that Solis \"was a kiss-up\" to Speaker of the House , a remark for which he later apologized. Solis was indeed considered a close ally of Pelosi, which helped her get a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee. She considered running for the position of  for the , but deferred to incumbent  after  chose to run for caucus chair, which Larson had been running for. Solis's aggressive fundraising for the  gained her a vice chair position on the . At the time of her selection to Obama's cabinet, she had been elected 2nd vice chair of the Hispanic Caucus and was considered a potential candidate for a leadership position in the House.\n\nSolis was a strong supporter of 's ; when that fell short,  aggressively sought her support, as part of strengthening his appeal to Hispanic voters. She supported Clinton's effort to establish a  and was a co-sponsor of a House bill to create one. Solis did not become wealthy from her political career; by 2008, she and her husband's main assets consisted of retirement funds and his auto shop, valued at under $100,000.\n\n\n and -to-be  look on.]]\nOn December 18, 2008, sources close to the  identified Solis as the President-elect's choice for , the last cabinet position yet to be filled. The selection earned praise from the  and other labor organizations, but was not well received by business groups and the anti-union group . The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19. Solis's successor was chosen in a ; she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary (from which her past mentee  emerged on top and eventually won the general election).\n.]]\nSolis's confirmation hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the . Committee chair  repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis declined to discuss specific policy issues, including the . Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a  was placed on the nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican  pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official  as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.\n\n\n\nA vote on Solis's committee confirmation was set on February 5, but postponed after news that Solis's husband Sam Sayyad had just paid $6,400 in outstanding state and local tax liens dating back to 1993 for his auto repair business. Sayyad had filed a separate tax return from Solis, and intended to contest the lien as they were for business taxes he believed to have already paid. A White House spokesperson stated Solis should not be penalized for any mistakes that her husband may have made. The revelations came in the wake of several other Obama nominations troubled or derailed due to tax issues. Committee Republicans subsequently indicated they would not blame Solis, but were still concerned about her ties to American Rights at Work. On February 11, 2009, the committee approved her nomination by voice vote with two votes opposed. After still further delays, Republicans agreed not to subject her nomination to a  and on February 24, 2009, Solis was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 80–17. She resigned from the House and was sworn into her new position that evening. (A ceremonial swearing in featuring Vice President  was later held on March 13.)\n\n in 2010]]\n\nSolis became the first Hispanic woman to serve as a regular U.S. cabinet member and the first cabinet secretary with  descent. She also became the first Hispanic Secretary of Labor. Solis felt that under the , the department had become unimportant and lacking in power, and that its actions reflected a pro-business agenda. Accordingly, she hoped to reinvigorate it.\n\n in 2010, next to a mural depicting his brother  ]]\n\nIn her first days as secretary, Solis affirmed an extension to unemployment benefits specified by the , and joined Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force. In her first major speech as secretary, Solis pleased community forum attendees at 's  by vowing more aggressive enforcement of workplace protection laws, saying \"You can rest assured that there is a new sheriff in town.\"  In late March 2009, Solis vowed to add 250&nbsp;investigators to the department's Wage and Hour Division after a  report showed the division's enforcement of wage laws was quite inadequate; the staffing up was completed by the end of the year. In late May 2009, Solis suspended immigrant guest worker regulations related to s adopted in the final days of the Bush administration; the move earned plaudits from the . In July 2009, she expressed concern about workplace deaths among Hispanics, which she said they were especially vulnerable to (her continuing attention to issues such as this during her tenure would lead to Hispanic workers considering her their champion). In October 2009, the  levied the largest fine in its history on  for failing to fix safety problems following the 2005 . Business groups such as the  complained that Solis was forging a less cooperative relationship, one that departed from the Bush administration's \"compliance assistance\" approach; the Labor Department said that compliance assistance was still an important part of the new strategy.\n\n at the Department of Labor was the first of its kind.]]\n\nFor 2010, Solis's agenda was to enact some ninety new rules and regulations intended to grant more power to unions and to workers. Whether Solis would try to revive  ergonomics rules that had been discarded in the early days of the Bush administration, and that business groups continued to oppose, was unclear. In the wake of the April 2010  in , the worst in the U.S. in forty years, Solis announced that the Labor Department's  would conduct an internal review of its enforcement of the  mine prior to the accident.  She also requested that the  provide an independent analysis of that review. (By the end of her tenure, however, some safety experts said she had fallen short of getting any meaningful new regulatory scheme in place in the wake of the disaster.) Later that month, Solis and the department hosted the first-ever meeting of the ; they discussed how to accelerate job creation in their respective countries. Solis also faced disgruntlement from a local of the  representing her own employees, who were unhappy that a longstanding  program reduced under the George W. Bush administration had not been restored. The department said the program was modern and fair and that it was part of ongoing contract negotiations with the local. The year also saw the department trying to crack down on firms that illegally use summer internships for free labor, by clarifying what may constitute an unpaid academic internship; the move brought resistance from universities.  The year additionally saw Solis leading an administration campaign against farmers who employed children or underpaid workers. (Proposed new rules in this area were dropped in 2012, however, following adamant criticism from conservatives and agricultural groups.)\n\n facility in 2012 with Governor  ]]\n\nIn February 2011, as  over  Governor 's proposal to limit that state's public employee unions' collective bargaining rights, and similar proposals were made in other states, Solis spoke out strongly and emotionally against such moves, saying \"[those governors] aren't just asking workers to tighten their belts, they're demanding they give up their uniquely American rights as workers.\" Overall, however, the Obama administration did not speak out forcefully against these moves.\n\nIn October 2012, Solis defended the work of the , after the  it puts out monthly reported that  had fallen below eight percent for this first time since Obama took office. Some critics, including former  CEO , charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the .  Solis said, \"I'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They've been doing these calculations. These are our best trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement.\" For the year, the Labor Department set a record for the most back pay it had ever collected due to wage violations, $280&nbsp;million going to some 300,000&nbsp;workers. Workplace fatalities in construction and general industrial sectors reached an all-time low.\n\n\n\nOn January 9, 2013, Solis tendered her resignation as Secretary of Labor, becoming one of several Cabinet members deciding not to stay on for Obama's second term. Her last day in office was January 22, 2013.\n\nSolis, who had never become part of the inner circle of presidential advisors, said it had been a difficult decision and Obama praised her work as secretary. Reflecting upon her tenure, Solis generally garnered praise from labor unions and leading Democrats for her stricter enforcement of job safety regulations and more aggressive pursuit of wage and hour violators. Other leaders and analysts in the labor field thought her performance as secretary was underwhelming, with minimal public visibility and no memorable legacy left behind. All agreed that she operated in a difficult political environment, with the effects of the  still being felt, Republicans staunchly opposed to labor-based initiatives, and the Obama administration's attentions focused elsewhere. Business groups, meanwhile, continued to characterize her as having been uncooperative in her dealings with them.\n\nDuring early 2014, reports emerged that the , the , and the  had begun investigating Solis during 2012 for possible violations of fundraising rules by federal officials during her time as Labor Secretary. Allegations were made that Solis solicited subordinates for funds for the . A spokesperson for Solis said that she believed she had done nothing wrong. The matter was also being looked into by the  and its chair, Representative , who said there was evidence supporting the allegations. By early 2016, no further word had emerged on any of these investigations.\n\n\nSolis's departure from the Labor Department was speculated as a preparation for a run for a seat on the  in 2014, to replace the term-limited incumbent,  supervisor .  Officially, Solis only said that she wanted to rest, reconnect with her local community after twelve years in Washington, and spend time with her mother, who was 87 years old at the time.\n\nLater during January 2013, Solis confirmed her interest in , saying \"I'm going to take a look at it.\"  In explaining why a former U.S. Representative and Cabinet member would be interested in a county-level body, analysts stated that the board is the most powerful county-level legislative body in the United States, and exercises some executive and quasi-judicial powers as well.  It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department's and its $26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state. Each member presiding over some two million constituents, three times that of Solis' old congressional district, and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics, after governor, U.S. Senator, and mayor of Los Angeles.  The supervisors have long been nicknamed \"the five little kings\".\n\nIn November 2013, Solis became a scholar-in-residence at her ''alma mater'' of .  Her duties were to include  guest lecturing in classes, mentoring students, and assisting in curriculum development, with a focus in political science.\n\n in 2014]]\n\nOn April 5, 2014, Solis formally announced the start of her campaign for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat, with the election to be held on June 3.  By this time she had raised over $600,000 for her effort and was considered the favorite to win the contest.  News of the federal investigation had little effect on her campaign.  Solis won the seat on June 4, 2014, garnering 70&nbsp;percent of the vote against two other opponents.  The margin meant she won the seat outright and would not need to run in a runoff election.\n\nAs Supervisor for District 1, she was at the forefront of the response to the  issue, which affected  and several other communities within her purview and which touched upon her past concerns with environmental justice.  The Supervisors allocated some county money for cleanup, with Solis saying, \"the state continues to drag its feet\". Going to the state capitol and asking for additional funds to remedy the situation, she said, \"This has gone on too long.\" In February 2016 she praised Governor  for finally increasing state funds for the cleanup, saying \"Our voices were heard. For too long we have seen two Americas: one in which affluent neighborhoods get immediate help and relief. The other America is made up of poor working-class families who silently suffer. Today's announcement from the governor reconciles these two Americas.\"\n\nAmong the other areas Solis was responsible for was . There she said her main priority was dealing with  and the lack of . By 2017, data showed that, under her tenure, the homeless rate had gone up by 48 percent in her district, with a 36 percent increase in the San Gabriel Valley itself.  The increase was attributed by officials familiar with the problem to constantly increasing housing costs combined with flat incomes.  Solis said in response, \"With increasingly out-of-control rents, we need more tools to secure housing stability for the most vulnerable County residents.\"\n\n\n\nRegarding the new job as a whole, Solis said, \"It's fascinating how many people work for the county – over 100,000. At the Department of Labor it was like 15,000. The budget here is $26 billion, much more than what I was used to in D.C.\"  In December 2015 Solis took over as , a position which is rotated on a yearly basis. She said a priority for 2016 would be \"to reaffirm our commitment to our diverse county family – to make this family, our family, inclusive for everybody, no matter their background, no matter where they come from, no matter how far down the scale they have been.\"  One of her efforts went towards getting additional resources for older children who were transitioning out of the  system.\n\nFollowing the results of the  and the fear of mass deportations that ensued due to the victor, Solis worked together with Los Angeles Mayor  to create the $10 million  L.A. Justice Fund, which would provide legal services to illegal immigrants facing deportation.\n\nIn May 2017, Solis voted in favor of retaining designation of the , created in 2014 but under review, along with other recently created national monuments, by new U.S. Secretary of the Interior  for possible revocation.  Solis also favored a  to increase the number of parks and playgrounds in Los Angeles.  In October 2017 a motion that she authored passed the board and resulted in  being replaced as an official holiday in Los Angeles County by .  She said in a statement, \"This action is about publicly recognizing that America's ancestors, for centuries, oppressed certain minority groups. This is not about erasing history; I believe the full history and impact of Christopher Columbus should be taught to current and future generations. While we cannot change the past, we can realize the pain that millions suffered throughout our nation's history, as well as the tremendous achievements of the original inhabitants of our continent.\"\n\n rally in protest of the White House's  ]]\n\nIn January 2018, Solis and the other supervisors supported the appointment of Nicole Tinkham as interim public defender, despite a letter signed by 390 public defenders who were concerned that Tinkham lacked criminal law experience and the potential for a conflict of interest, given Tinkham's prior representation of the .\n\nIn the , Solis ran unopposed, and was accordingly re-elected on June 5, 2018.   A lack of serious opposition, or any opposition at all, is not unusual for incumbent Supervisors.\n\nIn 2019, Solis, with fellow supervisor , was a leader of the successful effort to stop a planned $1.7&nbsp;billion mental health treatment center in the downtown area, intended to replace .  Solis and others argued that the new facility would become a de facto jail and instead urged the creation of smaller treatment facilities spread around the county.  Solis said in reference to contractors for any such project, \"I don't want to see people who are just used to building brick and mortar. I want to see people who have a humanistic approach.\"\nDuring the year, Solis also became an active supporter for , saying that the former vice president, whom she dealt with during her time as Secretary of Labor, had the necessary \"steady hand and experience\" and who also is \"personable\" and can interact well with a wide range of people.\n\n\n\nThe year 2020 was marked by the , and Solis and the other supervisors consistently urged residents to .  However some county employees in the districts of Solis and another supervisor complained that they were being compelled to report to unsafe offices instead of being allowed to work remotely.  Solis said that the services provided by some positions could only be done in person, but following newspaper inquiries on the matter, remote work was opened up to more county workers.  In December 2020, Solis became  again, and by then the entire board was women, a first for the county and something that Solis said was a historic accomplishment.  As the  reached an especially high peak towards the end of the year, Solis pleaded with county residents to stay home: \"As we near Christmas, I urge everyone to cancel their holiday plans to gather with members outside of one's households. This will save many lives.\"\n\nThe pandemic subsequently ebbed for a while, but then by mid-2021 the highly infectious  had become a significant threat, and in July 2021 Solis issued an executive order reimposing an indoors mask mandate within the county.  By this point  was well underway but also increasingly the subject of political disputes.  Saying that \"As vaccinations continue at a pace slower than what is necessary to slow the spread, the need for immediate action is great,\" Solis issued a mandate in August 2021 that county employees, who numbered over a hundred thousand, be vaccinated by October 1.  Her action gave no option for regular testing and thus went further than most such mandates elsewhere in California and the rest of the country.\n\nIn 2022, Solis signed a letter, along with her four supervisorial colleagues, to California Gov. Gavin Newsom requesting the phase out of the dangerous chemical Modified Hydrofluoric Acid (liable to cause a mass-casualty event in the case of a breach of its containment unit) at refineries where it remains in use rather than a safer alternative.\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, in 2000, Solis was given the  by the .\n\nIn 2010, Solis received the inaugural Robert P. Biller Award for Exemplary Public Service from the University of Southern California's . The Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities named Solis as the recipient of its 2011 President's Award for Excellence. In  2012, Solis received the Champion for the Futures of Farmworker Children Award from the  Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs.

Maltester was born in 1913 in San Leandro, California and was of Irish and Northern Italian descent.\n\nMaltester was appointed to the San Leandro City Council in 1948, to replace Helen Lawrence when she was selected mayor of that city by the City Council. Lawrence became Maltester's mentor in city government. Maltester served until the election of April, when he lost his seat. In 1956, Maltester was elected to the City Council, and then selected to be vice mayor by the City Council. In 1958, he was selected to be mayor by the City Council.\n\nIn 1962, Maltester became the first Mayor of San Leandro to be elected by popular ballot. He was re-elected three times, in 1966, 1970 and 1974.\n\nIn 1963, responding to the national , Maltester proposed a Committee on Human Rights and Responsibilities.

My city, a small city in California with less than 70,000 people, proposed this resolution and it is supported by the citizens of the community. It is not a resolution of condemnation. It is not offered in rancor. It is a positive statement of principle. To support this position, I believe, is an obligation none of us can ignore in the name of humanity. I ask your vote for an end to this war.\n\n\nThe resolution was adopted by the body of mayors after vigorous debate that included speeches by conference guest speakers  and .  Mayor  and  Mayor , whom Maltester greatly admired, were among those who voted for the resolution.\n\nIn 1972, Maltester was a prominent member of , supporting President Nixon's re-election campaign, saying the president was doing \"a tremendous job of building a country that is moving toward a peaceful prosperity.\"\n\nIn 1973, , who represented the district including San Leandro in the , was struck and killed by an automobile while jogging in .

He is a former shop steward for  (SEIU) Local 790.\n\n\nAfter his house burned down in April, 2000, Mar was ineligible to run for supervisor in District 1 as he had planned.

Several board members, including Ackerman, objected to the resolution, claiming that it was partisan and enabled students to skip school. A similar proposal calling for a day of on campus discussion regarding the war in Iraq was later passed.\n\nMar was criticized by the ''Richmond Review'' for allowing local school children to be bussed across the city rather than to attend school in their neighborhoods like Mar's own child.\n\n\nThe ''San Francisco Chronicle'' blamed Mar and two other Board of Education members for the tense relationship the Board had with former Superintendent :\n \nWhat (Ackerman) doesn't need is sniping and second-guessing from elected officials whose job is to set broad policies, not micromanage the superintendent's daily conduct. Tensions between school board members and superintendents come with the territory. But in San Francisco, those tensions had gone far beyond the limits of acceptability. Three board members in particular&mdash;Eric Mar, Sarah Lipson and Mark Sanchez&mdash;need to start working with Ackerman, not fighting with her virtually on a daily basis.\n\n''Beyond Chron'', however, had a different opinion, placing blame instead with Ackerman: At a September 2003 meeting of the Board of Education, Mar was among \"three board members with whom Ackerman has locked horns said they remain steadfast in their objections to her management of the district, which they characterize as autocratic and unyielding to differing views.\"\n\t\nThe Examiner and Chronicle were supportive of Arlene Ackerman.

The police department criticized the resolution and former police chief Tony Ribera urged the supervisors to allow the case to go to trial. The San Francisco Chronicle opined that the legislation conflicted with the judicial process and that any wrongdoing would be revealed in court.\n\nMar was the chief supporter of a law to ban restaurants from providing toys to customers unless the meals served were nutritious (i.e., reduced sugar, fat and sodium content and included fruits and vegetables). Mar said the measure was intended to be an incentive for restaurants to offer healthier meal choices.

Mar also directed the Budget and Legislative Analyst Office to identify potential opportunities to increase funding for bicycle infrastructure. In his last week in office, Mar succeeded in passing a plan for bus rapid transit on Geary Boulevard.\n\nIn July 2012, Mar introduced new regulations on chain stores to give neighborhoods more say about who can occupy retail space. The proposal expanded the definition of chain stores, or \"formula retail\", to include international chains and stores that are at least 50% owned by chains. The policy would also increase public notification standards and require applicants to prepare economic impact reports that measure the potential impact on surrounding stores.\n\nMar was criticized for complaining about , the five-year-old  sufferer named Miles Scott, who was sent by the  to \"rescue\" San Francisco. Mar wrote on : \"Waiting for Miles the Batkid and wondering how many 1000s of SF kids living off SNAP/FoodStamps could have been fed from the $$.\"\n For his complaint,  named Mar the \"Jerk of the Week.\" \"San Francisco city supervisor Eric Mar seems to have missed the heartwarming lesson behind the day, and instead decided to politicize the event,\" the publication wrote.

During his six years in the Assembly, he chaired the Rules Committee and helped found the Moderate Democratic Caucus.\n\nCardoza represented California's 18th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. The seat was previously held by Gary Condit. When Cardoza was starting out in politics, he served as Condit's Chief of Staff while Condit was still in the California Assembly. When Condit's career came under a cloud because of his extramarital affair with murdered intern , Cardoza ran against him in the 2002 Democratic  and won. Cardoza then faced Republican   in the November election. This race was considered to be the only potentially competitive House contest in California;  gave most of the state's 53 congresspersons safe districts. However, the Democratic-controlled state legislature had been concerned about a growing Republican trend in the 18th even before Condit's career imploded. The district and its predecessors had been in Democratic hands since 1955 and remained that way until the election of Republican  to Congress in 2022. The legislature shifted a Republican-leaning portion of eastern  to the heavily Republican 19th District. They replaced it with a mostly Democratic spur in and around Stockton, which gave the district a plurality of Latino voters. Cardoza defeated Monteith, 51 percent to 43 percent. He was reelected four times against only nominal opposition.\n\nCardoza was considered a  by California standards, which is typical for Democrats from the Central Valley. However, his voting record was slightly more liberal than that of Condit. During the , Cardoza was a co-chair of the , a group of moderate to  House Democrats of which Condit was a founding member. He was a member of the Resources Committee, Agriculture Committee, and International Relations Committee.\n\nFor the 112th Congress, Cardoza sat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, as well as the Agriculture Committee where he was ranking member of the Livestock, Dairy and Poultry Subcommittee. He remained a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, but his co-chairmanship was assumed by Congressman .\n\nMedia accounts suggest that Cardoza's decision to retire stemmed from the 2012 redistricting map, which put his hometown of  in the same district as fellow Blue Dog .

He was a native of Monterey County.\n\nWarren Church has been acknowledged as the father of the Monterey County parks system.\n\n\nWarren Church was born in northern Monterey County and spent all his life in the county, graduating from  in 1947. He was a high school athlete as well as being active with both student government and the school newspaper. At the age of 15, Church worked in the stock room of the King City  department store. He graduated from  in 1962, earning a bachelor's degree in social sciences and a Master of Arts Degree in education-social sciences. He also received both elementary and secondary teaching credentials. He was also on the staff of the college newspaper, \"''El Mustang''.\" In 1974, Church was awarded the Honored Alumni Award by Cal Poly University's alumni association. \n\nChurch served in the  and served with the 987th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and was wounded while serving, receiving a . He was eventually discharged as a Corporal on April 17, 1953.\n\nChurch taught at the  and the Jefferson school in . \n\n\nBefore the 1964 Monterey County Board of Supervisors primary, Church, Allmond and incumbent Chester Deaver were split over their positions on the incorporation of North Monterey County,  and . Church opposed the incorporation of North Monterey County, calling it an \"'extremely poor, short sighted and senseless reason,'\" but felt that Castroville was ready. Allmond called the incorporation of Castroville a \"'stab in the back'\" but later changed to asking for more input from the Castroville people. Deaver wanted to take a \"'wait and see' attitude.\"\n\nIn the June 1964 primary, Chester Deaver had finished far in front of his challengers; Deaver 2,927, Church 1,374, Allmond 1,116, Simon 938, Bayer 650, Coffill 391 (unofficial results). However, the runoff of the top two candidates led to the election of Church to the Monterey County Board of Supervisors November 3, 1964. Church defeated incumbent Deaver, \"with a 1,066 vote margin\". At the time, ''The supervisor position was part-time and came with a typewriter and $300 a month for incidentals''.\n\nThe 1968 election results were Church 5,555 to Simon 2,859.\n\nIn 1972, the '''' endorsed Church for Supervisor, while saying that they have disagreed with him many times and probably will continue to do so as \"the interests of the city of  seen to be a fairly low priority item with him... Nevertheless,... he is head and shoulders above his opponents.\" Church won reelection for his third term June 6, 1972. He won with 53% of the vote.  His challengers were Jack Simon and Andrew Hollenstain.\n\n\n\nIn 1972 Church was invited to a Salinas Board of Realtors meeting to discuss campaign issues in a private setting. Church declined stating:\n\n}}\n\nIn November 1972, the Board heard arguments for relaxing zoning ordinances for mobile homes in North Monterey County. Arguments for relaxing were due to very high home prices that made owning a home in the county difficult. Arguments against were that mobile homeowners used the county services equally as a homeowner but paid lower taxes. There was also a concern about a reduction of lot sizes, allowing the county to double in population since 1963 when 11,000 residents lived in the unincorporated area of North County (excluding Castroville). According to the North County Rezoning Study which looked at 48,700 acres and an existing density of 11.3 acres per unit, proposed developments could increase the population from 16,000 (from 1970 census) to 338,900 with a density of .51 acres per unit. Appearance of mobile homes, fire safety, and environmental concerns were also a consideration. Church stated that all attendees at the meeting that approved of the ban lived in North Monterey County, and those arguing about the ban were people who lived outside the area and had a financial interest. One  resident, Art Woodfin, complained about the ban stating that he \"had an option on 15 acres of land in North County and planned to put mobile homes on it.\" Church replied, \"'Then you're coming to rape the North County?'\"\n\nThe ''Salinas Californian'' stated in 1975 that although the ''Californian'' has criticized Church, \"he's given us about as good as he's got in rebuttal... its hard not to admire the man's independence.\" There was a serious recall effort for Church's seat in 1974 which failed. Despite losing several elections, \"Defeat doesn't discourage him... Church doesn't scare worth a darn.\" In August 1975, Church announced that he would not seek re-election to the Board of Supervisors saying, \"'12 years is as long as anyone should consecutively hold any one elective or appointive position... New ideas are necessary for proper functioning of government.'\" He hinted that he might run for the State Senate seat that was being vacated by Republican Donald Grunsky.\n\nChurch had a perfect meeting attendance record. In the 12 years of Church's tenure, he did not miss a single board meeting. Church remembers at his farewell Supervisor meeting that he \"attended 558 consecutive regular board meetings and 100 or more special meetings.\" Reflecting on needs of the county for his successor, Church said that \"growth and property taxes... the two major problems facing Monterey County... prohibit general use of the property tax and adopt low density zoning... we don't have to become South San Jose.\" Further about his tenure with the Board, Church reflected, \"I see no basis to bring suit against the county, except perhaps for the amount and color of my hair.\" County Supervisor and future Congressman  in 1976, said of his colleague Church, \"'I think this board has really been one of the outstanding supervisorial boards in California ... whose 12 years of experience and insight have taught me a lot. I think that serving in public office is really a leveling experience. I think I've learned that from my colleague on the left (Poyner) and Mr. Church.'\"\n\n\n\n\nChurch was instrumental in the acquisition and development of the Monterey County Parks system.}} When running for the board position in 1964 his \"main plank was a county park system.\" Prior to 1966, Monterey County did not have a parks department, and was one of the last counties in California to have one. There had been interest in 1944 when the county made a parks plan, but nothing happened. Church blames a '\"conservative viewpoint that didn't push for public services.'\" for the reason it took until 1966 to give Monterey County its first public park, . He spearheaded the purchase of a former turkey ranch, for Royal Oaks Park ($122,000 – it was $1,000 an acre), which opened on Labor Day in 1966 and also saw establishment of the Monterey County Parks Department that same year. His tenure on the Board of Supervisors also saw the creation of a number of other parks including Manzanita Park near , Toro Park in Salinas,  in Monterey and San Lorenzo Park near .\n\nAt the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Monterey County Parks Department, Republican Charmaine Cruchett thanked Church and said, \"The little fox I recently saw dashing across Castroville Boulevard into Manzanita Park may not know who provided that haven, but certainly all North Countians should. I thank you Warren. My children thank you. And if we're lucky, our human progeny can share your parks progeny forever.\" The county administrative office released a memorandum October 2, 2006, at the 40th anniversary of the Parks Department saying, \"The highlight of the event was the attendance of Warren Church... who was instrumental in establishing the Parks Department and Charter Park Commissioners, from 1966.\" In 1977 Church said he had tried to protect\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1975 Church pointed out that there is a relationship between growth and property taxes leading to agricultural land being sold for development. This drives the need for services and thus higher taxes. One outcome was the passage in 1976 of a Board of Supervisors resolution to establish \"growth guidelines to protect the character of the county.\" Church felt that rather than using property taxes to support county governments, a percentage of federal or state income tax could be set aside.\n\nChurch was a strong supporter of local control and access to the court system and he long resisted the eventual consolidation of Monterey County courts, largely in service to the interests of his constituents.\n\nAt the end of his tenure, the ''Californian'' stated that Church was a strong supporter of the library system and initiated the first family planning program in Monterey County.\n\nChurch was also a founder of Post 593 of the  .\n\n\n\nChurch was a key vote on a controversial 1965 project promoted by , a subsidiary of  of New Jersey, that would have changed the Monterey Bay's look and feel. Humble was intended to kickstart a massive 60-square-mile development plan for the Moss Landing area that would have significantly impacted the area's natural beauty and altered its economic development. The company wanted to build a 50,000-barrel-a-day refinery with plans to expand to 150,000–200,000 barrels-a-day on a 444 acre site on the wetlands near  at the . Monterey County was deeply divided on the plan with tourism proponents, some agricultural interests and a nascent environmental movement opposing the refinery. However, public opinion surveys showed greater than 2 to 1 support for the Humble Oil refinery with Church's supervisorial district in favor with 82%. The Board of Supervisors, after a 17-hour marathon public meeting, voted 3–2 to back the plan, with Church in favor of it because his district overwhelmingly backed the plan. But Church and others added many tough restrictions to the project a few weeks later at a 12-hour meeting that set the conditions for the permit. \"It is not just the Humble Oil refinery we are fighting at Moss Landing,\" said  photographer  prior to the decision. \"It is the whole industrial complex which will inevitability follow and change the whole complexion of this Monterey County.\"\n\nThe Humble project was approved, but the planning commission (which had previously rejected the project by a 5–4 vote) had imposed 36 conditions many that had never been imposed on an industry before. Church added three more which included for parking,  recovery and  emissions. As a part of the imposed conditions on the approval for Humble Oil, Church asked that three air-pollution stations be set up in Monterey County to monitor air quality for two-years prior to Humble starting to build. Church said that the county needed to do so in order to \"obtain 'guidelines' to determine what pollutants an oil refinery may contribute.\" Church's intentions were that Humble be required to pay for and maintain the stations. '''' stated, \"It is conceivable in the future that other areas debating the admittance of an oil refinery will look at Monterey County as an example of strict regulations. The conditions are that unique.\" One of the most restrictive conditions forbid Humble Oil from expanding significantly without getting a new permit.\n\nBy the spring of 1966, Humble Oil was expressing the need for a larger refinery than initially permitted. Church publicly declared that there was not a majority on the Board of Supervisors for a larger refinery. Although not identifying himself as the supervisor switching his position on Humble, it is widely accepted that it was Church who refused to back a larger refinery unless Humble could \"prove\" that a smaller one would comply with the county's restrictions. On May 18, 1966, Humble Oil announced a suspension of all activities at Moss Landing, publicly stating that a prime reason for abandoning the site was the difficulty of achieving a permit for a larger refinery. Public outcry and a legal challenge plus engineering problems also discouraged Humble Oil, and they eventually pulled out of Monterey County and decided to build a bigger refinery up north in more-welcoming .\n\nIn 1979, Church would become a founding member of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, which eventually helped create the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, which would have been devastated by Humble Oil's refinery and future industrial development. After Humble Oil's departure, no major industry seriously proposed to build at Moss Landing. In 1992, the  was established.\n\n\nChurch served on several civic and government boards, including:\n*California Central Coast Regional Water Control Board \n*Vice President Monterey County Board of Education – Served April 16, 1963, to November 12, 1964\n*Monterey-Santa Cruz County Unified Air Pollution Control District – District Board of Directors from 1968 to 1975.\n*San Felipe Committee (California Central Coast Water Importation) \n*Special Tax Committees of the County Supervisors Association of California\n*Local Applications Advisory Board, created in 1965 to \"approve applications for migrant housing, education and health care\". Church was succeeded by John Ventura, Fresno County Supervisor in 1967.\n\n\n\n\nChurch had a number of business ventures, including  in high school and college, nursery supply and . He has grown Christmas trees in properties in Hidden Valley, at Omo Ranch, CA., Egremont, Ma., and Wadena, Mn.\n\n\nChurch died September 2, 2017, at age 87.

Before serving in the state assembly, he was a member of the , and the city's first Commissioner on Homelessness.\n\n\nMaienschein graduated from the  in 1991 with a bachelor of arts degree in communications. He returned to San Diego to attend . He clerked for Judge Norbert Ehrenfreud focusing on the mental health calendar in San Diego. Maienschein also teaches a course on Election Law at USD School of Law.\n\n\nAfter passing the bar, Maienschein worked as a business attorney in private practice and became actively engaged with the community. Maienschein helped develop San Diego's Community Youth Court, bringing together community service agencies, schools, and law enforcement to provide intervention and help first-time juvenile offenders. Maienschein served as the Community Youth Court's Executive Director and received the District Attorney's Crime Victims' Rights Award in 1999. The program has since been transitioned into the San Diego Youth Commission. This program is made up of appointees aged 14 to 22 who meet to confer on issues relating to youth in San Diego County, and report their findings and recommendations to the Mayor.\n\nAt age 29, Maienschein decided to run for San Diego City Council. In preparation for his campaign, Maienschein walked each precinct of District 5 twice, knocking on doors and engaging with constituents.\n\n\nMaienschein was elected to the San Diego City Council in November 2000 with 63% of the vote, the most ever received by a non-incumbent, and was re-elected without opposition in 2004.\n\nDuring his two terms on the City Council, Brian secured the opening of State Route 56 and led numerous infrastructure improvements throughout the City of San Diego. He also preserved over 11,000 acres in the San Pasqual Valley from development.\n\nIn 2003 and 2007, wildfires swept through the district, devastating homes and businesses. Maienschein walked the burned-out neighborhood streets himself before constituents were allowed to return, developing a list of homes and businesses that had been destroyed. In response to the fires, Maienschein created a one-stop disaster hub for victims to support and streamline rebuilding efforts, bringing together the all the government agencies and services for those impacted by fires. The plan and programs Maienschein created are still national models for disaster response.\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, the United Way appointed Maienschein as San Diego's first \"Commissioner of the Plan to End Chronic Homelessness\" (also called the Homelessness Commissioner). In that role, Maienschein created Project 25, an innovative pilot program for people experiencing homelessness coupling permanent housing with intensive individualized support, including a medical home. The program's mission was to show how housing and medical care, when delivered in concert, could improve health and housing outcomes for vulnerable people while reducing costs.\n\nLeading both the fundraising and coordination efforts, Maienschein worked with more than 20 organizations including the United Way, St. Vincent de Paul, the San Diego Housing Commission, the County of San Diego, the City of San Diego, and area hospitals, among others.\n\nProject 25 launched in 2011, serving 35 individuals experiencing homelessness who had been identified as the most frequent users of public services, including emergency rooms, hospitals, jails, and ambulances. Before the end of the program's first year, all 35 individuals in the program were housed in apartments and were receiving comprehensive wrap-around services.\n\nA 2015 study by the Fermanian Business & Economic Institute at Point Loma Nazarene University summarized the program's outcomes. \"The results are impressive … In addition to significant decreases in public costs and service utilization, Project 25 also helped people become more independent, including helping them secure their own income.\"\n\nTwo years after the conclusion of the pilot in 2015, all Project 25 participants were still participating in the program and were housed in their own apartments, had acquired health care insurance, and were receiving health care on an ongoing basis.\n\n\nIn 2011, Maienschein announced he would run for the 77th District seat in the California State Assembly. He was elected on November 6, 2012, with more than 60% of the vote, and was sworn in on December 3, 2012. Maienschein served as Vice Chair of both the Health and Human Services Committees. In addition, Maienschein served on the Housing, Judiciary, and Business, Professions, and Consumer Protection Committees.\n\nMaienschein was reelected in 2014, winning more than 65% in the primary election and then 70% of the vote in the general election on November 4, 2014. In 2015, Maienschein was named the Chair of the Assembly Local Government Committee – the only Republican appointed to lead a committee in the California legislature. In addition to chairing the Local Government Committee, Maienschein served again as vice-chair of the Health and Human Services Committees, as well as serving on the Housing, Judiciary and Business, Professions and Consumer Protection Committees. After the term, Maienschein had 25 bills signed into law – the most bills amongst the San Diego delegation.\n\nIn 2016, Maienschein was re-elected to his third term in the California State Assembly. During the two-year term, Maienschein served as vice-chair of the Health Committee and served on the Housing and Community Development, Judiciary, and Government Organization Committees. This year, Maienschein was the lead Republican negotiator in renewing the Managed Care Organization (MCO) tax, which helped save Medi-Cal.\n\nMaienschein was re-elected on November 6, 2018, by 607 votes. On January 24, 2019, Maienschein announced he switched his political party affiliation to the Democratic party. Maienschein penned an op-ed in the San Diego Union-Tribune explaining the switch.\n\nMaienschein was reelected to the California State Assembly on November 3, 2020. He was narrowly reelected in 2022. He serves on the Communications and Conveyance, Health, Judiciary, and Rules Committees.\n\nThe California state legislature allows members to serve a maximum of 12 years. As such, Maienschein cannot run again in 2024.\n\n\nMaienschein ran an unsuccessful campaign for San Diego City Attorney in 2024. He lost to Chief Deputy City Attorney Heather Ferbert.\n\n\nMaienschein has been a strong advocate for child safety laws. In 2014, Maienschein passed AB 230, which requires youth sports leagues to disclose their background check policies to parents and whether or not they include federal and state-level criminal histories.\n\nAssembly District 77 has a large Navy population, and Maienschein has made it a priority to advocate for the families of active and retired service members. In 2013, Maienschein introduced AB 186, which made it easier for military spouses to obtain a temporary professional or vocational license, allowing them to find work and support their families while stationed in California.\n\nIn 2018, Maienschein's AB 2193 was signed into law, requiring obstetric providers including OB/GYNs, family practice providers, and nurse practitioners to either confirm screening has occurred or screen for maternal mental health disorders at least once during the perinatal period. AB 2193 also requires health plans and health insurers to create programs to address these maternal mental health disorders.\n\nAlso in 2018, Maienschein took action to expand protections against human trafficking. AB 2105 allows courts to triple any fine, add a civil penalty, or damage award regarding the purchase of sex from a minor.\n\nMaienschein addressed California's housing crisis in 2019 by authoring AB 960. This bill allows CalWORKS recipients to use housing assistance vouchers in a shared housing setting, such as staying with family and friends, rather than solely at motels and hotels.\n\nIn 2019, the community of Poway was devastated by the , which injured 3 and killed 1. Maienschein responded to this tragedy by authoring AB 1548. This bill established a grant program for nonprofits at high risk of terrorist attacks to access funding for security.\n\nIn 2020, Maienschein authored AB 856, which helps active military service members and their families access a broader range of community college courses offered on military bases by waiving open course provisions.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, the community of  was proposed as the placement for a sexually violent predator (SVP). In joining the community in opposition to the placement, Maienschein found various flaws in the law regarding where an SVP can be placed. In response, Maienschein introduced AB 1641 in 2022, which placed restrictions on where an SVP can be housed in a community. However, the bill was heavily amended before passage, and the final version only required GPS monitoring of sexually violent predators until they are legally discharged.\n\nAs of 2021, Maienschein has authored 107 bills into law.\n\n\nMaienschein lives in San Diego with his wife, Elly, and daughters, Taylin and Brenna. He also teaches election law at the .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| percentage = 100.0\n}}\n\n\n\n\n| percentage = 100.0\n}}\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She served in this role from December 12, 2017, to January 23, 2018.\n\nBreed won the  held on June 5, 2018. Breed is the first black woman, second black person after , and second woman after  to be elected mayor of San Francisco. She was sworn in as mayor on July 11, 2018. During her tenure as mayor, she has been a proponent of increasing housing supply in San Francisco amid a , frequently butting heads with anti-housing members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nShe ran for re-election as mayor in 2024, but lost to .\n\n\nBorn in San Francisco, Breed was raised by her grandmother in Plaza East public housing in the  neighborhood of the city. As a youth, Breed lived with three siblings (two brothers and a sister), along with an aunt who was facing mental health challenges. Breed later wrote of her childhood in San Francisco, \"five of us living on $900 per month. 'Recycling' meant drinking out of old mayonnaise jars. Violence was never far away. And once a week, we took Grandma's pushcart to the community room to collect government-issued groceries.\" Her younger sister died of a drug overdose in 2006. Her brother, Napoleon Brown, is in prison serving a 44-year sentence for a 2000 conviction on charges of manslaughter and armed robbery, for which Breed has repeatedly asked for clemency from the governor's office. Breed has stated that her brother's early release from prison would be \"what's best for both Napoleon and society overall\".\n\nAt age 14, Breed worked as a paid intern at The Family School as part of the Mayor's Youth Employment and Training Program. She graduated with honors from  where she played in the band and participated in school government. Although she entered college as a chemistry major, she earned a bachelor's degree in political science–public service from the  in 1997 and a master's degree in public administration from the  in 2012. While in college, Breed babysat and cleaned houses to help pay for expenses. After college graduation, she said that \"I just didn't want to be poor,\" especially witnessing her grandmother's financial struggles.\n\n\nBreed worked as an  in the Office of Housing and Neighborhood Services for Mayor . In 2002, she became the executive director of the African American Art & Culture Complex, where she raised over $2.5 million to renovate the complex's 34,000 square foot space, including an art gallery, theater space, and a recording studio. Breed was named to the  Commission in 2004. In 2010, Mayor  appointed her to the San Francisco Fire Commission.\n\n\n\nIn November 2012, Breed was elected to the District 5 supervisor seat, defeating incumbent , who had been appointed to the seat that year by Mayor  after Supervisor  was elected sheriff. Following five rounds of ranked-choice voting allocations, Breed won by over 12 points, marking the first time in San Francisco history that a challenger unseated a district supervisor. (The feat has occurred four times since, with  unseating Supervisor  in 2015 to reclaim his District 3 seat,  beating Supervisor  in District 8 in June 2018,  defeating Breed's own appointed replacement Supervisor  in District 5 in 2019, and  defeating Supervisor  in District 4 in 2022.)\n\nDuring her first few months as Supervisor in 2013, Breed persuaded city departments to complete two new bike lanes on Oak and Fell Streets ahead of schedule, prompting the local transportation site StreetsblogSF to say she had “emerged as a bicycling champion.” She secured federal funding for the redesign of Masonic Boulevard in her district, which added bike lanes and traffic safety measures to one of the most dangerous corridors in the city. The official ribbon-cutting for the completed Masonic Avenue Streetscape Improvement Project between Geary Boulevard and the Panhandle took place in August 2018. The project cost $25 million. The bicycle improvements were limited to a buffered bike lane, which typically cost $15,000 per mile.\n\nBreed was inaugurated as District 5 supervisor on January 8, 2013, with then–  administering the oath of office. On January 8, 2015, Breed was elected President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors first by a vote of 8 to 3 and then unanimously. She defeated supervisor , who was also nominated for the position. Breed succeeded District Four Supervisor , who assumed the presidency temporarily after then-Board President  resigned to begin serving in the California Assembly.\n\nBreed cosponsored 2014's Proposition A, a $500 million bond to fund street repaving, infrastructure repair, transit service improvements, and increased bicycle and pedestrian safety. It passed with 72% support. She was also the deciding vote to place 2014's Proposition B on the ballot, which required transportation funding to be increased with population growth. It passed with 61% support and now provides approximately $25 million per year for transit, bike, and pedestrian improvements. When Kezar Drive, a major thoroughfare in her district, fell into disrepair, Breed addressed what she called a \"case study in bureaucracy\" between the  and  and got the road repaved.\n\nIn 2015, Breed helped pass \"neighborhood preference\" legislation to prioritize neighborhood residents for the affordable homes built in their community. When the federal Department of  threatened to block the legislation, she flew to Washington, D.C., with a delegation of San Francisco officials and persuaded it to let the program proceed. The program first went into effect for the Willie B. Kennedy apartments in Breed's district, with 39 units prioritized for community residents at risk of economic displacement.\n\nSan Francisco passed legislation in 2015 to create the Neighborhood Commercial Transit District in the Divisadero and Fillmore corridors in her district. The laws removed housing density caps, allowing more homes to be built on a given parcel without increasing the building's size or height. The Affordable Divis group requested that Breed rescind the law, citing concerns about the availability of affordable units and lack of community input. She declined, citing the need for more homes in the city and conflicts with Proposition C from 2012.\n\nIn April 2015, the city of San Francisco passed legislation to remove minimum parking space requirements for new buildings and allow unused parking spaces in existing buildings to be converted housing.\n\nThe 's response times to emergency medical calls spiked dramatically in 2014, with ambulances often unavailable to respond. Breed was outspoken in demanding improvements, pushing then-Mayor Lee to do more, expressing a lack of confidence in Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White, and generating press attention for the issue. Breed fought for substantially more funding for emergency medical services, ultimately succeeding in getting $47.3 million invested to hire EMTs, paramedics, firefighters, and 911 dispatchers, as well as buy new ambulances and fire trucks, and improve  facilities. Breed has cited her work on this issue as helping to reduce ambulance response times by over 26%. Her work also helped her earn the sole endorsement of the San Francisco Firefighters Local 798 union in the 2018 mayoral election.\n\nIn 2015, Breed worked with then-Mayor Ed Lee to help add 400 new police officers to the . After the shooting of  by San Francisco police officers on December 2, 2015, Breed and  passed a Resolution calling for a federal investigation of the shooting and a Department of Justice review of the 's use of force policies. This ultimately resulted in 272 recommendations to improve the SFPD.\n\nAs part of an FBI investigation into public corruption and bid-fixing primarily involving then-State Senator , businessman Derf Butler was recorded talking about allegedly paying for access to Breed. According to court documents released in 2015, Butler told an FBI source that he \"pays Supervisor Breed with untraceable debit cards for clothing and trips in exchange for advantages on contracts in San Francisco.\" The allegation was denied by Breed, who as a member of the Board of Supervisors had no role in contract selections, and no evidence has ever been presented to substantiate it.\n\nBreed was the lead sponsor and co-sponsor of two housing ballot measures: Proposition A in 2015, a $310 million bond for affordable housing which passed with 74% support, and Proposition C in 2016, a $261 million housing bond that repurposed unused city bond funds for affordable housing and passed with 77% support. Breed joined Supervisor  in supporting the 2018 \"Housing for All\" ballot measure, Proposition D, to increase the city's tax on commercial rents to \"raise about $100 million a year to pay for 10,000 low- and middle-income housing units and shelter accommodations for the city’s homeless population over the next decade.\" After facing a competing tax increase measure, Prop D did not pass.\n\nIn February 2016, Breed announced her reelection bid to represent District 5. The top issues she identified in her announcement were building and protecting affordable housing, increasing public safety, improving environmental health, and modernizing public transportation. , an attorney, ran against her. Breed won reelection 52% to 48% on November 8, 2016, beating Preston in 46 of the district's 68 precincts.\n\nIn 2017, Breed coauthored legislation to provide civil counsel for tenants facing eviction, reducing the chances of vulnerable tenants unfairly losing their homes. Voters approved a similar measure in June 2018, Proposition F.\n\nBreed was unanimously reelected to another two-year term as Board President on January 9, 2017. No other supervisors were nominated for the position.\n\n\nFollowing the death of Mayor  on December 12, 2017, Breed became the city's Acting Mayor by virtue of her position as President of the Board of Supervisors. She served in this position until January 23, 2018, when the Board of Supervisors selected  to serve as the interim \"caretaker\" mayor until a special election on June 5. Supervisors ,  (herself a candidate for Mayor), and others considered the  members of the board, sought to deny Breed the benefits of  going into the election and to maintain a  between the positions of mayor and board president, both of which Breed occupied at the time. Progressive Supervisor  delivered a speech accusing Breed of being supported by \"white, rich men\" and billionaires such as . Ronen's choice for interim mayor, , was a white male venture capitalist whose firm Conway had invested in.\n\nBreed ran in the  held on June 5. She led in the initial count's first-place votes with 35.6 percent, with  in second with 25.9 percent, and Kim with 22.8 percent. Leno took the lead early the next day after the initial tabulation of ranked-choice ballots, but Breed retook the lead on June 9. On June 13, with 9,000 ballots left to count, Leno conceded defeat and congratulated Breed on her victory. Breed resigned as president of the Board of Supervisors on June 26, 2018 and was succeeded by  in a unanimous vote by the Board. Breed retained her position as District 5 supervisor until assuming the mayoralty on July 11. Breed was elected to a full term in the  against five relatively unknown candidates.\n\nIn March 2019, Breed awarded a posthumous certificate of honor to  politician and former  member  for his \"courageous service in the military\". The nomination had been made by the United Irish Societies, who had appointed him honorary marshal in the . She apologized two days later following controversy over McGuinness's involvement with the IRA.\n\nOn March 7, 2019, Breed and several other  mayors endorsed  for president in the . Harris later dropped out of the race. On January 23, 2020, Breed endorsed  for president in the primaries.\n\nIn December 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that  would succeed Kamala Harris as  after she was elected to serve as Vice President of the United States. Breed and former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown expressed disappointment that the replacement for the seat was not an African American woman as Harris was the only African American woman serving in the Senate at the time.\n\nIn the 2024 US presidential election, Breed quickly endorsed Kamala Harris once  had dropped out.\n\nIn 2024, she ran for re-election in against a crowded field of candidates, including several moderate Democrats with similar policy positions to herself. She conceded the race to Daniel Lurie on November 7, 2024.\n\n\nIn July 2019, Breed signed an ordinance effectively banning the sale of  in San Francisco, both at brick-and-mortar stores and online to a San Francisco address.\n\nIn 2021, Breed announced a State of Emergency in the Tenderloin in order to more efficiently implement her Tenderloin Intervention Plan, which included conducting extensive community outreach, engaging in direct intervention on the “most destructive” problems facing the Tenderloin community, and finally, implementing sustained public safety and accessibility operations. After the 90-day State of Emergency concluded, ABC7 reported that significant progress had been made in the area, stating that “Eleven-thousand grams of fentanyl have been seized and ten percent of drug users who have come to get help have agreed to some kind of treatment or medical care.”\n\nIn late 2023, Breed announced the creation of a new Joint Task Force with SFPD, the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, the California Highway Patrol, and the California National Guard in order to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nOn September 26th, 2024, the San Francisco Examiner reported that San Francisco’s 2024 crime rate at its the lowest in 10 years, and that if the murder rate continued its current trend, the City was on track to see “the lowest number of reported homicides since 1960.” The drop in reported crime rates included a 14% drop in the rate of violent crime and a 34% drop in the rate of property crime as compared to the same period of 2023. \n\nIn order to combat a wave of retail thefts, Breed instituted a “Retail Theft Blitz.” In November of 2023, the Mayor’s office reported that the effort resulted in over three hundred arrests during 2023 alone. Breed also sponsored Proposition E, which San Francisco voters approved on March 5th, 2024 with a 9-point margin. This proposition authorized the San Francisco Police Department to utilize drones instead of or in addition to car chases, and allowed SFPD officers to engage in more efficient reporting practices. On August, 29th, 2024, the City reported that auto break-ins dropped 57% compared to the same period in 2023, thanks in part to the use of drones, automated license plate readers, and bait operations.\n\n\n\nMayor Breed is on record of supporting all housing, including affordable and market rate housing, and has stated she would veto any \"anti-housing\" legislation that crossed her desk. In 2019, Breed sponsored a $600M housing bond which voters approved by a 42% margin. Breed also created the “30x30 Plan,” which would bring 30,000 new residents to San Francisco by 2030. This will be accomplished by converting office buildings to residential and commercial, constructing new student housing, and working with state leaders to create incentives for businesses to move to or remain in San Francisco's downtown. To facilitate the conversion of office buildings to residential uses, Breed implemented the Commercial to Residential Adaptive Reuse Program, which streamlines the permitting and approval process to facilitate quicker construction of new housing. \n\nBreed sponsored Proposition C in San Francisco's March, 2024 primary election, which gives a transfer tax exemption the first time commercial properties are converted into residential uses. Proposition C passed with a 5% margin. Despite these new exemptions, according to the San Francisco Standard, current incentives are insufficient to facilitate new projects despite 13% of the City's office buildings being viable candidates for conversion. On September 26th, 2024, Mayor Breed and Supervisor Matt Dorsey (who represents much of Downtown and the Financial District) proposed legislation which would eliminate office to housing conversion fees. These fees typically account for $70,000-90,000 per unit in additional cost, according to the Mayor's office. \n\nBreed is a major advocate for modular housing, arguing that it can be built more quickly and cheaply than conventional construction, helping the city create more housing sooner. As Acting Mayor, she announced a partnership with labor unions to build a modular housing factory in or near San Francisco.\n\nAs Mayor, Breed aligned herself with pro-housing leaders like State Senator  and the SF YIMBY (Yes In My Back Yard) organization. Both Senator Wiener and SF YIMBY endorsed Breed's 2024 re-election campaign. In her inaugural address on July 11, 2018, Breed said: “The politics of ‘no’ has plagued our city for far too long‘not on my block, not in my backyard.’ We have made mistakes in the past by not moving housing production forward all over this city. I plan to change the politics of ‘no’ to the politics of ‘yes.’ Yes, we will build more housing.”\n\nBreed's Department of Planning has advanced a new zoning plan in San Francisco which would facilitate reaching the 82,000 unit goal. This plan  includes increasing density along certain corridors in San Francisco's western neighborhoods, such as the Sunset, Richmond, and Lakeside, which are predominantly made up of single family homes. Under the new zoning plan, height and density restrictions will remain in place in most of the Western portion of the city, except along transit corridors and certain corner lots.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, 72% of Muni riders rated Muni service as \"good\" or \"excellent,\" the highest rating since Muni began collecting public opinion information in 2001. As of 2023, San Francisco has over 75 miles of bus lanes, and the pace of bus lane rollout has increased dramatically under Breed. Breed's SFMTA has created several  routes, including the  corridor and the  corridor.\n\nBreed carried multiple pieces of legislation allowing  to purchase hundreds of new buses and replace its entire fleet of trains. Introduced over several years, her legislation provided for 50 hybrid buses, 260 light rail vehicles, 61 hybrid buses, 60 trolley buses, 98 hybrid buses, and 33 trolley buses. The 260 new light rail vehicles are slated to replace Muni's aging fleet of  trains, add 24 trains for the new , and provide 85 more trains for added service throughout the system. Built by  in , the new trains are lighter and quieter than the ones they replace and project to run almost 12 times longer before needing major repair. The first Siemens train went into service in San Francisco in 2017.\n\nBreed worked with the  and  and carried the legislation to add cellular service for riders on 's underground trains. The lack of cell service has been a long-standing complaint by riders.\n\n\n\nMayor London Breed has continued San Francisco’s commitment to Vision Zero, a pledge to eliminate injuries and deaths from road accidents. As of spring 2024, 72% of all bike lanes in San Francisco were built during Breed’s tenure as Mayor. In 2018, Breed requested the SFMTA Board of Directors expedite their project delivery process. In response, the Board passed a resolution that enables the agency to deliver “Quick Build” projects. These projects are focused along high-injury corridors and are designed to be reversible and cheaply implemented. As of Spring, 2024, the City has completed 39 Quick Build projects.\n\nIn an effort to create more outdoor community spaces during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Breed closed 1.5 miles of JFK Promenade to cars. She introduced legislation to the Board of Supervisors on April 28th, 2022, to ensure that JFK Promenade would remain a car-free community space. In November, 2023, San Francisco voters approved Proposition J with 63% of the vote, extending car-free JFK indefinitely. Due to JFK’s closure to cars, there is an uninterrupted car-free path from the Panhandle to Ocean Beach (4.6 miles). Breed also supports further efforts to create more pedestrian spaces around the city. In her 2024 Transportation Vision, she voiced support for banning cars along parts of Haight Street and in North Beach.\n\nBreed’s SFMTA also established the Slow Streets Program in 2020 in order to create a network of “safe, comfortable, low-vehicle-traffic routes” throughout San Francisco, to facilitate active modes of transportation such as biking and walking. The Slow Streets Program was an immediate success, with a 2021 SFMTA study finding that average vehicle speeds decreased by 14% and collisions decreased by 36%.\n\nUnder Breed, San Francisco has begun to install speed cameras. Until 2024, this was banned by state law, and San Francisco is one of five Californian cities to begin installing speed cameras, which have proven effective in reducing traffic speeds and fatalities in other cities.\n\n\nOn September 26, 2024, Breed announced that her administration is on track to increase San Francisco's shelter capacity by 90% by 2025, three years ahead of schedule. Since Breed became Mayor in 2018, the City has given shelter to nearly 10,000 individuals, and helped 5,250 people move into housing. As of 2024, San Francisco's street homelessness rate was at its lowest point in 10 years.\n\nBreed has made homelessness a focus in her administration. In October 2018, she announced plans to build 1,000 shelter beds by 2020. To help achieve this goal, she introduced legislation declaring a shelter crisis in San Francisco, which allows the city to waive certain permitting and contracting requirements for homeless services. She also has worked to expand mental health and substance abuse recovery beds. When the Controller found an extra $415 million in property taxes, Breed introduced legislation to fund housing and homelessness programs with the discretionary portion of the funding. She also authored legislation with Supervisor  to expand San Francisco's conservatorship laws, based on California Senate Bill 1045, authored by State Senator .\n\nAfter the   that municipalities can remove homeless encampments, Breed has advocated for and authorized sweeps of encampments. \n\nDuring Breed's tenure, San Francisco increased access to shelter and housing for the homeless. Due to these anti-homelessness efforts, San Francisco is the only Bay Area city that has a shrinking homelessness rate.\n\n\nSan Francisco issued a state of emergency because of  in February 2020, before the federal government suggested doing so, and San Francisco became one of the first American cities to go into lockdown. On March 2, Breed advised residents, \"Prepare for possible disruption from an outbreak\". Under the state of emergency, private gyms were required to shut down, but the city government petitioned  for a waiver to allow various government employees to continue to use gyms in city-owned facilities, which were allowed to continue to operate.\n\nOn April 24, 2020, Breed reported that her city's PPE orders had been diverted to other cities and countries. She said, \"We’ve had issues of our orders being relocated by our suppliers in China. For example, we had isolation gowns on their way to San Francisco and they were diverted to France. We’ve had situations when things we’ve ordered that have gone through  were confiscated by  to be diverted to other locations.\"\n\nIn November 2020, Breed attended an eight-person birthday party at the   in  during the . The event was held in a partially enclosed room, despite  discouraging such gatherings with a recommended three-household cap. Napa County allowed indoor dining at the time without a household cap. Still, Heather Knight of ''San Francisco Chronicle'' noted that the event violated San Francisco health guidelines at the time. San Francisco banned indoor dining three days later. Breed and other California politicians such as Governor Gavin Newsom and  Mayor  were criticized for not following the same public health guidelines they administered.\n\nDuring the pandemic, sidewalks and parking spaces were turned into outdoor dining spaces. In 2021, Breed called for allowing small businesses to use sidewalk and parking spaces indefinitely as outdoor dining spaces.\n\nOn September 16, 2021, videos surfaced showing Breed violating the city's mask mandate by not wearing a mask indoors while dancing at the Black Cat nightclub. She later explained the onstage reunion of the original members of Tony! Toni! Toné! \"was something really monumental that occurred...I got up and started dancing because I was feeling the spirit and I wasn’t thinking about a mask.\" Breed later responded to critics, \"Like, we don’t need the fun police to come in and try and micromanage and tell us what we should or shouldn’t be doing. No one has been more conservative about protecting themselves than I have, not just because I want to set an example, but because I don’t want to get COVID\", she added. The city's mask mandate, advocated by Breed, requires everyone to wear a mask indoors regardless of vaccination status. At the time of her presence at the concert, she was photographed not socially distancing or wearing a mask.\n\n\n\nA series of 2018 reports in the San Francisco Examiner focused on Breed's use of campaign funds carried over from previous years to pay for floats in San Francisco's annual , and a 2020 report found that Nick Bovis, a restaurant owner arrested alongside , was solely named on an invoice to pay for Breed's 2015 Pride float, when she was a member of the Board of Supervisors.\n\nFollowing the FBI's arrest of  director  on corruption charges, Breed published an article on  on February 14, 2020, acknowledging a longtime friendship and a brief relationship with Nuru. The post also reported that Nuru gave Breed $5,600 for car repairs. Breed argued she did not have to disclose since her and Nuru's relationship preceded her mayoralty but was doing so in \"the spirit of transparency\". \n\nA 2020 report in the San Francisco Chronicle found that the woman identified as \"Girlfriend 1\" by federal officials in the criminal complaint filed against Nuru was Sandra Zuniga, former Director of the city's \"Fix-It Team\" and of the Office of Neighborhood Services. The Neighborhood Services Office was dissolved shortly after Zuniga was identified as \"Girlfriend 1\" and remains inactive. In August 2021, Breed was fined $22,000 for abusing her office in a series of ethics violations.\n\n\n\n\nBreed's best-known environmental work is likely her successful fight to launch the city's clean electrical energy program, , a  program in which San Francisco purchases renewable, greenhouse-gas-free electrical energy and makes it available to San Francisco ratepayers. Its ultimate goal is to achieve 100% clean electrical energy in the city. According to the San Francisco Department of the Environment's Climate Action Strategy: \"Moving to 100% renewable electricity is the single biggest step the City can take to reduce GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions. The potential GHG emissions reduction from this program is estimated to total 941,000 metric tons (mT) of CO2e annually by 2030.\"\n\nWhen Breed took office in 2013 CleanPowerSF had, according to the San Francisco , \"languished for 12 years\" in the face of opposition from multiple mayoral administrations, the city's utility provider PG&E, and other business interests. \"Breed took it upon herself to get CleanPowerSF off the ground,\" said the League of Conservation Voters.\n\nUnder the city's charter, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission had ultimate authority to approve or reject the program. When they rejected proposed power rates for the program in August 2013, Breed authored a resolution at the Board of Supervisors, arguing: \"In failing to set not-to-exceed rates for CleanPowerSF, the Public Utilities Commission is contradicting the policy directives of the Board of Supervisors...The Board of Supervisors refuses to acquiesce its policymaking authority to the Executive bureaucracy; and... If the Public Utilities Commissioners fail to set not-to-exceed rates, or hereafter fail in any way to timely implement CleanPowerSF, the Board of Supervisors shall, whether at the Board Chamber or the ballot, exercise every means at its disposal to enact its policy objective.\"\n\nBreed worked for the subsequent 17 months to launch CleanPowerSF, often fighting with the Lee administration. In January 2015, Mayor Lee announced he would support a slightly revised version of CleanPowerSF, and the program proceeded toward launch.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, the  Local Union 1245, which represents PG&E employees, submitted a ballot measure, Proposition G, that would have imposed restrictions on CleanPowerSF. Breed and former Supervisor  wrote a competing measure, Proposition H, that would have required PG&E to disclose its use of nuclear power among other things. Following negotiations between IBEW representative Hunter Stern and Breed, Avalos, and their staff, IBEW agreed to oppose their own proposition and support Breed's measure. It passed with 80% support.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the city of San Francisco passed the nation's strongest ban on sale and use of products made from  foam, including expanded polystyrene foam (also called Styrofoam) for , egg cartons, coolers, and . The law made nationalnews.\n\nIn the final week of Breed's 2016 reelection campaign, she released a comical web video about the legislation, \"Styrofoam Monster\". In the ad, she chases away a bully who is dressed in a costume made of polystyrene foam. The '''' wrote, \"The award for most creative campaign ad goes to Board of Supervisors President London Breed..[It] is akin to an ingenious high school video production.\"\n\n\nIn 2015, the city of San Francisco passed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to fund a drug take-back program in San Francisco, enabling consumers to place unused medications in secure drop-off bins in pharmacies. Unused drugs are often disposed in the trash or toilet which can pollute waterways or lead to accidental poisonings. Breed published an op-ed in support of the legislation. It passed unanimously on March 17, 2015, making San Francisco only the third county in the nation to launch such a program. The program has collected well over 20 tons of medications.\n\nDespite her environmental record during her first term on the Board of Supervisors, the local chapter of the  endorsed her opponent. This prompted Breed's then-Chief of Staff Conor Johnston to write a scathing article in the San Francisco Examiner accusing the local Sierra Club chapter of hypocrisy and \"bewildering anti-environmentalism\" for blocking new housing and engaging in \"political tribalism\".\n\n\nBreed has explored multiple options for guaranteed income. In March 2021, Breed launched a program to provide guaranteed income to artists impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in November 2022, Breed launched a program to provide income for low income transgender individuals.\n\n\n\nIn September 2022, a public records request revealed Breed had required 48 of her appointees to boards and commissions to sign undated letters of resignation for her use. The Mayor's spokesperson stated the letters were only for \"the most extreme circumstances.\" Breed later announced she would discontinue the practice.\n\n\nAs of 2020, Breed lives in San Francisco's  neighborhood. Before becoming Mayor, her apartment was rent-controlled.\n\nIn February 2020, Breed made the '''''s ranking of \"A-List Eligibles,\" listing single celebrities who are notable in San Francisco. The ''Gazette'' described Breed as \"quite possibly the City’s hardest-working bachelorette,\" with Breed naming  and  as her celebrity crushes.\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n|years=2017–2018}}\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He narrowly lost to Democratic incumbent  but went on to defeat him two \nyears later and served in the Assembly from 1978 until 1992, when he opted not to seek reelection and instead run for congress.\n\nIn 2000 Wyman ran again for Assembly in the 34th Assembly District, which consisted of the Mojave Desert portion of San Bernardino County (except for the Morongo valley), the eastern Kern County desert/mountains area and Inyo County. He defeated the city manager of Victorville to win the Republican nomination, and then easily won the November 2000 general election in a heavily Republican district.\n\nIn 2002, redistricting after the 2000 Census prompted Wyman to run in the new 36th Assembly District. He moved to a small apartment in  (in the rural San Bernardino County desert) to qualify to run, which caused his political opponents to accuse him of being a carpetbagger.

Westly outspent him 5-to-1. McClintock's campaigns focused on increasing accountability for the state budget. The ads featured the character ''Angus McClintock'', a fictional cousin and fellow  extolling McClintock's thriftiness and accountability in low-budget 15-second ads.

The district's nine-term incumbent, , was retiring. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election. Although for most of the year he lived in , a suburb of  within the  at the time, his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, within the borders of his state senate district. The  requires state senators to maintain their legal residence in the district they represent.\n\nUpon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans  and Eric Egland withdrew from the primary and endorsed him. He was also endorsed by the , the , and U.S. Representative . McClintock faced former U.S. Representative , a moderate who represented the neighboring  from 1999 to 2005. Like McClintock, Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a  and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose, 54–39%.\n\nThe Democratic nominee was retired   Charles D. (Charlie) Brown, who had run an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the state senate even though he lived in Elk Grove for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his district. He said, \"Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here.\" Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock did not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but claimed his mother's home in Thousand Oaks as his state senate district residence. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stayed with his mother in order to care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband.

Brown won three of the district's nine counties: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%). McClintock won mainly on the coattails from , who carried the 4th with 54% of the vote, his fifth-best total in the state.\n\n\n\nMcClintock defeated Michael Babich in the Republican primary, Babich 78–22%. On November 2, he was reelected, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61–31% and winning every county in the district.\n\n\n\nFor his first two terms, McClintock represented a district covering the northeast corner of California, from the eastern suburbs of Sacramento to the Oregon border.\n\nRedistricting after the 2010 census pushed the 4th well to the south. Only three counties remained from the old 4th: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. The redrawn district cut out the 4th's share of Sacramento County, including the part of Elk Grove that includes McClintock's home. Elk Grove is now entirely within the borders of the neighboring , represented by Democrat , making McClintock one of only a few members of Congress who live outside the district they represent. House members are constitutionally required only to live in the state they represent, but longstanding convention holds that they live in or reasonably close to their districts. McClintock said in 2016 that he intended to move his residence inside the redrawn 4th as soon as home prices rebounded enough for him to sell his Elk Grove home.\n\nIn 2012, California instituted its \"top two\" primary, in which candidates of all parties run against one another and the top two finishers, regardless of party, advance to the general election. McClintock and Democrat  were the only candidates in the \"top two\" primary, so the general election was a rematch. The reconfigured 4th was as strongly Republican as its predecessor, and McClintock was reelected to a third term, defeating Uppal 61%–39% in the general election. McClintock won all but two of the district's ten counties: Alpine (41%) and Nevada (37%).\n\n\n\nMcClintock was reelected, finishing first in California's \"top two\" primary and defeating moderate Republican challenger National Guard Major Art Moore in the general election, 60%–40%.\n\n\n\nMcClintock again finished first in the primary and defeated Democrat Robert W. Derlet, a physician, environmentalist and retired  professor, in the general election, 63%–37%.\n\n\n\nMcClintock defeated Democratic challenger Jessica Morse in the general election, receiving 184,401 votes to her 156,253 (54.1% to 45.9%).\n\n\nDuring the  McClintock was one of 40 members of the  who frequently voted against Republican Party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In 2011, he voted against the  due to a provision that would allow the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

McClintock felt that Trump's firing of  justified a special prosecutor.\n\nAfter Trump pulled 1,000 U.S. troops from -held territory on the Syrian border south of Turkey in 2019, a bipartisan resolution passed the House, 354–60, that condemned him for abandoning those U.S. allies that would allow the  (ISIL) to reestablish and regroup its forces, and allow the Turks to attack the Kurds. McClintock was one of the two members of California's congressional delegation to vote against it.\n\nIn 2020, McClintock was the sole House Republican to cosponsor the , which was proposed in response to the  and resultant . The act was introduced by  and  and cosponsored by 62 House Democrats in addition to McClintock. Because Amash was a registered  as of the act's introduction in June 2020, McClintock's support technically made the act the first tripartisan piece of federal legislation in modern U.S. history.\n\nIn the , McClintock voted against multiple motions to discipline certain Democrats in office, such as the first censure of Adam Schiff, the censure of Rashida Tlaib, and the . In each, he lambasted their actions but believed the motions were an erosion of the standards to which such motions should be held.

These seven signed a letter that, while giving credence to election fraud allegations Trump made, said Congress did not have the authority to influence the election's outcome.\n\nMcClintock voted against impeaching Trump over his role in inciting the .\n\n\nMcClintock has said that \"farm animals are food, not friends.\"\n\n\nIn 2015, McClintock introduced an amendment to limit the enforcement of federal law in .

He attended , for three years before dropping out to work for his family's cattle and dairy business. He is a descendant of  immigrants. Pombo is married to the former Annette Cole and has three children. Even after being elected to Congress, he returned to his 500-acre (2&nbsp;km2) ranch near Tracy every week. Pombo is a .\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, Pombo served on the  City Council.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992, Pombo won the Republican primary by defeating several candidates in a race for an open seat in a district newly created by . California had added seven seats in the House after the 1990 . Pombo's strongest opponent in the Republican primary was  Republican Sandra Smoley, a  Supervisor.\n\nIn November, although the district had a Democratic majority and was carried by , Pombo nonetheless defeated Democrat Patti Garamendi (wife of current California Congressman ).\n\n\nPombo was reelected from this district in , , , and .\n\n\nFor his first five terms, Pombo represented a district covering almost all of  and a large slice of . However, Pombo's district was significantly altered as a result of the 2000 round of redistricting. He lost his share of Sacramento County to the 3rd district, and lost most of  to the 18th District. The district was pushed westward into the  when it picked up some of the more Republican-leaning portions of  and  counties, which had previously been part of the East Bay–based 10th district. Pombo was reelected in  and  after the redistricting.\n\n\nIn Congress, Pombo had a  track record. In 1994, during the , he was one of the signatories of the . He was a member of the conservative . He was given the nickname \"The Marlboro Man\" by President .\n\n\n\n\n}}\nPombo co-wrote a book in 1996 with  of  about private property issues, entitled ''This Land is Our Land: How to End the War on Private Property''. The San Joaquin County Citizen's Land Alliance, founded in July 1997, has been described as a group, co-founded by Pombo, that included farmers and other landowners advocating for private property rights and opposing government encroachment on these rights. As of March 2018 it was being led by Gary Barton as   Michael Petz as , with Nanette Martin serving as corporation secretary, and as of that date it was listed as terminated (its registration having expired).\n\nPombo's association with the defense of  was spurred by the 's abandonment of the  route through Tracy. Pombo owned land adjacent to the abandoned railroad line, and argued that the abandoned  should legally revert to the adjacent property owners (such as himself) rather than to the local park district. He further argued that as the easement was granted based on a promise that the land would be used for railroad purposes only, that the easements ended entirely when they were abandoned.\n\nPombo's case resulted in Congress passing the  Act. In a '''' editorial, Pombo was called \"an outspoken product of the extreme property rights movement.\" In 2005, he proposed legislation that would allow mining companies to buy lands on which they have staked claims, even if there is no evidence of valuable minerals on that land; according to the editorial, \"This has nothing to do with mining, and everything to do with stealing land that is owned by the American people.\"\n\n\nPombo supported the . In August 2006,  activists criticized him, citing an estimate that taxpayers in the 11th congressional district paid $974 million for the war by that time.\n\n\nIn a 2006 debate, Pombo said that \"intelligence agents should obtain   before monitoring phone calls\", but \"less than five months later, he voted to allow .\" He told the '''' that his vote was consistent with his statement, and that although the bill allows a delay in obtaining a warrant, it requires that Congressional Intelligence Committees and the  be notified, this maintaining  among the branches of government. An advocate for the  said the bill went further than Pombo acknowledged insofar as it allowed for the warrantless collection of large amounts of data as long as no specific individual was being targeted (and that the bill in fact defined \"electronic surveillance\" as excluding such activity). Pombo's opponent in 2006, , who went on to defeat Pombo, opposed the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2003 to 2007, a member of the , and was the Chairman of the , which has oversight and sets policy on matters involving ,  and . Pombo was also a co-chair of the  (HEAT), whose stated goal was to find alternative energy solutions.\n\n\nPombo was an early member of the , a Republican caucus that promotes the interest of Hispanic and Portuguese Americans. He was also a member and former Chairman of the Congressional , which is made up of Western State members of Congress concerned about  reform, , private property rights, and other issues affecting the western states. He was also, as of 2007, co-chair of the Portuguese Caucus, a coalition of Members of Congress who promote positive Portuguese-American relations, and a group he is said to have founded. In that role, he hosted prominent visitors from  to the United States, and the Portuguese government bestowed Pombo with the Grand Order of Infante D. Henrique, Portugal's highest civilian honor, in recognition of his efforts to improve Portuguese-American relations.\n\n\n as he signs the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act into law]]\nPombo proposed legislation to sell roughly a quarter of the land managed by the . In November 2005, Pombo and  (R-) co-authored an amendment to the Federal Budget Reconciliation Bill easing restrictions of sale of federal lands to mining companies. This amendment was opposed by , anti-growth advocates, and even some Republican Senators concerned about the measure's effects on hunting and fishing. The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was defeated in the Senate. The legislation was later described by his chief of staff as a \"bureaucratic exercise\" designed to evaluate the costs of not drilling in the  (ANWR).\n\nPombo supported oil drilling in the ANWR, despite concerns about the  and opposition from moderate Republicans.\n\nIn September 2005, Pombo helped write a revision of the 1973 . The proposed revision \"was widely denounced by environmentalists as a disturbing retreat from habitat protection and a paperwork nightmare for agencies seeking to revive the 1,268 threatened and endangered plants and animals in the country, 186 of which are in California.\" The bill did not pass.\n\nBy March 2006, ''Environmental Science & Technology'' reported that Pombo was coordinating efforts with Pac/West Communications to weaken the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Pac/West created the , an anti-environmental front group that campaigned for Pombo's bill to change the ESA.\n\nThe , a nonpartisan , assigned Pombo a lifetime average rating of 7 on a scale of 0 to 100. In 2005, he scored a 6. Subsequently, the organization named Pombo as one of the \"Dirty Dozen\" in 2006. LCV released an ad on October 31, 2006, citing Pombo's acceptance of $120,000 from oil companies and his ties to indicted lobbyist .\n\n'''' ranked him one of the worst congressmen and called him \"Enemy of the Earth\". The  called him an \"eco-thug\".\n\nAs the chairman of the , Pombo blocked legislation that would have created the  area in  state, despite broad support for the bill.\n\nHis political revival was characterized as giving environmentalists \"fits\" by the '''' in addition to describing his perception by that community as similar to that of Exxon-Valdez  or the hunter that shot 's mother.\n\nThe  added him to their Dirty Dozen list in 2010, even though this list is typically reserved for sitting members of Congress; and Warner Chabor, the organization's CEO, stated, \"Having Pombo represent a district that includes  is like electing  as mayor of \".\n\n\nIn 2006, , a nonpartisan watchgroup founded in 2005 by  and Democratic Party activists released a report naming Pombo as one of the 13 most corrupt members of Congress. Pombo issued a statement where he denied the allegations and described the group as \"a liberal-activist organization masquerading as a government watchdog group.\"\n\n\n\n\nPombo and his  ''RICH PAC'' was among a dozen leaders in the House of Representatives reportedly under investigation as part of the corruption and influence-peddling scandal centered around disgraced Washington lobbyist , and his policy issues, including . Pombo had accepted more money from Abramoff than had any other member of Congress ($500,000). Fundraisers organized by Indian gaming interests and tied to the 2005 MLB All-Star Game are among those activities under scrutiny.Erica Werner, , ''San Diego Union Tribune'', Associated Press, July 13, 2005\n\nOn January 8, 2006, the '''' alleged that Pombo helped one of Abramoff's clients, the  Indians in , gain federal recognition as a tribe. In return, Pombo received campaign contributions from both the tribe and Abramoff.Richard A. Serrano and Stephen Braun, , ''Los Angeles Times'', January 8, 2006\n\nIn the 2006 cycle, Abramoff was one of the top donors to Pombo's political action committee. Several of Pombo's top five donors are political influence brokers from , who hosted several $5,000-per-person fundraisers for Pombo in their  at  during the 2005 MLB All-Star Game. News reports indicated contributions from the two-day fundraising event would go to RICH Political Action Committee. However,  reports filed by RICH PAC show only one such contribution. Apparently contributions were diverted to some other entity making it difficult to track who attended and contributed.\n\nThe , owners of the MLB  and Detroit's , are also financial backers of various Indian tribes, including the , which is seeking to build a gaming casino on its reservation near . Various issues and tribal disputes involving the Shinnecock were before the House Resources Committee chaired by Pombo just days after the fundraiser.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, it was reported that Pombo \"says he never worked with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff in his fourteen years in Congress, but billing records suggest at least two interactions between the two in 1996\".\n\n\nVarious members of the Pombo family individually own more than  undeveloped near two proposed freeways. If even one of the proposed freeways is eventually built, the value of the property owned by Pombo's relatives and located near the proposed freeway will be worth far more than its currently assessed value.\n\nPombo led an effort to build a multilane  () through the mostly uninhabited  to facilitate -bound commuting from the greater Tracy area.\n\n\nPombo's home town of Tracy is close to a large  on . In 2004, Pombo's office sent a letter to then-Secretary of the Department of the Interior , urging the suspension of environmental guidelines opposed by the wind power industry. Pombo's parents have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties from wind-powered turbines on their  ranch. Pombo owns an interest in his parents' ranch.\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Pombo used his campaign and PAC funds to pay his brother Randall $272,000, and his wife (between 2003 and 2004) $85,000. In that 2003–04 campaign cycle, Pombo paid more to his family members$217,000than his opponent, , spent on his entire campaign. The two were paid for duties listed as bookkeeping, fundraising, consulting and other unspecified services.\n\nAfter publicity about the payments to his family, Randall was taken off Pombo's payroll (total payments between January 2005 and mid-2006 were less than $7,000). Pombo's wife continued to be paid at the rate of $3,000 per month.\n\n\nIn October 2004, Pombo used the franking privileges afforded members of Congress to mail approximately 175,000 copies of a two-page leaflet that openly praised the House Resources Committee and the  for overturning  limits on snowmobiling in national parks. The leaflets were sent to snowmobile owners in the s of  and . Pombo authorized the expenditure of $68,081 from House Resources Committee funds for the mailing of the leaflets as \"official business.\" House members are required to seek prior approval and obtain advisory opinions before sending out franked mail; no such approval was obtained prior to the October mailing.\n\n\nIn August 2003, Pombo and his family rented an RV and \"spent two weeks on vacation, stopping along the way to enjoy ... our national parks\". The  trip included stops in the , , , ,  and , , and other parks. The $4,935 cost of the rental was charged to the federal government, but was determined to be a more cost effective alternative to flying, renting a car, and staying in a hotel.\n\nWhen asked in February 2006 about the triprules forbid government-funded travel for personal vacations, but allow lawmakers to bring family members on official tripsPombo said that he had looked into flying into the parks by commercial air or charters, but found the costs to be excessive. After choosing to travel instead by RV, he invited his family along with him.\n\nAt , Pombo had a lengthy meeting with the park superintendent, which a spokesman charactizered as official. Pombo's visit to the  is in dispute: the secretary to the superintendent said he did not show; a spokesman for Pombo said that Pombo was certain he was there and met with a group of Native American tribal leaders nearby. Reports concerning Pombo's visit to  are also contradictory. The '''' was told that Pombo had shown up for his meeting but \"they were not there\". The '''' was told that Pombo met with the park's acting superintendent.\n\nOfficials from  and  national parks did not return calls seeking comment.Richard A. Serrano, , ''Los Angeles Times'', February 15, 2006\n\n\nOne January 8, 2006, the '''' reported that Pombo and Representative  had joined with then-House Majority Leader  of  to oppose an investigation by federal banking regulators into the affairs of  millionaire . The ''Times'' reported that \"When the  persisted, Doolittle and Pomboboth considered protegés of DeLayused their power as members of the House Resources Committee to  the agency's confidential records on the case, including details of the evidence FDIC investigators had compiled on Hurwitz.\" The investigation was ultimately dropped.\n\nAccording to the ''Times'', \"Although Washington politicians frequently try to help important constituents and contributors, it is unusual for members of Congress to take direct steps to stymie an ongoing investigation by an agency such as the FDIC.\" The article concluded, \"in the Hurwitz case, Doolittle and Pombo were in a position to pressure the FDIC and did so.\"\n\n\nOn September 23, 2006, the Central Valley ''Record'' reported that East Bay Representative  and six other House Democrats had requested that Pombo hold \"immediate\" congressional hearings concerning oil lease payments to the . The article noted that \"Miller and his alliesincluding Pombo's challenger,  consultant want oil companies such as  to renegotiate contracts they inked with Clinton administration officials that failed to include language requiring the firms to pay taxes when oil prices pass $36 a barrel.\" Pombo \"had a provision written into the House's offshore drilling legislation, which passed earlier this year, that would instead levy a fee on those firms that refuse to renegotiate their contracts.\"\n\n\nAn n oil services company under federal investigation in connection with allegations of influence peddling has contributed nearly $18,000 to Pombo. The investigation sparked a Washington state candidate for the Senate to return his contributions from -based  the day after the  raided offices of several Alaskan state legislators.\n\n\n\n\nAmid these growing scandals, Pombo faced serious primary opposition for the first time since his initial race in 1992. His leading opponent was former congressman , a leading moderate Republican. Earlier, McCloskey had led an effort to find a viable primary challenger to Pombo. Pombo defeated McCloskey in the primary with 61 percent of the vote. McCloskey had been endorsed by '''', the '''', and the . Seven weeks later, McCloskey endorsed Pombo's Democratic opponent, , who had won the Democratic primary over  and Steve Thomas. McNerney received just over half of the Democratic vote and faced Pombo in the 2006 general election in November. McNerney had been Pombo's opponent in 2004.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, a Democratic-commissioned poll was released with McNerney leading Pombo 48 percent to 46 percent. There were two polls commissioned by the NRCC, but results weren't released. Based on these events, in early October, '''' changed their rating of this race from ''Republican Favored'' to ''Leans Republican''. This was a significant development; Pombo had soundly defeated McNerney in 2004, taking 61 percent of the vote.\n\nOn November 7, 2006, Pombo was defeated by McNerney. McNerney got 53.1 percent of the vote to Pombo's 46.9 percent. Apart from prevailing national Democratic trends and the corruption allegations dogging him, Pombo was also the number one national target of environmental groups. Washington, D.C.-based  spent more than $1 million on the race and commissioned the first poll in 2005 that showed Pombo to be vulnerable in his re-election bid. The  sent over 300 volunteers and organizers to work for McNerney in the final weeks of the campaign. The group, allied with the League of Conservation Voters, also aired issue ads attacking Pombo. Pombo and  were the two Representatives targeted by the , which spent over $100,000 in Pombo's district, including organizers. Since Pombo left office, no other Republican has represented a significant part of the Bay Area in Congress.\n\nIn a letter dated November 29, 2006 from , Pombo states, \"I have accepted a position as Senior Partner at Pac/West, a full service political public relations firm with offices from California to Washington, D.C.\"\n\n\nOn January 4, 2010, Pombo announced his candidacy for Congress in  after Congressman , a fellow Republican, announced he wouldn't run for reelection. The 19th neighbors Pombo's former 11th district and leans more Republican than the 11th. Pombo said he \"didn't think [he] would ever run again, but when George Radanovich announced he wasn't running, my phone rang off the hook\". Pombo faced Radanovich-backed state Senator  and former  mayor  in the primary, which Jeff Denham won.\n\nPombo followed up his candidacy for Congress announcement by signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge sponsored by  on January 5, 2010. This marks the second time that Pombo signed the Pledge. He previously signed it as Representative of . According to ATR, Pombo has a lifetime rating of 91% from their annual Congressional Scorecards.\n\nPrimary opponent Jeff Denham stated that Pombo was a liability to the Republican Party who has \"given them a lot of material over the years\", a reference to his various scandals and notoriety among environmentalists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Grand Officer of the ,  (8 June 1996)\n\n\n tags-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n*  ''official 2010 campaign site''\n\n\n*  ''San Diego Union Tribune''\n* , \n* \n* \n\n\n* \n*  by ''Indianz.com''\n\n\n*  m ''''\n* , ''''\n* , profile of Pombo by ''''\n* .

He was asked by , the  moderator of a public affairs television show, \"Are you a gay man?\" Wachs responded: \"I am and I'm very proud of what I've done for the community, and I'm also very proud of the fact that what I've done for the community is what I've done for all communities.\"\n\n\nWachs was born on March 1, 1939, in , the son of Hannah (Stahler) and Archie Wachs, a teacher. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland who ran a grocery and butcher shop. The younger of two sons, Joel \"suffered from  so severe that at the height of the  season, his parents sat him in the shop's  room, in a fur coat, to help him breathe\". They moved to Los Angeles when Wachs was ten, where his family became wealthy with a chain of inexpensive ladies' clothing stores. He grew up in , between 79th and 83rd streets and  and . |last1=Clayton |first1=Janet |title=Council's New President Might Have Been Song and Dance Man |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 July 1981 |page=b1 }}\n\nHe attended Horace Mann Junior High School and , followed by the , where the \"gregarious\" Wachs was president of his  and  classes, and of the . He earned a degree at  and a Master of Laws in taxation from . When in Los Angeles, he lived in .\n\n\nAfter completing his education, Wachs was an attorney with the Los Angeles firm of Gray, Binkley & Pfaelzer (later became Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard & Quinn) and practiced law for five years. He told a reporter in 1991, \"I didn't love practicing tax law&nbsp;... the result of my efforts was finding ways to save rich people money. And I didn't find that satisfying.\"\n\n\n\nWachs served on the  from July 1, 1971, to September 28, 2001, when his resignation took effect. His 30 years on the council were surpassed only by 's 35 years, 's 32 years and 's 31.\n\n\n\nIn May 1971, Wachs, \"a young political newcomer,\" \"overwhelmed\" veteran  in , which included portions of the  and the . The vote was 24,704 for Wachs and 14,898 for Potter. His victory was attributed in part to his opposing a multimillion-dollar development in the mountains just north of .\n\nAt 33, he became the City Council's youngest member. |last1=Bryant |first1=Pat |title=Wachs 'Working Hard, Enjoying It': Wachs Says His Work Hard but Enjoyable |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=17 October 1971 |page=sf_c1 }}\n\nIn 1986, a redistricting move stripped Wachs of more than 90% of his old district, and put him into a new one that ran from his home in Studio City to  in the far northeast San Fernando Valley. He was nevertheless easily reelected in April 1987 in the realigned, more conservative district, despite the opposition of the Los Angeles Apartment Owners Association, which attacked him because of his fight for . Wachs was reelected in every vote thereafter.\n\n\nAfter ten years on the City Council, two of them as president pro-tem, Wachs was suddenly and unexpectedly elected  in July 1981 when outgoing President  decided to drop out of the contest against Councilwoman  and, with Councilwoman  as a partner, put up Wachs as a candidate instead. Wachs was elected to a two-year term in an 8–7 vote, with Wachs breaking a pledge to Russell to vote for her and casting a vote for himself instead. He later described the turn of events as akin to a \"Hollywood movie\" and, inasmuch as Mayor  was soon to become a candidate for governor, he had plenty of opportunity to act as mayor when Bradley was out of town. |title=WACHS: Right Place, Right Time |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=31 January 1982 |page=b1 }} He served for two years.\n\n\nWachs resigned from the City Council 2001 to accept the presidency of the  Foundation for the Visual Arts. His last day on the City Council was September 28 of that year.\n\n\n\nWachs thrice ran for mayor of Los Angeles. In 1973, as a relatively unknown new city council member, he finished a distant fifth in a crowded primary in an election in which  eventually won his first term as Los Angeles mayor.\n\nIn 1993, he finished third behind  and .\n\nHe ran again in  and finished fourth with 11% of the vote, behind ,  and .\n\n\nIn 1977, Wachs was appointed vice chairman of a new National Task Force on the Arts, whose goal, he said, was \"to put the arts and culture on the agenda of every city government as a mainstream economic and social concern\". In a 1981 interview, he said he spent one-third of his $43,923 annual salary (equivalent to between $ and $ in ) on works of art for himself and that, when the time came to leave the City Council, he could be happy practicing law, \"being a  in a nice restaurant,\" or \"heading an arts foundation\". In 1987 he flew to  to be a part of a seven-member panel that tried to determine what to do with a 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long outdoor steel sculpture by  titled \",\" which had drawn complaints and was eventually disassembled, removed, and put in storage.\n\nHe was the author of an ordinance that requires  to set aside 1% of the value of all projects over $500,000 for cultural and artistic projectseither spending the money on their own, or depositing it with the city for such use.\n\nWachs was active in strengthening Los Angeles' ordinance on  but was equally active when the city's Building and Safety Commission at first attempted to classify a proposed work by  as a sign that fell under its jurisdiction. It later reversed itself and Wachs specifically compared the commission's initial decision to the prosecution of a Cincinnati museum over a show by photographer .\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Wachs resigned his council seat and moved to  in order to serve as president of the  Foundation for the Visual Arts. Wachs is nominally the chairman of the . Wachs's salary at the charity is over $350,000 per year, which does not include generous expenses and a pension plan of approximately 20%. Although this is nearly four times the average salary for such a position, some have argued that the Warhol Foundation is unusually complex as well as being more influential than most similar organizations.\n\nIn 2010, Wachsin his Warhol Foundation roleprotested the removal of a  piece from the \"Hide/Seek\" exhibit at the . The foundation had supported the exhibition with a $100,000 grant. Wachs wrote to the head of the  (NPG's parent organization), , on behalf of the foundation's unanimous board with the \"demand that the Smithsonian restore the work ... to the exhibition or the foundation would reject any future grant requests\". Wachs' letter said in part, \"For the arts to flourish, the arts must be free, and the decision to censor this important work is in stark opposition to our mission to defend freedom of expression wherever and whenever it is under attack.\" There were no signs of reinstatement of the Wojnarowicz piece by the NPG.\n\n\n\"Wachs defied easy categorization on the council, emerging as a populist who railed against what he saw as insider dealing in City Hall and misuse of taxpayer funds. He also was a staunch advocate for the arts and for civil rights.\" He was known as a \"moderate to liberal Republican\" but reregistered as an independent before running for mayor in 1993. He backed efforts that resulted in public financing of city elections and creation of an ethics commission.\n\n\nWachs is sometimes cited as the originator of  in Los Angeles. He organized the first onesin , , - and the hill area south of  in November 1971, choosing the first members himself from a range of backgrounds. He launched numerous studies of such councils in other cities and produced a booklet to help guide the new representative community groups in Los Angeles.\n\n\nIn 1971, he proposed a ban on oil drilling on the city's coastline one-half mile inland from the shore \"for both esthetic and geographical safety reasons\".\n\n\nHe was a supporter of levying a city income tax in order to relieve property owners of a tax burden.\n\n\nHe was a decided advocate for  in an effort to keep housing affordable for the elderly and the poor.\n\n\nWachs and Councilwoman  sponsored what Wachs called \"the strongest  ordinance in the U.S.,\" prohibiting job and housing discrimination based on sexual orientation. His measure outlawing employment discrimination against  was passed unanimously by the City Council, despite the fact that his mail on the subject was running heavily against it.\n\n\nIn 1981, Wachs called for mandatory separation of  from regular trash before collection to cope with the city's \"growing refuse-disposal crisis\".\n\n\nWachs successfully advocated for an ordinance change that would allow artists to live and work in commercially zoned districts. He also worked to create a city Cultural Affairs Department. |last1=Simon |first1=Richard |title=Wachs Heavy Favorite in 6-Way City Council Race: 2nd District Challengers Have Scant Funds, Hope |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=7 April 1983 |page=v1 }}\n\n\nWachs cast the only vote against a city ordinance prohibiting minors from purchasing , saying in 1983 he did not think police officers should spend their time raiding .\n\n\nHe proposed an eventually successful idea for the city to provide a number of , where Los Angeles' nearly 200,000 licensed dogs could run free.\n\n\nWachs emerged as the sole City Council member who helped broker an agreement that enabled Police Chief  to resign his post in June 1992 and retire \"in an orderly fashion\" after a crisis occasioned by the March 1991 beating of  and as well as the issuance of a final, critical report of the police department by the . Wachs and Gates forged a bond of trust, it was said, when the councilman leaped to the chief's defense after the city Police Commission briefly removed Gates in the wake of the riots.\n\n\nWachs went to Sacramento in January 1984 to unsuccessfully argue with state prison authorities that , the  who had killed gay leader  and Mayor , should be moved out of , where he had been d after serving five years in prison for the killings.\n\n\nWachs was credited with forging a 1997 deal with the developers of a  that lifted some of the onerous provisions that would have worked to the financial disadvantage of the city. In return for the concessions, he agreed to exempt the arena from a ballot measure he was preparing to require voter approval for any subsidized sports stadiums.\n\n\nWachs was an advocate for slow-growth development and was one of the cowriters of , along with  and .\n\n\n\n\nWachs was known for his boisterous personality. When he was newly elected to the , he distributed a mock ordinance that would supposedly have taxed all male residents on the size of their genitals. Occasionally he exclaimed \"This is fun!\" in the middle of a committee meeting. His colleagues described him as \"a human guy, a lot of heart\".\n\nIn recognition of Wachs' involvement in promoting the arts, the City Council in 2002 named the intersection of Grand Avenue and Second Street as \"Joel Wachs Square\".

The Student Loan Fairness Act of 2019 addresses this crisis in three major ways: creating a new \"10-10\" standard, capping the interest rate, and accounting for cost of living.

Her daughter, Emilia Bass-Lechuga, and son-in-law, Michael Wright, were killed in a car crash in 2006.\n\n\nOn September 9, 2022, Bass's Los Angeles home was burglarized and two firearms were stolen.

Preston spent the late 1990s working at public interest firms and clerked for Judge  at the  from 1997 to 1998. He joined the non-profit Tenderloin Housing Clinic in 2000 and transitioned to tenant rights law. As a staff attorney for THC, Preston represented tenants against evictions, particularly tenants facing eviction due to California’s '''', a law passed in 1985 which allows landlords to evict all tenants in a building and take the building out of the housing market.\n\nPreston was a co-owner of the bar and nightclub Cafe du Nord in the .\n\nIn 2008, Preston founded Tenants Together, a coalition of more than 50 local tenant rights organizations in California. Preston served as Executive Director of the organization which advocated for state legislation and helped form local tenant unions to push for rent control and tenants rights laws in several cities in California.\n\n\n campaign event in 2019]]\n\n\nPreston ran against incumbent  in the  for District 5 but lost 48% to 52%.\n\nIn July 2018, Preston, a member of the San Francisco chapter of the  (DSA), became a candidate for the 2019 District 5 Supervisor election, to fill the vacancy left when Breed became mayor. Shortly after, Breed appointed  to the fill the position, and Brown ran as an incumbent. Preston ran as a  and won the election by a narrow margin, becoming the first democratic socialist elected to the board since  stepped down in 1993. Preston was sworn in on December 16, 2019.\n\nPreston ran as an incumbent in , with Brown campaigning for her former seat. He won against Brown 55% to 45%.\n\n\n\nPreston authored San Francisco's 2018 Proposition F, which directs the city to establish a universal  for tenants facing eviction. The proposition was approved in June 2018 by a vote of 55%. After joining the Board of Supervisors, Preston continued to advocate for the program that provides legal representation to tenants in eviction court for the duration of their cases. By August 2020, the program was already underfunded by $4 million when the Mayor Breed announced an additional $1 million cut to the program in her proposed budget. Preston and other supervisors rejected the budget cuts and instead approved a $750,000 increase.\n\nIn April 2020, Preston introduced an ordinance to permanently bar eviction of tenants for failure to pay rent because of issues related to the . The measure, which passed the Board of Supervisors in June 2020 by a vote of 10 to 1, not only barred evictions but also prohibited fees, penalties, interest and other charges incurred due to the pandemic. A group of associations representing landlords in San Francisco filed a lawsuit in the  challenging the ordinance but the court upheld the eviction prohibition in August 2020.\n\nPreston again introduced legislation to extend eviction protections in May 2021 as the state-wide eviction moratorium in effect at the time was due to expire. The Board of Supervisors passed Preston's eviction protection legislation in June 2021 to extend the moratorium until the end of 2021, but the state legislature a week later passed its own extension to September 2021, cutting short San Francisco's local measure by three months. In September 2021, the Board unanimously adopted emergency legislation introduced by Preston to temporarily bar \"no-fault evictions due to owner move-ins, condo conversions, breach of contract, capital improvements, renovations and demolition of a unit\".\n\nIn October 2021, Preston started a tenant outreach campaign promoting his district as an “eviction-free zone\", including programs to educate residents about ways to avoid eviction and obtain rental assistance. In December 2021, he proposed an ordinance to require landlords to give a 10-day advance notice to tenants before filing for eviction. The Board of Supervisors unanimously passed the measure in January 2022. Preston led a successful effort in August 2022 to stop the eviction of several Black residents of the King-Marcus Garvey Apartments in  who were being evicted due to a technicality in the regulations.\n\n\nIn April 2020, Preston co-introduced legislation with Supervisors ,  and  to require Mayor Breed to secure 8,250 hotel rooms to house the homeless during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preston also raised the funds to rent 30 rooms at the Oasis Inn near City Hall to house homeless people. The following month, he supported the establishment of \"safe sleeping sites\", including one in his district at an empty lot in the  neighborhood. The site included a security guard and access to food and bathrooms.\n\nIn September 2021, Preston questioned the proposed acquisition of a tourist hotel in Japantown for use as . The acquisition, one of four proposed by Mayor Breed, was opposed by some residents of the Japantown neighborhood, and Preston who represents the neighborhood suggested two other tourist hotels in his district as alternatives. The owners of the Kimpton Buchanan Hotel backed out of the deal but the Board, including Preston, approved the purchase of the three other hotels in October 2021. The Board later also approved the purchase of one of the hotels suggested by Preston in February 2022.\n\n\n\nThe ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reports that, according to  critical of his housing policies, Preston opposed development plans and legislative proposals that could have housed more than 28,000 people, including affordable housing for nearly 8,500 people, from December 2019 to November 2021.\n\nPreston has argued, \"San Francisco is a shining example of the complete and utter failure of the free market to address housing needs.\" He has blamed homelessness in San Francisco on \"unbridled capitalism.\" He has criticized ism as \"a new face on private market developers' interests.\" In 2019, Preston opposed , which would have eased housing construction near public transit, arguing that it was a \" bill.\" In 2019, Preston spoke against the construction of a 186-unit apartment complex because only 20% of the apartments were for affordable housing while Preston wanted 33%.\n\nPreston is a proponent of rent control. In 2021, Preston blocked discussion of a proposal that would have required 50 signatures to invoke the California Environmental Quality Act to block housing projects, rather than just one person complaining. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Preston appears \"to be one of the supervisors most opposed to building market-rate housing\".\n\nIn 2020, Preston delayed a major zoning plan which would have led to the construction of thousands of housing units to the Van Ness/Market Street area of San Francisco. He called for a \"race and equity study\" of the project.\n\nPreston also introduced two ballot initiatives approved by voters in the November 2020 election. Proposition I raised the transfer tax rate for property sales valued over $10 million, intended to fund affordable housing. Proposition K authorizes the city of San Francisco to build or acquire up to 10,000 units of affordable housing. In March 2020, Preston successfully proposed in the Board of Supervisors to appropriate $10 million from the funds raised by Proposition I to fund rent relief and $10 million to fund additional affordable housing. The Board of Supervisors allocated an additional $32 million from the funds for rent relief in late June 2020. In November 2021, Preston led a successful proposal to allocate $64 million from Proposition I to fund the Small Sites Program, which subsidizes about half the cost to allow nonprofit organizations to purchase small apartment buildings with residents at risk of displacement. In June 2022, he fought to secure additional affordable housing funding including $40 million for land acquisition, $20 million for public housing repairs, $10 million for elevator repairs in hotels used to house homeless residents, and $12 million for teacher housing.\n\nIn a committee meeting on the shared spaces program established by the city during the , Preston supported a two-week delay on voting to make the outdoor dining spaces permanent. His questions on an indefinite extension centered on public access and .\n\nIn March 2021, Preston called for a hearing on housing vacancies, arguing that the focus on building new housing had led to ignoring \"the single biggest source of potential housing in San Francisco.\" In 2022, Preston proposed a ballot measure to tax vacant housing in San Francisco. The tax would apply to owners of buildings with three or more units when at least one of them has been unoccupied for more than six months in one year. The tax exempted vacant single-family homes and two-unit buildings. Revenue from the measure is earmarked for rental subsidies for low-income seniors and acquiring vacant properties for affordable housing. The measure passed with 54% of the votes.\n\nIn October 2021, Preston voted against the construction of a 495-unit apartment complex (one-quarter of which were designated as affordable housing) on a parking lot next to a BART station. Preston said that the construction of the apartment complex on the parking lot was \"gentrification.\"\n\n\nIn January 2021, Preston introduced an ordinance, co-sponsored by five other supervisors, to start the process of establishing a public bank in San Francisco after the 2019 passage of California's ''Public Banking Act''. Preston’s legislation creates a working group to generate a business and governance plan for a public bank to be presented to the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the ordinance in June 2021 and the working group convened for its first meeting in April 2022.\n\n\nA few months after taking office, Preston introduced a resolution opposing proposed fare increases by the  (SFMTA). Preston's resolution introduced in February 2020 called on the SFMTA to avoid fare increases throughout the fiscal year 2021–2022 budget cycle. The Board of Supervisors approved the resolution in April 2020 and Preston also called on the San Francisco Attorney’s Office to investigate if the proposed fare increase violated California statute forbidding price increases more than 10 percent during a declaration of an emergency. The SFMTA board went ahead with the 12% fare increase a week after. In response, Preston and Supervisor  proposed a charter amendment to strip the authority to increase fares from the SFMTA board. An agreement was reached in June 2020 in which the fare increases would be reversed and the charter amendment withdrawn.\n\nIn February 2021, he called for a study into the feasibility of a city-run bike-share program. In April 2021, Preston and Haney introduced a three-month pilot program for \"Free Muni\", free public transportation service funded by the city. The Board of Supervisors approved the measure on May 25, 2021. However, Mayor Breed vetoed the measure in late June before the pilot program could begin the following month. In December 2021, Preston also proposed a resolution which passed unanimously calling an end to street parking at about 1,000 of the city’s bus stops.\n\n\nIn July 2021, Preston was the sole dissenting vote against the city’s budget, citing increases in police spending and a lack of investment in social housing as the reasons for his vote. He again was the sole dissenting vote on the budget in July 2022, citing the $50 million increase to the police budget.\n\nWhen the  (SFPD) requested approval from the Board of Supervisors to allow SFPD to use  to kill suspects under certain circumstances, Preston was one of three supervisors that voted against the proposal in late November 2021. After significant backlash from residents, the Board reversed its decision a week later by unanimously approving an amended policy barring SFPD from using robots to kill.\n\n\nPreston introduced ballot measure Proposition H in May 2022 to shift local elections from odd-numbered to even-numbered years in an effort to increase voter participation. Twice as many voters participated in the 2020 presidential election compared to voters in the local elections for mayor, sheriff, treasurer, city attorney, and district attorney in 2019. While a similar bill was voted down in 2008, Proposition H passed with more than 70% of the votes.\n\n\nPreston is married. He and his wife live in a single family house in the  neighborhood in San Francisco. The home was valued at $2.5 million in 2024, three times as much as Preston paid for it in 1999. The family trust of Preston's wife owns several buildings in San Francisco.\n\nHe has been on the board of the Alamo Square Neighborhood Association. In the early 2000s, he worked to stop fast-food franchises such as  and  from moving into Alamo Square. Preston owns stock shares valued between $400,000 and $4 million in Apple, Microsoft, IBM and Cisco.\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On March 7, 2017, Buscaino won re-election again with 74.85% of the vote.\n\nFollowing his election, Buscaino was appointed by the city council president to serve as chairman of the Public Works Committee. The committee has oversight of the Department of Public Works, and its Bureaus of Sanitation, Street Services, Street Lighting, Engineering, and Contract Administration. The Department of Public Works is the city's third-largest department and has a staff of more than 5,000 employees, who are responsible for the construction, renovation, and operation of City facilities and infrastructure. The department also installs sewers, constructs storm drains, and builds the city's streets, as well as public buildings, rights-of-way, and service facilities.\n\nOther committee assignments include Public Safety, which includes the ,  and Emergency Management; Trade, Travel & Tourism, which includes the ,  and the ; Economic Development which includes , Transportation which includes  and the Board of Referred Powers. \n\n\n\nBuscaino represents the 15th Council District which is made up of five communities , , , , and  as well as the . In 2013, the 15th Council District had a population of 275,486 people.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Buscaino successfully lobbied for the creation of Watts Serenity Park, a 1.13 acre parcel of land that was previously vacant and often the site of drug use and violent crimes. The $5 million project provided a safe space for community recreation with play equipment for kids, a Fitness Zone® exercise area for adults, and a skate park.\n\nBuscaino also pushed for the renovation and re-opening of the 109th Street Pool and Rec Center in July 2016. A $4 million project that created 18 jobs, the area now offers residents the option of using a baseball diamond, indoor and outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, tennis courts, a multipurpose sports field, and the 109th Street Pool, complete with a splash pad for younger children.\n\nIn March 2015, Buscaino also announced the 103rd St. Streetscape Improvement Project, which utilizes $1.25 million in METRO funding to ensure an improved experience for pedestrians using the 103rd St. blue line stop. Improvements to the streetscape include: 5 irrigated landscaped median islands, a gateway monument, access ramps, trash receptacles, benches, bicycle racks, way-finding signage, high visibility crosswalks, and sidewalk improvements.\n\nBuscaino plans to use part of the $2 million in Green Streets funding given to the 15th District to make improvements to the historic  area. These improvements aim to revitalize the area by planting hundreds of new trees, repaving sidewalks, repairing and replacing lights, and investing in the development of the Watts Towers Cultural Crescent.\n\n\n\nCouncilman Buscaino's Office has collaborated with the LA Great Streets Team and the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative to produce the Gaffey Street Conceptual Plan, which outlines an estimated $7.2 million in improvements along the entrance to  The funding will allow for changes like landscaped medians, high visibility crosswalks, traffic signal synchronization, coordinated street furniture, sidewalk repairs and street sweeping, a solar powered Soofa bench, landscape enhancements and public art. The Conceptual Plan proposes traffic calming, improving the Gaffey St. pedestrian experience, making the landscape more drought tolerant, and providing more public spaces for the San Pedro community.\n\nCouncilman Buscaino helped create and support Clean San Pedro, a non-profit organization dedicated to cleaning and revitalizing the Pacific Corridor area of San Pedro. CSP was built by residents of San Pedro who were frustrated with the lack of beautification efforts in their city. These activists now perform a variety of functionsdaily litter and debris removals, reporting of graffiti, weekly sidewalk cleaning, etc.--with the purpose of preserving their city's natural beauty. See cleansanpedro.net for more information.\n\nSan Pedro Courthouse: Councilman Buscaino's Office helped oversee the search for a developer who could transform the space occupied by the now-closed San Pedro Courthouse. The courthouse closed in January 2013, and since then, the area has been the subject of frequent conversations, as its location in the heart of downtown San Pedro makes it lucrative property. In November 2016, the LA County Board of Supervisors announced plans to team up with real estate firm Holland Partner Group to build a multi-use development in the 1.8 acre space. Past projections by the Supervisors indicated that the area could accommodate up to 250 residential apartments.\n\nSan Pedro Waterfront Redevelopment Project:\nFor years, San Pedro's  has undergone a steady decline in revenues and community engagement. While busy on weekends, the market is often dull during the week, and as a result, roughly a fifth of the shops have been forced to close. The San Pedro Waterfront Redevelopment Project, a $100 million dollar endeavor, will revitalize much of LA's waterfront. The Ports O' Call village will be torn down and replaced with the San Pedro Public Market, a 16 acre development that will feature restaurants, markets, bars, shops, offices, a waterfront promenade, and an amphitheater for live entertainment. Construction on the project is set to begin in late 2017.\n\nPush for faster rescue boats: Ever since a tragic April 2015 accident that claimed the lives of two children in the , Councilman Buscaino has been vocal about the need for faster rescue boats. The Councilman continues to advocate for the purchase of new, faster response boats. The current response boat for the Port of LA is Fireboat 2, which was acquired by the city Fire Department in 2003; Fireboat 2 is the largest boat of its kind west of the Mississippi, but with that size comes a tradeoff of speed.\n\n\nBuscaino is a staunch opponent of cutting police budgets and . A former full-time police officer, Buscaino still serves as a reserve officer. His experience as a police officer is considered one of the reasons for his election to the City Council. He was elected for the first time to the council with more than $220,000 in donations from the  , a fact that came under scrutiny in light of renewed opposition to police union spending.\n\nIn June 2020, in the wake of  following the , Buscaino organized a \"unity march\" with the  and the . In a July 2020 vote to cut the  by $150 million, Buscaino was one of the only two votes against the proposal. In an op-ed, Buscaino claimed that conversations with police officers convinced him that policing needs \"smart investments\" and \"deliberate planning,\" rather than funding cuts.\n\n\nOn November 10, 2018, Joe Buscaino was named First Vice President of the  after previously serving as the Second Vice President of the NLC. In 2018, the annual NLC City Summit was held in Los Angeles, where Buscaino acted as the host of the event for over 5,000 mayors, city officials, and staff members. He was elected as president on November 23, 2019.\n\n\n\nBuscaino had been speculated as a candidate for  in the . On March 15, 2021, Buscaino announced his campaign for mayor. On May 12, 2022, Buscaino announced the end of his mayoral campaign before the primary election took place. He received less than 5,000 votes.\n\n\n\nA 2017 editorial in the  criticized the geographical makeup of District 15, and argued that it resulted in lack of representation for communities like Watts and Harbor Gateway. The piece argues that Buscaino continues to be exclusively re-elected by the people of San Pedro, meaning that Buscaino is beholden only to this small community. The editorial describes his performance as \"adequate  no more and no less.\"\n\n\nBuscaino ignited controversy when he spoke out against the motion of the Los Angeles City Council to rebrand  as . The move to change the name was largely supported by Native American activists, with the notable endorsement of Councilmember . Buscaino opposed a name change, but offered a compromise title of Immigrant Heritage Day. Buscaino's opposition and argument for  was very rare, with Buscaino describing the proposal as \"divisive\". The measure passed 14-1 with only Buscaino dissenting.\n\n\nBuscaino has lived in the 15th Council District all his life. He has served on the board of directors of the  of the Harbor Area, the San Pedro 's Racial Justice Committee and the Advisory Council for the Los Angeles Watts Summer Games. He is a member of  and is active in Italian-American organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n*\n*\n*\n*\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He acknowledged his homosexuality in adolescence but secretly pursued sexual relationships well into adulthood. The  caused him to shed many of his conservative views about individual freedom and sexual expression. Milk moved to San Francisco in 1972 and opened a camera store. Although he held an assortment of jobs and frequently changed addresses, he settled in , a neighborhood that was experiencing a mass immigration of gay men and lesbians. He ran for city supervisor in 1973 but the existing gay political establishment resisted him. Milk's campaign was compared to theater due to his personality, earning media attention and votes, although not enough to be elected. He campaigned again in the next two supervisor elections, dubbing himself the \"Mayor of Castro Street\". The voter response caused him to also run for the . Due to his growing popularity, he led the  in battles against anti-gay initiatives. Milk was elected city supervisor in 1977 after San Francisco began to choose neighborhood representatives rather than city-wide ones. During Milk's almost eleven months in office, he sponsored a bill banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodations, housing, and employment. The Supervisors passed the bill by a vote of 11–1, and Mayor  signed it into law. On November 27, 1978,  by , a disgruntled former city supervisor who cast the sole vote against Milk's bill.\n\nDespite his short political career, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr in the LGBTQ community.Milk was described as a martyr by news outlets as early as 1979, by biographer Randy Shilts in 1982, and University of San Francisco professor Peter Novak in 2003. United Press International [October 15, 1979]; printed in the ''Edmonton Journal'', p. B10; Skelton, Nancy; Stein, Mark [October 22, 1985]. , ''Los Angeles Times'', Retrieved on February 3, 2012.; Shilts, p. 348; Nolte, Carl [November 26, 2003]. \"City Hall Slayings: 25 Years Later\", '''', p. A-1. In 2002, Milk was called \"the most famous and most significant openly  official ever elected in the United States\". , his final campaign manager, wrote of him: \"What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us.\" Milk was posthumously awarded the  in 2009.\n\n\n\n\nHarvey Bernard Milk was born in the New York City suburb of , to William Milk and Minerva Karns. He was the younger son of  parents and the grandson of Morris Milk, a department store owner who helped to organize the first synagogue in the area. As a child, Milk was teased for his protruding ears, big nose, and oversized feet, and tended to grab attention as a class clown. While he was in school, he played football and developed a passion for opera. Under his name in the high school yearbook, it read, \"Glimpy Milkand they say WOMEN are never at a loss for words\".\n\nMilk graduated from  in , in 1947 and attended New York State College for Teachers in  (now the ) from 1947 to 1951, majoring in mathematics. He also wrote for the college newspaper.  One classmate remembered, \"He was never thought of as a possible queerthat's what you called them thenhe was a man's man\".\n\n\nAfter graduation, Milk joined the  during the . He served aboard the   as a . Milk later transferred to  to serve as a diving instructor. In 1955, he resigned from the Navy at the rank of , forced to accept an \"other than honorable\" discharge and leave the service rather than be court-martialed because of his homosexuality.While Milk said numerous times that he was  and claimed it was because he was gay, for a number of years this claim was doubted. For example, his biographer  was skeptical of this claim, stating: \"The Harvey Milk of this era was no political activist, and according to available evidence, he played the more typical balancing act between discretion and his sex drive.\" In addition, the Harvey Milk Archives-Scott Smith Collection included a photocopy of what appeared to be Milk's honorable discharge paperwork from the U.S. Navy. However, a records request from the U.S. Navy revealed that he did indeed receive an \"other than honorable\" discharge and was forced to resign for being gay. It appears Milk forged the discharge papers now in his archives in order to be employed after leaving the service.\n\nMilk's early career was marked by frequent changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at  on . In 1956, he met  at the  beach, a popular location for gay men in . Milk pursued Campbell passionately. Milk continued to write Campbell romantic notes and poems after they moved in together. Seeking a warmer climate with milder winters, Milk and Campbell left New York in 1957 and moved to , Texas; after they struggled to find employment and were disappointed with the city's social scene compared to New York, they moved back to the latter. In New York, Milk worked as a public school teacher in Long Island and then a stock analyst in . In 1961, Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years.\"Historical Note\",   (PDF),    . Retrieved on October 8, 2008.\n\n\n\nMilk tried to keep his early romantic life separate from his family and work. Once again bored and single in New York, he thought of moving to Miami to marry a lesbian friend to \"have a  and each would not be in the way of the other\". However, he decided to remain in New York, where he secretly pursued gay relationships. In 1962, Milk became involved with , who was 10 years younger. Though Milk courted Rodwell ardently, waking him every morning with a call and sending him notes, Milk was uncomfortable with Rodwell's involvement with the New York , a gay-rights organization. When Rodwell was arrested for walking in Riis Park, and charged with inciting a riot and with indecent exposure (the law required men's swimsuits to extend from above the navel to below the thigh), he spent three days in jail. The relationship soon ended as Milk became alarmed at Rodwell's tendency to agitate the police.In addition to his concerns over Rodwell's activism, Milk believed that Rodwell had given him . (Carter, pp. 31–32.)\n\nMilk abruptly stopped working as an insurance actuary and became a researcher at the  firm . He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work.\"Harvey Bernard Milk.\" ''Dictionary of American Biography'', Supplement 10: 1976–1980. Charles Scribner's Sons, 1995.  Before Milk's thirty-fourth birthday, he started a romantic relationship with a 17-year-old boy (b. October 18, 1946) named Jack Galen McKinley after he left his hometown on October 22, 1963. Milk had recruited McKinley to work on conservative  's . McKinley was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt after his lover  left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the  art scene in , but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency caused to him consider committing suicide.\n\n\nSince the end of World War II, the major port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men who had been expelled from the military and decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism.D'Emilio, John. \"Gay Politics and Community in San Francisco since World War II\", in ''Hidden From History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past'', New American Library (1989). .  By 1969 the  believed San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the  asked the institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for , a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of ''''. McKinley was offered a job in the New York City production of '''', and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the , Milk let his hair grow long. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.\n\nMilk drifted from California to Texas to New York, without a steady job or plan. In New York City he became involved with O'Horgan's theater company as a \"general aide\", signing on as associate producer for ''Lenny'' and for 's ''Inner City''.Gruen, John (January 2, 1972). , ''The New York Times'', p. SM14. The time he had spent with the cast of ren wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary ''New York Times'' story about O'Horgan described Milk as \"a sad eyed mananother aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads\". Craig Rodwell read the description of the formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person.Shilts, p. 44. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: \"I think he was happier than at any time I had ever seen him in his entire life.\" 's documentary short film ''Homosexuals in New York'' shows Milk exuberant as a protester on  1971 in New York City. Milk met , 18 years his junior, and began another relationship. Milk and Smith returned to San Francisco, where they lived on money they had saved. In March 1973, after a roll of film Milk left at a local shop was ruined, he and Smith opened a camera store on Castro Street with their last $1,000.Shilts, p.&nbsp;65.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, the  (SIR) and the  (DOB) began to work against police persecution of s and  in San Francisco.  was still a , and in 1970, nearly 90&nbsp;people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800&nbsp;gay men were arrested for  in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a .Clendinen, p.&nbsp;154.\n\nCongressman , Assemblyman , and other California politicians recognized the growing clout and organization of homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings of gay and lesbian organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor  in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman  worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the , and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.\n\nSIR had become powerful enough for political maneuvering. In 1971 SIR members , Rick Stokes, and '''' publisher  formed the , known as simply \"Alice\". Alice befriended liberal politicians to persuade them to sponsor bills, proving successful in 1972 when  obtained Feinstein's support for an ordinance outlawing employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Alice chose Stokes to run for a relatively unimportant seat on the community college board. Though Stokes received 45,000&nbsp;votes, he was quiet and unassuming, and did not win. Foster, however, shot to national prominence by being the first openly gay man to address a political convention. His speech at the  ensured that his voice, according to San Francisco politicians, was the one to be heard when they wanted the opinions, and especially the votes, of the gay community.\n\nMilk became more interested in political and civic matters when he was faced with civic problems and policies he disliked. One day in 1973, a state bureaucrat entered Milk's shop  and informed him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was incredulous and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function. Friends also remember around the same time having to restrain him from kicking the television while   gave consistent \"I don't recall\" replies during the . Milk decided that the time had come to run for city supervisor. He said later, \"I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up\".\n\n\n\n\nMilk received an icy reception from the gay political establishment in San Francisco. Jim Foster, who had by then been active in gay politics for ten years, resented that the newcomer had asked for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, \"There's an old saying in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I've never seen you put up the chairs.\" Milk was furious that Foster had snubbed him for the position, and the conversation marked the beginning of an antagonistic relationship between the \"Alice\" Club and Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.\n\nMilk had drifted through life up to this point, but he found his vocation, according to journalist , who called him a \"born politician\".FitzGerald, Frances (July 21, 1986). \"A Reporter at Large: The Castro – I\", ''The New Yorker'', pp. 34–70. At first, his inexperience showed. He tried to do without money, support, or staff, and instead relied on his message of sound financial management, promoting individuals over large corporations and government. He supported the reorganization of supervisor elections from a citywide ballot to district ballots, which was intended to reduce the influence of money and give neighborhoods more control over their representatives in city government. He also ran on a culturally liberal platform, opposing government interference in private sexual matters and favoring the . Milk's fiery, flamboyant speeches and savvy media skills earned him a significant amount of press during the 1973 election. He earned 16,900 votessweeping the Castro District and other liberal neighborhoods and coming in 10th place out of 32 candidates. Had the elections been reorganized to allow districts to elect their own supervisors, he would have won.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom early in his political career, Milk displayed an affinity for building coalitions. The  wanted to strike against beer distributorswho refused to sign the union contract. An organizer asked Milk for assistance with gay bars; in return, Milk asked the union to hire more gay drivers. A few days later, Milk canvassed the gay bars in and surrounding the Castro District, urging them to refuse to sell the beer. With the help of a coalition of Arab and Chinese grocers the Teamsters had also recruited, the boycott was successful. Milk found a strong political ally in , and it was around this time that he began to style himself \"The Mayor of Castro Street\". As Castro Street's presence grew, so did Milk's reputation. Tom O'Horgan remarked, \"Harvey spent most of his life looking for a stage. On Castro Street he finally found it.\"\n\nTensions were growing between the older citizens of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays who were entering the Castro District. In 1973, two gay men tried to open an antique shop, but the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted to prevent them from receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the  in 1974 to attract more customers to the area.\"Harvey Bernard Milk\". ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.\n\n\nAlthough he was a newcomer to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting to be taken seriously as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another  again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. His store, Castro Camera, became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaignsmany discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.\n\nMilk favored support for small businesses and the growth of neighborhoods. Since 1968, Mayor  had been luring large corporations to the city despite what critics labeled \"the  of San Francisco\". As blue-collar jobs were replaced by the service industry, Alioto's weakened political base allowed for new leadership to be voted into office in the city. In 1975, state senator  was elected mayor. Moscone had been instrumental in repealing the sodomy law earlier that year in the California State Legislature. He acknowledged Milk's influence in his election by visiting Milk's election night headquarters, thanking Milk personally, and offering him a position as a city commissioner. Milk came in seventh place in the election, only one position away from earning a supervisor seat.\n\nDespite the new leadership in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. In one of Moscone's first acts as mayor, he appointed a police chief to the embattled  (SFPD). He chose , against the wishes of the SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes.Gain further alienated the SFPD by attending a raucous party in 1977 called the Hooker's Ball. The party grew out of control and Gain had to call in reinforcements to control the excesses, but a photograph ran in the papers of him holding a champagne bottle while standing beside  activist  and a drag queen named \"Wonder Whore\". (Weiss, pp.&nbsp;156–157.) By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.\n\n\n\n\nMilk's role as a representative of San Francisco's gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President , while visiting San Francisco, walked from his hotel to his car. In the crowd,  raised a gun to shoot him. A former  who had been walking by grabbed her arm as the gun discharged toward the pavement. The bystander was , who had left Milk's ex-lover Joe Campbell years before, prompting Campbell's suicide attempt. The incident drew great attention to Sipple. On psychiatric disability leave from the military, Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed., ''Time'' (October 6, 1975). Retrieved September 6, 2008. Milk, however, took advantage of the opportunity to illustrate his cause that the public perception of gay people would be improved if they came out of the closet. He told a friend: \"It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that ca-ca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms.\" Milk contacted a newspaper.Morain, Dan (February 13, 1989). \"Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight\", ''The Los Angeles Times'', p.&nbsp;1.\n\nSeveral days later, , a columnist at the '''', outed Sipple as gay and exposed him as a friend of Milk's. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk's name was included in many of the stories. '''' magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco's gay community. Sipple was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch  in Detroit, refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the ''Chronicle'' for invasion of privacy. President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk claimed that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the .Sipple's case was eventually rejected in 1984 in a California court of appeals. Sipple, who was wounded in the head in Vietnam, was also diagnosed as having . He held no ill will toward Milk, however, and remained in contact with him. The incident's significance brought so much attention that, later in life while drinking, he stated that he regretted having grabbed Moore's gun. Eventually, Sipple regained contact with his mother and brother, but continued to be rejected by his father. He kept the letter written by Ford, framed, in his apartment, until he died of pneumonia in 1989. (\"Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President's Life\", ''The Los Angeles Times'', [February 13, 1989], p. 1.)\n\n\nKeeping his promise to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone appointed him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk considered seeking a position in the . The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.\n\n.]]\n\nMilk spent five weeks on the Board of Permit Appeals before Moscone was forced to fire him when he announced he would run for the California State Assembly. Rick Stokes replaced him. Milk's firing, and the backroom deal made between Moscone, the assembly speaker, and Agnos, fueled his campaign as he took on the identity of a political underdog.Shilts, pp. 133–137. He railed that high officers in the city and state governments were against him. He complained that the prevailing gay political establishment, particularly the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club, were shutting him out; he referred to Jim Foster and Stokes as gay \"s\". He enthusiastically embraced a local independent weekly magazine's headline: \"Harvey Milk vs. The Machine\". The Alice B. Toklas Club made no endorsement in the primaryneither Milk nor Agnoswhile other gay-aligned clubs and groups endorsed Agnos or did dual endorsements.\n\nMilk's continuing campaign, run from the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned with the man who was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.\n\nIf the candidate was manic, he was also dedicated and filled with good humor, and he had a particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding \"Milk for Assembly\" signs while commuters drove into the heart of the city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including one of the most influential political groups in the city, the . Milk accepted Temple volunteers to work his phones. On February 19, 1978, Milk wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending cult leader  as \"a man of the highest character\" when asked.Milk, Harvey. February 19, 1978. \" .\" Milk's relationship with the Temple was similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to ''The San Francisco Examiner'', Jones and his parishioners were a \"potent political force\", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney , and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, \"Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays.\" But to his volunteers, he said: \"Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask you to do something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it.\"\n\nThe race was close, and Milk lost by fewer than 4,000 votes. Agnos taught Milk a valuable lesson when he criticized Milk's campaign speeches as \"a downer&nbsp;... You talk about how you're gonna throw the bums out, but how are you gonna fix thingsother than beat me? You shouldn't leave your audience on a down.\" In the wake of his loss, Milk, realizing that the Toklas Club would never support him politically, co-founded the .\n\n\nThe fledgling gay rights movement had yet to meet organized opposition in the US. In 1977 a few well-connected gay activists in Miami, Florida, were able to pass a civil rights ordinance that made discrimination based on sexual orientation illegal in . A well-organized group of conservative  responded, headed by singer . Their campaign was titled , and Bryant claimed the ordinance infringed her right to teach her children Biblical morality.Fetner, Tina (August 2001). \"Working Anita Bryant: The Impact of Christian Anti-Gay Activism on Lesbian and Gay Movement Claims\", ''Social Problems'', '''48''' (3), pp. 411–428.   Bryant and the campaign gathered 64,000 signatures to put the issue to a county-wide vote. With funds raised in part by the Florida Citrus Commission, for which Bryant was the spokeswoman, they ran television advertisements that contrasted the  with , stating that Dade County would be turned into a \"hotbed of homosexuality\" where \"men&nbsp;... cavort with little boys\".Bryant agreed to an interview with '''' magazine, in which she was quoted saying that the civil rights ordinance \"would have made it mandatory that flaunting homosexuals be hired in both the public and parochial schools&nbsp;... If they're a legitimate minority, then so are nail biters, dieters, fat people, short people, and murderers.\" (\"Playboy Interview: Anita Bryant\", ''Playboy'', (May 1978), pp.&nbsp;73–96, 232–250.) Bryant would often break into her standard \"\" while speaking during the campaign, called homosexuals \"human garbage\", and blamed the drought in California on their sins. (Clendinen, p.&nbsp;306.) As the special election drew near, a Florida state senator read the  aloud to the Senate, and the governor went on record against the civil rights ordinance. (Duberman, p. 320.)\n\nJim Foster, then the most powerful political organizer in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide  was organized. The message of the Save Our Children campaign was influential, and the result was an overwhelming defeat for gay activists; in the largest turnout in any special election in the history of Dade County, 70% voted to repeal the law.\n\n\nChristian conservatives were inspired by their victory, and saw an opportunity for a new, effective political cause. Gay activists were shocked to see how little support they received. An impromptu demonstration of over 3,000 Castro residents formed the night of the Dade County ordinance vote. Gay men and lesbians were simultaneously angry, chanting \"Out of the bars and into the streets!\", and elated at their passionate and powerful response. ''The San Francisco Examiner'' reported that members of the crowd pulled others out of bars along Castro and Polk Streets to \"deafening\" cheers. Milk led marchers that night on a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) course through the city, constantly moving, aware that if they stopped for too long there would be a riot. He declared, \"This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force.\"Sharpe, Ivan (June 8, 1977). \"Angry Gays March Through S.F.\", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p.&nbsp;1. Activists had little time to recover, however, as the scenario replayed itself when civil rights ordinances were overturned by voters in ; ; and , throughout 1977 and into 1978.\n\nCalifornia State Senator  saw an opportunity in the Christian fundamentalists' campaign. He was hoping to be elected governor of California in 1978, and was impressed with the voter turnout he saw in Miami. When Briggs returned to , he wrote a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools throughout California. Briggs claimed in private that he had nothing against gays, telling gay journalist , \"It's politics. Just politics.\" Random attacks on gays rose in the Castro. When the police response was considered inadequate, groups of gays patrolled the neighborhood themselves, on alert for attackers.Hinckle, p. 15. On June 21, 1977, a gay man named  died from 15 stab wounds while his attackers gathered around him and chanted \"Faggot!\" Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough's mother blamed Anita Bryant and John Briggs. One week prior to the incident, Briggs had held a press conference at  where he called the city a \"sexual garbage heap\" because of homosexuals. Weeks later, 250,000 people attended the 1977 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, the largest attendance at any Gay Pride event to that point.\n\nIn November 1976, voters in San Francisco decided to reorganize supervisor elections to choose supervisors from neighborhoods instead of voting for them in citywide ballots. Harvey Milk quickly qualified as the leading candidate in District 5, surrounding Castro Street.\n\n\n\n\nAnita Bryant's public campaign opposing homosexuality and the multiple challenges to gay rights ordinances across the United States fueled gay politics in San Francisco. Seventeen candidates from the Castro District entered the next race for supervisor; more than half of them were gay. '''' ran an exposé on the veritable invasion of gay people into San Francisco, estimating that the city's gay population was between 100,000 and 200,000 out of a total 750,000.Gold, Herbert (November 6, 1977), , ''The New York Times'', p.&nbsp;SM17. The Castro Village Association had grown to 90 businesses; the local bank, formerly the smallest branch in the city, had become the largest and was forced to build a wing to accommodate its new customers. Milk biographer Randy Shilts noted that his campaign was fueled by \"broader historical forces\".\n\nMilk's most successful opponent was the quiet and thoughtful lawyer Rick Stokes, who was backed by the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Stokes was open about his homosexuality long before Milk had, and had experienced more severe treatment, once hospitalized and forced to endure  to 'cure' him. Milk, however, was more expressive about the role of gay people and their issues in San Francisco politics. Stokes was quoted saying, \"I'm just a businessman who happens to be gay,\" and expressed the view that any normal person could also be homosexual. Milk's contrasting populist philosophy was relayed to ''The New York Times'': \"We don't want sympathetic liberals, we want gays to represent gays&nbsp;... I represent the gay street peoplethe 14-year-old runaway from . We have to make up for hundreds of years of persecution. We have to give hope to that poor runaway kid from San Antonio. They go to the bars because churches are hostile. They need hope! They need a piece of the pie!\"\n\nOther causes were also important to Milk: he promoted larger and less expensive child care facilities, free public transportation, and the development of a board of civilians to oversee the police. He advanced important neighborhood issues at every opportunity. Milk used the same manic campaign tactics as in previous races: human billboards, hours of handshaking, and dozens of speeches calling on gay people to have hope. This time, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' endorsed him for supervisor. On election day, November 8, 1977, he won by 30% against sixteen other candidates, and after his victory became apparent, he arrived on Castro Street on the back of his campaign manager's motorcycleescorted by Sheriff to what a newspaper story described as a \"tumultuous and moving welcome\".\n\nMilk had recently taken a new lover, a young man named Jack Lira, who was frequently drunk in public, and just as often escorted out of political events by Milk's aides. Since the race for the California State Assembly, Milk was receiving increasingly violent death threats. Concerned that his raised profile marked him as a target for assassination, he recorded on tape his thoughts, and whom he wanted to succeed him if he were killed, adding: \"If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door\".\n\n\nMilk's swearing-in made national headlines, as he became the first non-incumbent openly gay man in the United States to win an election for public office.Cone, Russ (January 8, 1978). \"Feinstein Board President\", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p.&nbsp;1.Two gay politicians were already in office: lesbian Massachusetts State Representative  and Minnesota State Senator , who had come out after he had been elected and won re-election. He likened himself to pioneering African American baseball player  and walked to City Hall arm in arm with Jack Lira, stating \"You can stand around and throw bricks at Silly Hall or you can take it over. Well, here we are.\" The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (), a Chinese American (), and an African American woman ()all firsts for the city. , a former police officer and firefighter, was also a first-time supervisor, and he spoke of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.Ledbetter, Les (January 12, 1978). , ''The New York Times'', Vol. 127, no. 43818. p. A14.\n\n\nMilk's energy, affinity for pranking, and unpredictability at times exasperated Board of Supervisors President Dianne Feinstein. In his first meeting with Mayor Moscone, Milk called himself the \"number one queen\" and dictated to Moscone that he would have to go through Milk instead of the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club if he wanted the city's gay votesa quarter of San Francisco's voting population. Milk also became Moscone's closest ally on the Board of Supervisors. The biggest targets of Milk's ire were large corporations and real estate developers. He fumed when a parking garage was slated to take the place of homes near the downtown area, and tried to pass a commuter tax so office workers who lived outside the city and drove into work would have to pay for city services they used. Milk was often willing to vote against Feinstein and other more tenured members of the board. In one controversy early in his term, Milk agreed with fellow Supervisor Dan White, whose district was located two miles south of the Castro, that a mental health facility for troubled adolescents should not be placed there. After Milk learned more about the facility, he decided to switch his vote, ensuring White's loss on the issuea particularly poignant cause that White championed while campaigning. White did not forget it. He opposed every initiative and issue Milk supported.\n\nMilk began his tenure by sponsoring a civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation.  The ordinance was called the \"most stringent and encompassing in the nation\", and its passing demonstrated \"the growing political power of homosexuals\", according to ''The New York Times''. Only Supervisor White voted against it; Mayor Moscone enthusiastically signed it into law with a light blue pen that Milk had given him for the occasion.\n\nAnother bill Milk concentrated on was designed to solve the number one problem according to a recent citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the \"pooper scooper law\", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him \"a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper\".''The Times of Harvey Milk''. Dir. Rob Epstein. DVD, Pacific Arts, 1984. He invited the press to  to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in front of the cameras. It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.\n\nMilk had grown tired of Lira's drinking and considered breaking up with him when Lira called a few weeks later and demanded Milk come home. When Milk arrived, he found Lira had hanged himself. Already prone to severe depression, Lira had attempted suicide previously. One of the notes he left for Milk indicated he was upset about the Anita Bryant and John Briggs campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nJohn Briggs was forced to drop out of the 1978 race for California governor, but received enthusiastic support for Proposition 6, dubbed the . The proposed law would have made firing gay teachersand any public school employees who supported gay rightsmandatory. Briggs' messages supporting Proposition 6 were pervasive throughout California, and Harvey Milk attended every event Briggs hosted. Milk campaigned against the bill throughout the state as well,VanDeCarr, Paul (November 23, 2003). \"Death of dreams: in November 1978, Harvey Milk's murder and the mass suicides at Jonestown nearly broke San Francisco's spirit.\", ''The Advocate'', p. 32. and swore that if Briggs won California, he would still not win San Francisco. In their numerous debates, which toward the end had been honed to quick back-and-forth banter, Briggs maintained that homosexual teachers wanted to abuse and recruit children. Milk responded with statistics compiled by law enforcement that provided evidence that s identified primarily as heterosexual, and dismissed Briggs' assertions with one-liner jokes: \"If it were true that children mimicked their teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around.\"\n\nAttendance at Gay Pride marches during the summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An estimated 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying \"I'm from \" He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the \"Hope Speech\", that ''The San Francisco Examiner'' said \"ignited the crowd\":Jacobs, John (June 26, 1978). \"An Ecumenical Alliance on the Serious Side of 'Gay' \", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p.&nbsp;3.\n\nOn this anniversary of , I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country&nbsp;... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets&nbsp;... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.\n\nDespite the losses in battles for gay rights across the country that year, he remained optimistic, saying \"Even if gays lose in these initiatives, people are still being educated. Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality to a greater extent than ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you can sit down and talk about it.\"Giteck, Lenny (November 28, 1978). \"Milk Knew He Would Be Assassinated\", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 2.\n\nCiting the potential infringements on individual rights, former governor of California  voiced his opposition to the proposition, as did Governor  and President , the latter in an afterthought following a speech he gave in Sacramento.Clendinen, pp. 388–389. On November 7, 1978, the proposition lost by more than a million votes, astounding gay activists on election night. In San Francisco, 75 percent voted against it.\n\n\n\n\nOn November 10, 1978 (10 months after he was sworn in),  resigned his position on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, saying that his annual salary of $9,600 ()  was not enough to support his family.\"Mayor Hunts a Successor for White\", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', (November 11, 1978), p.&nbsp;1.Despite White's financial strain, he had recently voted against a pay raise for city supervisors that would have given him a $24,000 annual salary. (Cone, Russ [November 14, 1978]. \"Increase in City Supervisors' Pay Is Proposed Again\", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 4.) Feinstein pointed him toward commercial developers at  near  where he and his wife set up a walk-up restaurant called The Hot Potato. (Weiss, pp. 143–146.)  in the Castro District was fully apparent in the late 1970s. In Milk's public rants about \"bloodsucking\" real estate developers, he used his landlord (who was gay) as an example. Not amused, his landlord tripled the rent for the storefront and the apartment above, where Milk lived. (Shilts, pp. 227–228.) Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed.Ledbetter, Les (November 29, 1978). , ''The New York Times'', Vol. 128, no. 44051. p.&nbsp;1. However, further considerationand intervention by other supervisorsconvinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors., ''Time'', December 11, 1978.

California Representative  was in  to check on the remote community, and he was killed by gunfire at an airstrip as he tried to escape the tense situation. White remarked to two aides who were working for his reinstatement, \"You see that? One day I'm on the front page and the next I'm swept right off.\"\n\nMoscone planned to announce White's replacement on November 27, 1978.Flintwick, James (November 28, 1978). \"Aide: White 'A Wild Man, ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 1. A half hour before the press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head.Turner, Wallace (November 28, 1978). , ''The New York Times'', Vol. 128, no. 44050. p.&nbsp;1. White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with s along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment.  heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk face down on the floor, shot five times, including twice in the head.Though Feinstein was known to carry a handgun in her purse, she afterwards became a proponent of gun control. In 1993, Feinstein exchanged words with  senator , who suggested during a debate on banning s that \"the gentlelady from California\" should be \"a little bit more familiar with firearms and their deadly characteristics.\" She reminded Craig that she indeed had experience with the results of firearms when she put her finger in a bullet hole in Milk's neck while searching for a pulse. (Faye, Fiore [April 24, 1995]. \"Rematch on Weapons Ban Takes Shape in Congress Arms: Feinstein prepares to defend the prohibition on assault guns as GOP musters forces to repeal it\", ''The Los Angeles Times'', p. 3.) Soon after, she announced to the press, \"Today, San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty to inform you that both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White.\" Milk was 48&nbsp;years old. Moscone was 49.\n\nWithin an hour, White called his wife from a nearby diner; she met him at a church and was with him when he turned himself in. Many people left flowers on the steps of City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a spontaneous candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at .

Cult survivors recounted drills for suicide preparations that Jones had called \"White Nights\". Rumors about the murders of Moscone and Milk were fueled by the coincidence of Dan White's name and Jones's suicide preparations. A stunned District Attorney called the assassinations so close to the news about Jonestown \"incomprehensible\", but denied any connection. Governor  ordered all flags in California to be flown at , and called Milk a \"hard-working and dedicated supervisor, a leader of San Francisco's gay community, who kept his promise to represent all his constituents\".\"Reaction: World Coming Apart\", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', (November 28, 1978), p. 2. President  expressed his shock at both murders and sent his condolences. Speaker of the California Assembly  called it \"an insane tragedy\". \"A City in Agony\" topped the headlines in ''The San Francisco Examiner'' the day after the murders; inside the paper stories of the assassinations under the headline \"Black Monday\" were printed back to back with updates of bodies being shipped home from Guyana. An editorial describing \"A city with more sadness and despair in its heart than any city should have to bear\" went on to ask how such tragedies could occur, particularly to \"men of such warmth and vision and great energies\". Dan White was charged with two counts of murder and held without bail, eligible for the death penalty owing to the recent passage of a statewide proposition that allowed death or life in prison for the murder of a public official. One analysis of the months surrounding the murders called 1978 and 1979: \"the most emotionally devastating years in San Francisco's fabulously spotted history\".\n\nThe 32-year-old White, who had been in the Army during the , had run on a tough anti-crime platform in his district. Colleagues declared him a high-achieving \"all-American boy\". He was to have received an award the next week for rescuing a woman and child from a 17-story burning building when he was a firefighter in 1977. Though he was the only supervisor to vote against Milk's gay rights ordinance earlier that year, he had been quoted as saying, \"I respect the rights of all people, including gays\". Milk and White at first got along well. One of White's political aides (who was gay) remembered, \"Dan had more in common with Harvey than he did with anyone else on the board\".Geluardi, John (January 30, 2008).  , ''SF Weekly''. Retrieved September 11, 2008. White had voted to support a center for gay seniors, and to honor 's 25th anniversary and pioneering work.\n\n\n\nAfter Milk's vote for the mental health facility in White's district, however, White refused to speak with Milk and communicated with only one of Milk's aides. Other acquaintances remembered White as very intense. \"He was impulsive&nbsp;... He was an extremely competitive man, obsessively so&nbsp;... I think he could not take defeat,\" San Francisco's assistant fire chief told reporters.Carlsen, William (November 29, 1978). , ''The New York Times'', Vol. 128, no. 44051. p.&nbsp;A22. White's first campaign manager quit in the middle of the campaign, and told a reporter that White was an  and it was clear that he was antigay, though he denied it in the press.Hinckle, p. 30. White's associates and supporters described him \"as a man with a pugilistic temper and an impressive capacity for nurturing a grudge\". The aide who had handled communications between White and Milk remembered, \"Talking to him, I realized that he saw Harvey Milk and George Moscone as representing all that was wrong with the world\".\n\nWhen Milk's friends looked in his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been affected by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart and all of his socks had holes. His remains were cremated and his ashes were split. His closest friends scattered most of the ashes in . Other ashes were encapsulated and buried beneath the sidewalk in front of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk at the , ground floor, San Francisco, California. , one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.\n\n\n\n\nDan White's arrest and trial caused a sensation and illustrated severe tensions between the liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration as well as the liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he sat in his cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore \"Free Dan White\" T-shirts in the days after the murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: \"The more I observed what went on at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement.\" White showed no remorse for his actions, and exhibited vulnerability only during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.\n\nThe jury for White's trial consisted of white middle-class San Franciscans who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused from the jury pool. Some of the members of the jury cried when they heard White's tearful recorded confession, at the end of which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty.Hinckle, p. 49. White's defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that his client was not responsible for his actions; Schmidt used the legal defense known as : \"Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don't kill people in cold blood.\" Schmidt tried to prove that White's anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again. Schmidt said that White's  mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk food binge the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious.Mounts, Suzanne (Spring 1999). \"Malice Aforethought in California: A History of Legislative Abdication and Judicial Vacillation\", ''University of San Francisco Law Review'' (33 U.S.F.

He cried when he heard the verdict.\n\n\n\n, May 21, 1979, reacting to the  verdict for .]]\n\nActing Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk's successor Harry Britt condemned the jury's decision. When the verdict was announced over the police radio, someone sang \"\" on the police band. A surge of people from the Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting \"Avenge Harvey Milk\" and \"He got away with murder\". Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter's question about why they were destroying parts of the city: \"Just tell people that we ate too many Twinkies. That's why this is happening.\" The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The , as they became known, lasted several hours.\n\nLater that evening, several police cruisers filled with officers wearing riot gear arrived at the Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's   and a reporter for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar and struck out at people walking along the street.\n\nAfter the verdict, District Attorney Joseph Freitas faced a furious gay community to explain what had gone wrong. The prosecutor admitted to feeling sorry for White before the trial, and neglected to ask the interrogator who had recorded White's confession (and who was a childhood friend of White's and his police softball team coach) about his biases and the support White received from the police because, he said, he did not want to embarrass the detective in front of his family in court. Nor did Freitas question White's frame of mind or lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive. Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver testified on the last day of the trial that White and Milk were not friendly, yet she had contacted the prosecutor and insisted on testifying. It was the only testimony the jury heard about their strained relationship. Freitas blamed the jury who he claimed had been \"taken in by the whole emotional aspect of [the] trial\".\n\n\nThe murders of Milk and Moscone and White's trial changed city politics and the California legal system. In 1980, San Francisco ended district supervisor elections, fearing that a Board of Supervisors so divisive would be harmful to the city and that they had been a factor in the assassinations. A grassroots neighborhood effort to restore district elections in the mid-1990s proved successful, and the city returned to neighborhood representatives in 2000. As a result of Dan White's trial, California voters changed the law to reduce the likelihood of acquittals of accused who knew what they were doing but claimed their capacity was impaired. Diminished capacity was abolished as a defense to a charge, but courts allowed evidence of it when deciding whether to incarcerate, commit, or otherwise punish a convicted defendant. The \"Twinkie defense\" has entered American mythology, popularly described as a case where a murderer escapes justice because he binged on junk food, simplifying White's lack of political savvy, his relationships with George Moscone and Harvey Milk, and what ''San Francisco Chronicle'' columnist  described as his \"dislike of homosexuals\".\n\nDan White served just over five years for the double homicide of Moscone and Milk; he was released from prison on January 7, 1984. On October 21, 1985, White was found dead in a running car in his wife's garage, having committed suicide by  poisoning. He was 39&nbsp;years old. His defense attorney told reporters that he had been despondent over the loss of his family and the situation he had caused, adding, \"This was a sick man.\"Lindsey, Robert (October 22, 1985). , ''The New York Times'', Vol. 135, no. 46570. p. A18.\n\n\n\nMilk's political career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, and the importance of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy.Foss, Karen (1988). \"You Have to Give Them Hope\", ''Journal of the West'', '''27''' pp. 75–81.  His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Franciscoa city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal governmenthis interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide the fact that he was gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.\n\nMilk strongly believed that neighborhoods promoted unity and a small-town experience, and that the Castro should provide services to all its residents. He opposed the closing of an elementary school; while most gay people in the Castro did not have children, Milk saw his neighborhood having the potential to welcome everyone. He told his aides to concentrate on fixing s and boasted that 50 new stop signs had been installed in District 5. Responding to city residents' largest complaint about living in San Franciscodog fecesMilk made it a priority to enact the ordinance requiring dog owners to take care of their pets' droppings. Randy Shilts noted, \"some would claim Harvey was a socialist or various other sorts of ideologues, but, in reality, Harvey's political philosophy was never more complicated than the issue of dogshit; government should solve people's basic problems.\"\n\n\nKaren Foss, a communications professor at the , attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics to the fact that he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, \"Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose&nbsp;... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies.\"Foss, Karen. \"The Logic of Folly in the Political Campaigns of Harvey Milk\", in ''Queer Words, Queer Images'', Jeffrey Ringer, ed. (1994), New York University Press. . . Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the \"Hope Speech\", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: \"My name is Harvey Milkand I want to recruit you.\" A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective:\n\nAnd the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.\n\nIn the last year of his life, Milk emphasized that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and . Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so:\n\nI cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects&nbsp;... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.\n\nHowever, Milk's assassination has become entwined with his political efficacy, partly because he was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, \"No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death.\"Miller, p. 408. His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was \"a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America\".Shilts, p. 348. According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend has been unable to be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: \"The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him a great deal of the Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one.\"FitzGerald, Frances (July 28, 1986). \"A Reporter at Large: The CastroII\", ''The New Yorker'', pp. 44–63. On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian  said, \"The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity.\"Cloud, John (November 10, 1998). \"Why Milk is Still Fresh: Twenty Years After his Assassination, Harvey Milk Still Has a Lot to Offer the Gay Life\", ''The Advocate'', (772) p. 29. For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: \"His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process.\"\n\n\n\n above Harvey Milk Plaza in ]]\n\nThe City of San Francisco has paid tribute to Milk by naming several locations after him.The Harvey Milk Recreational Arts Center is headquarters for the drama and performing arts programs for the city's youth.

In September 2020, Hewitt introduced legislation to establish restrictions specific to Riverside County, which would've been looser than those set by the state. The legislation would've allowed some indoor services that had been ordered closed to reopen with capacity limits, including restaurants, gyms, hair salons, places of worship, movie theaters, libraries, and retailers. Hewitt's proposal would have reopened the County fully by November 3, with large events being permitted starting on October 13. Due to a threat by   to cut state funding to counties that did not follow his guidelines for reopening, Hewitt's plan had the potential to cost Riverside County between $28 million and $656 million in state funding. Hewitt argued that the additional tax revenue gained from reopening the County would offset any loss of state funds. On September 22, the Board of Supervisors voted 3–2 to advance Hewitt's proposal, but delayed its implementation to October. On October 6, the Board voted 4–1 to enact a modified version of Hewitt's plan, with Hewitt as the sole opposing vote.

Using sensors that, when armed, would detect motion and pressure on the car's body, his device made loud noise to draw attention to a would-be car thief, such as the car's horn honking or a speaker playing a recording with Issa's voice saying: \"Protected by Viper. Stand back\" and \"Please step away from the car\", warnings for DEI's signature product, the Viper car alarm. Sales grew from $1 million in the company's first year to $14 million by 1989.\n\n\n\nIssa is partner in 17 limited partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) that own commercial properties across North San Diego County. He is CEO of Greene Properties, Inc., a privately held real estate investment company with commercial real estate holdings in San Diego North County. Headquartered in Vista, it manages three commercial office buildings in  with a total of 26,354 square feet. Employees include his wife and son William \"Will\" Issa as assistant property manager. The office is in the same building as Issa's former congressional office, near their house of the last 20 years.\n\n\n\n\nActive in  s, Issa became more directly involved in politics. He went to  to lobby Congress and later became one of California's biggest individual s to Republican candidates. In 1996, he chaired the successful campaign to pass , a  that prohibited Californian  from considering race, sex, or ethnicity in public employment, public contracting, or . He was instrumental in persuading the national Republican Party to hold  in San Diego.\n\n\n\nIssa's first campaign for elected office was in 1998, when he sought the Republican nomination for  to face incumbent  . He spent $10 million of his own money in the primary, running against  , Congressman , and three others. Fong's campaign raised $3 million from contributions and complained that Issa's wealth made for an uneven playing field (Issa received only $400,000 in contributions from others). An Issa spokesman countered that the money was needed to compensate for Fong's statewide name recognition. Issa lost to Fong, 45% to 40%; Riggs got 10% of the vote. A San Francisco exit poll suggested large numbers of Asian Americans, who typically vote in the Democratic primary, had crossed party lines to strategically vote for Fong.\n\n\n  in 2001]] \n  deliver remarks before signing the ]]\n\n\n\n\nNine-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman  decided not to run for reelection in 2000, in . Issa ran for the seat, capitalizing on his name recognition from the 1998 Senate race. The district was primarily based in  , but had small portions in  and  counties. Issa finished first in the all-party primary with 35% of the vote, winning a plurality in all three counties; Republican   was second, with 24% of the votes. Issa won the November general election, defeating Democratic nominee Peter Kouvelis 61%–28%.\n\n\n\nAfter redistricting, Issa's district was renumbered the 49th and lost its share of Orange County. Like its predecessor, the district was still overwhelmingly Republican; it had a  of R+10. No Democrat filed against Issa that year. He was reelected, defeating Libertarian nominee Karl Dietrich, 77%–22%.\n\n\n\nA  from the 2002 election, Mike Byron, became the Democratic challenger in 2004. Issa was reelected to a third term, defeating Byron 63%–35%.\n\n\n\nIssa was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Democratic nominee Jeeni Criscenzo, 63%–33%. He was one of four  members in that Congress. He has said that he identified primarily as Lebanese, not as pan-Arab.\n\n\n\nIssa was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Democratic nominee Robert Hamilton, 58%–37%. The 21-point margin of victory was the second smallest in Issa's career. He carried San Diego with 60% of the vote and Riverside with 57% of the vote.\n\n\n\nIssa was reelected to a sixth term, defeating Democratic nominee Howard Katz, 63%–31%.\n\n\n\nAfter the 2010 census, Issa's district was renumbered the 49th and made significantly more compact. It lost its share of Riverside County, along with most of its share of San Diego County. It gained a small portion of southern Orange County, including , , , and part of . The district was more competitive on paper than its predecessor. The old 49th had a PVI of R+10, while the new 49th has a PVI of R+4.\n\nIssa was reelected to a seventh term, defeating Democratic nominee Jerry Tetalman, 58%–42%. The 16-point margin of victory was the smallest in Issa's political career. Issa carried the San Diego portion of his district with 55% of the vote and the Orange County part with 66%.\n\n\n\nThe June open primary was contested by Issa and two Democrats: Dave Peiser and Noboru Isaga. The top two vote-getters, Issa (62%) and Peiser (28%), advanced to the general election. Issa was elected to an eighth term, 60% to 40%.\n\n\n\nIn the June open primary, Issa received 51% of the vote to 46% for Democrat , a retired Marine colonel. Issa and Applegate advanced to the general election in November. In October, Applegate and Issa were ranked by the  as equally likely to win.\n\nIssa sent out a campaign mailer that featured a photograph of President  signing a law. The mailer said that Issa was \"very pleased\" that Obama signed the , which Issa had co-sponsored.\n\nUnusually, President Obama responded to this late campaign mailer by saying that Issa's \"primary contribution to the U.S. Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped up investigations that have led nowhere.\" Obama said that, because of fading support for , Issa was promoting his cooperation with the president although he had previously accused Obama of corruption.\n\nIssa said, \"I've worked with the administration on good legislation where it was possible, called out wrongdoing wherever I saw it and will continue to do so.\"\n\nOn November 23, 2016, Issa held a 3,234-vote lead with approximately 6,000 ballots still uncounted. He declared victory, but Applegate had not conceded. The  finally declared Issa the winner on November 28, citing a small but convincing lead with only a few votes left to count.\n\n\n\nMultiple Democrats, including Applegate and environmental attorney , launched campaigns for California's 49th district seat. Given the close margin in 2016, the election was expected to be highly competitive. For months, Issa's Vista office was the site of weekly protests. Hundreds of people gathered to protest against Trump and his agenda and actions. At a May rally, 800 people showed up to protest the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). On January 10, 2018, Issa announced that he would not run for reelection. Democrat Mike Levin won the seat.\n\n\n\nOn September 26, 2019, Issa announced that he was running for  in the . The incumbent at that time was fellow Republican , who was then under indictment. In December 2019, Hunter pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and resigned from Congress effective January 13, 2020, leaving the seat vacant.\n\nIn redistricting, the 50th district had absorbed much of Issa's former base in the more Republican inland portion of San Diego County. Issa placed second in the March 3, 2020, blanket primary and beat Democratic challenger  by nearly 30,000 votes in the general election. Issa said he could switch districts because he owns his mother's home in . He has long lived in , where he has raised his family.\n\n\n\nAfter the 2010 elections, Issa became chair of the . He was a vocal advocate for investigations into the , including the , the , corruption in , , and the , among other topics. In 2010 he told the press that he wanted the committee to hold investigative hearings \"seven hearings a week, times 40 weeks.\"\n\nIn February 2011, the , a nonprofit investigative reporting center based at , published an investigation alleging that as leader of the committee, Issa built a team that included staff members with close connections to industries that could benefit from his investigations.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the committee held a hearing on the 's , which Issa believed to be a violation of the religious freedom of people who oppose the use of birth control. Democratic members submitted attorney and activist  as a witness for promoting women's health, but Issa did not permit her to testify, saying her name was submitted too late, a claim Democrats challenged.\n\n\nIn 2013 Issa introduced the . H.R. 2061 aimed to make information on federal expenditures more easily available, accessible, and transparent. President Obama signed the bill into law on May 9, 2014.\n\nIssa introduced the  on March 15, 2013, a bill to amend the  in order to make it easier and faster to request and receive information. The bill would have required the  to create a single FOIA website for people to use to make FOIA requests and check on the status of their request. It would also have created a Chief FOIA Officers Council charged with reviewing compliance and recommending improvements, and required the federal agency to release the information it disclosed to the person who requested it publicly afterward.\n\nIssa argued in favor of the bill because it \"shifts the burden of proof from the public requestor seeking information about a government agency...to the government being open and transparent unless it has a good reason to withhold.\" The bill passed the House unanimously on February 25, 2014, but a nearly identical Senate bill failed when it was tabled by House Speaker .\n\nIssa introduced the  on March 18, 2013, to make changes and reforms to the framework that manages how the federal government buys new technology. One of the requirements would be that the government develop a streamlined plan for its acquisitions. The bill would increase the power of federal agencies' s (CIO) so that they could be more effective.\n\nEach agency would also be reduced to having only one CIO, who would be responsible for the success and failure of the agency's IT projects. The bill would also require the federal government to make use of private sector best practices. The bill was intended to reduce IT procurement-related waste. It passed the House in a  on February 25, 2014. In December 2014 it passed as a section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Issa also introduced and co-sponsored  (Pub.L. 113–283, S. 2521; commonly referred to as FISMA Reform), which Obama signed into law on December 18, 2014.\n\nOn May 7, 2014, Issa introduced a  in the House (which passed 231 - 187): . The resolution holds , one of the central  officials involved in the , in  for her refusal to testify about the scandal before Issa's committee in response to a subpoena.\n\nIn July 2017, Issa introduced  to Congress in a bipartisan effort to empower artists by collecting royalties for the preceding three-year period and also by ensuring their creative rights remain in force for pre-1972 recordings just as newer artists are guaranteed by current legislation. Issa has been a consistent cosponsor of the Fair Play Fair Pay Act as well; granting radio performance rights for musicians and s.\n\n\nIn 2001, Issa's San Clemente district office was targeted in an .  leader  was arrested along with  in connection with the plot, which reportedly had focused on other targets before shifting to Issa's office. Issa speculated that the cause of the incident may have been a column written by political commentator  in which she charged that Issa sympathized with  despite its being listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization, charges he denied.\n\n\nIn September 2011, a liberal advocacy and lobbying group, American Family Voices, filed a complaint with the  against Issa, alleging he had repeatedly used his position of authority on the Oversight Committee to improperly intervene in dealings with , , and , all of which Issa is associated with in some way. Issa's office rejected the allegations.\n\nThe year before, the , a government watchdog group, gave Issa its Good Government Award for his contributions to government oversight and transparency. These included publicizing documents produced by the  in response to a congressional subpoena, publicly exposing the NYFR's secret \"back-door bailout\" of 's counterparties, and cofounding a Transparency Caucus dedicated to \"promoting a more open and accountable government through education, legislation, and oversight.\" In 2012 Issa featured in 's list of \"The 20 Most Innovative People in Democracy.\"\n\nIn late February 2021, Issa and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and , citing the ongoing , while actually attending the , which was held at the same time as their slated absences.

He was criticized for making comments that the federal government \"'just threw' buckets of cash at New York for an attack 'that had no dirty bomb in it, it had no chemical munitions in it'\" and asking \"why the firefighters who went there and everybody in the city of New York needs to come to the federal government for the dollars versus this being primarily a state consideration.\"Sisk, Richard and Michael McCauliff (April 3, 2008).  , ''New York Daily News''; accessed November 11, 2016. In September 2009, Issa's office released a statement indicating that his comments had been misrepresented and that the questions he asked concerned the then still unpassed bill H.R. 3543, which, according to the statement, \"would give U.S. taxpayer dollars to those who did not suffer physical injury and did not work at or around Ground Zero.\"\n\n\nIssa came to national prominence in 2003 when he contributed more than $1.6 million to help fund a signature-gathering drive for the petition to  California Governor . At the time he made the contribution, it was widely believed that Issa intended to run to replace Davis. But after fellow Republican  entered the race two days before the filing deadline, Issa announced that he would not run. He later said his mission had been accomplished with Davis's recall and that he wanted to continue to represent his district in Congress and work toward Middle East peace. At one point in the campaign he suggested people should vote against recalling Davis unless one of the two leading Republican contenders dropped out, concerned that Schwarzenegger and fellow Republican  would split votes, resulting in Democratic lieutenant governor 's election. Issa endorsed Schwarzenegger, who won the governorship when Davis was recalled.\n\n\nIssa voted against an amendment, which ultimately failed narrowly, that stated that religious corporations, associations and institutions that receive federal contracts cannot be discriminated against on the basis of religion. Democrats warn that such a provision could potentially allow discrimination against the LGBT community in the name of religious freedom.\n\n\n\nIssa attracted attention for his close relationship with and strong support for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. He endorsed Trump in March 2016. When the  surfaced, Issa condemned Trump's remarks but did not rescind his endorsement.\n\nIn early February 2017, Issa expressed his support for a special prosecutor to look into Trump's ties to Russia. On February 27, he walked back his previous comments. Issa supported Trump's dismissal of FBI Director , saying \"Comey had lost my confidence long ago.\"\n\nIssa said he believed Russia meddled with the 2016 election. He supported Trump's  (who was leading the investigation into the meddling) and that said the U.S. should focus on other issues. As of May 2017, Issa had voted in line with Trump's positions 100% of the time; by October 2018, that number had fallen to 93.3%.\n\nOn January 7, 2021, after Trump supporters  building, Issa  the certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the .

He voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act in 2005 after successfully amending it to require judicial notification, reporting requirements and facts justifying the use of roving surveillance at new facilities or places.\n\nIssa is one of several s in Congress. He had a significant role in U.S. peace initiatives in the Middle East. He traveled to Lebanon and Syria in an effort to negotiate the end of the .

After Issa voted for the AHCA, about 800 people from the organization protested, on the grounds that a significant portion of his voters rely on the ACA. The group was also unhappy about a photo in which Issa stood \"front and center\" in tribute to Republicans' success in passing the AHCA.\n\nInstead of coming back to California to meet the protesters, Issa flew to an event in Florida to raise money, though he said he would meet with them later.\n\nThe next Friday, over 100 people protested his desire to defund .\n\nAn organization called Save My Care spent $500,000 to release a series of attack ads against 24 House members who voted for the AHCA, including one about Issa.\n\n\nIn 2023, he voted for a resolution stating support for Israel against  launched by Hamas.\n\n\nOn July 19, 2022, Issa and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the , which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.\n\n\nIssa supports embryonic  research and has voted to allow it.\n\nHe co-sponsored both the 2008 and 2009 versions of the  and sponsored the  () introduced in 2011, all of which aim at a reversal of the 's Public Access Policy, which   to NIH-funded research.\n\n\n\nIssa voted against the .

They were no match for Galanter's army of neighborhood activists, made up of Democrats, Republicans, suburban homeowners and  renters. . . . The election was also widely regarded as a  of a new brand of politics in the city, with Galanter leading a protest against the effect of development on traffic, air and water pollution and neighborhood tranquility. . . .

She opposed expansion plans at  but favored them at . Both sites are under the ownership of the city of Los Angeles.\n\n''', 1991.''' \nRuth Galanter inherited a neighborhood sponsored assessment for improving the Venice Canals, but the final design selection and ultimate canal improvements in 1991 can be credited to Galanter's leadership as a Los Angeles City Councilwoman.\n\nThe original assessment project was sponsored by the Venice Canals Association (VCA) in 1976 during 's term as council member. Venice Canals Association board members Barbara Michalak, Les Otterstrom, Paula Tate, Marla Engel, Ruth Ann Steffens, Fred Hoffman, Anita Henkins, Joseph Smith, W. Reid Monroe, Bonnie Felix, and Murray Leral worked to establish the assessment district for the Venice Canal Improvement Project.  The first attempted design for the 1977 Venice Canals Assessment district was prepared by City of Los Angeles public works under the direction of City Engineer Luis Ganajas.   The design was known as the vertical wall plan, similar to the existing Marina Del Rey walls, and was vertical solid cement with a decorative end cap.  At the time there were at least three historic attempts to restore or rehabilitate the Venice Canals, all eventually leading to failure or opposition.  The last attempt was a deep water plan that was stopped in the 1960s. Mayor Tom Bradley publicly stated \"The Venice Canals will not be improved in my lifetime.\"\n\nAfter Ruth Galanter was elected, she stated that she was not happy with the environmental aspects, the costs, the historical design and the safety of the vertical wall plan, so one of her early actions was to stop the city engineers from pursuing the vertical wall plan.  Galanter asked the state agency California Coastal Conservancy to review the options for a canal improvement project.  The Coastal Conservancy made several plans suggestions, including one using Armorflex. Armorflex was a cement material connected by cables and had holes allowing for plant growth and a gentle slope. A test site was installed on Eastern bank of Sherman Canal near the Dell Ave. Bridge.  The Armorflex test site turned out to be a failure, with the plants not growing out of the block, and it looked awful aesthetically.  The majority of the neighbor who would be assessed by the new design were now opposed to the Armorflex plan, and in a poll stated that they would rather have no plan than one that included Armorflex.  A poll by the City of Los Angeles found that over 79 percent of the homeowners opposed the assessment project using the Armorflex material.\n\nAfter being elected, Ruth Galanter held several meetings with the Venice Canals Association under the leadership of Mark Galanty about the Canal improvement project.  Galanter had said she would be open to other plans, but for the time she would continue the Armorflex design.  Based on public meetings and city polling it was clear that the Armorflex plan would not be approved by the property owners and the project would fail again.\n\nMark Galanty assembled a committee of the VCA to locate a compromise design and material.  Loffelstein, or Loffel Block, was identified by a VCA committee member Andy Shores as possibly meeting those goals.  It allowed plants to grow inside the material, could be placed on a slope to allow birds and wildlife to climb out of the canals, was safe for small children as it allowed them to hold on to the sides, and or climb out of the Canals, was lower cost project over the Armorflex design, and was aesthetically pleasing to the property owners. Mark Galanty recruited canal resident architects to create a design board with the Loffel Block material, and Galanty publicly presented the Loffel design Plan at a public meeting with Councilwoman Galanter in attendance. Galanter stated she would be open to the Venice Canals Association design material. Mark Galanty got the Loffel Block distributor in Orange County to install a test site across from the Armorflex test site at the distributors cost.  The test was successful with plants growing in the blocks, wildlife and ducks able to climb up the material, and the majority of the property owners supporting this design.  Galanter agreed to have city engineers design an official city plan using the Loffel Block. Luis Ganajas revised the plans to include the material Loffel Block at 55 degree slope. VCA members Robert Trask and Mark Galanty took the city design, an actual Loffel Block, and the community support poll showing overwhelming support to different Venice groups, city government agencies, state agencies, environmental groups, historical groups, and each property owner on the canals getting support for what was termed \"The Compromise Plan\". Eventually, letters of support for the Loffel plan were presented to the city from the Sierra Club, Heal the Bay, the local state senator and state assemblyman, both U.S. senators, and the local county supervisor. Based on the support of the Loffel Block design over the Armorflex design, Councilwoman Galanter had Public Works drop the Armorflex plan and focused on the Loffel Block plan.\n\nCouncilwoman Galanter and staff member Jim Bichart, as well as city engineer Luis Ganajas and environmental engineer Russ Ruffing worked on the city, state and national approvals.  At the Coastal Commission hearing the Venice Canals Association supported the plan, and there was finally no opposition to the restoring of the Venice Canals.  The estimated costs for the improvements was 6.3 million dollars, and included dredging the canals and removing the soil to a class 1 toxic site, removing crumbling sidewalks, replacing with new sidewalks, 5 feet deep in center,  feet on the sides, Loffel black at 55 degrees through the canals.  Rebuilding the foot bridges that go over the canals.  The City Engineers designed Atriplex, aka Salt Bush, as a natural hedge along the canal banks as a safety barrier to the canals.   The property owners in the canals paid approximately $6,600 over a 10-year period for a 30- by 90-foot lot frontage, and $7,800 for a 40- by 90-foot lot frontage.  Work began in March 1992, and was completed in 1993.  The assessment could be paid in full, or paid over time with interest at approximately 5%.\n\n\n\nIn July 2002, the city council voted to move Galanter's entire  into the East , including ,  and parts of , ,  and , because of the increase of population in the Valley. At first opposed to the move, Galanter later embraced it and \"unveiled an ambitious plan to curb flooding in Sun Valley, remove hundreds of pieces of discarded furniture throughout the district, repair streets and energize the political culture of a district known for voter apathy.\"\n\nGalanter worked with the community to get a $50,000 sculpture installed at \"a piece of public art demanded by some people who were outraged over a series of bronze statues that they said were a poor fit for the airport.\" The ''Los Angeles Daily News'' reported that:\n\nGalanter said the project represents the first time a Los Angeles community was able to select the kind of art it wanted under the city's program that funnels 1 percent of developers' fees to public art. The winning design is a 15-foot-high concrete replica of an airplane wing, adorned with a bronze eagle. Its base is surrounded by figurines from aviation and Hollywood , , who helped shape the history of the 75-year-old facility where the final scene from the classic \"\" was filmed.\n\n\n\nIn 2005-06, Galanter occupied the Bellarmine College Visiting Chair in Los Angeles Urban Research at . At that time she was the principal of Galanter and Company, a consulting firm specializing in \"land use, urban infrastructure, environmental policy and political strategy.\"\n\n\n\nGalanter said when she left office she believed her \"most lasting legacy\" would be a law requiring s in homes.\n\n\n\nAccess to some of the ''Los Angeles Times'' links may require the use of a library card.\n\n\n\n*  \"Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Healthy,\" an essay  in the ''Los Angeles Times'' by Ruth Galanter and Geraldine Dallek, about health care for immigrants, January 7, 1979, page E-1\n*  Galanter's LinkedIn page\n* Interviews\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were , but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, 'I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that's something you like'. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way.\" He has also said: \"It would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you're supposed to do the best you can by the gift you're given of life and that alone.\"\n\nIn 1975, Eastwood publicly proclaimed his participation in  when he appeared on '''' with , the founder of Transcendental Meditation.

Raman, a member of the  and the , defeated incumbent Councilmember  in 2020.\n\n\nNithya Raman was born in , , and moved to  at 6 years old. She earned a bachelor's degree in political theory from  then a  in  urban planning from .\n\n\nAfter living in the United States for many years, Raman returned to her home country of India and founded the research firm Transparent Chennai. The firm's goal was to improve sanitation in the city of . Prior to entering politics, Raman founded and headed a homelessness nonprofit in Los Angeles and was the executive director of  Entertainment.\n\n\n\nRaman declared her candidacy for the Los Angeles City Council in 2019, citing the issue of homelessness as being central to her decision to run. Raman's candidacy was largely fueled by grassroots volunteers, whom she claims knocked on more than 70,000 doors before the March primary. Ground Game LA, which formed following former -endorsed candidate Jessica Salans' defeat by  in the  in 2017, was credited with helping her campaign win.\n\nRaman's platform included proposed reforms to Los Angeles' housing and homelessness policy, \"a new approach to public safety,\" and a climate change plan that she claims will get Los Angeles to  by 2030. She has signed the Participatory Budget Pledge, an initiative put forward by  LA which expresses a commitment to \"holding a participatory budgeting process each budget cycle I hold elected office.\"\n\nIn the March 3, 2020 primary, Raman faced incumbent  and screenwriter Sarah Kate Levy. Ryu received 32,298 votes (44.4%), Raman received 31,502 votes (40.8%), and Sarah Kate Levy received 10,860 votes (14.1%). Because no candidate received over fifty percent of the vote, Raman and Ryu advanced to the runoff election, scheduled for November 3, 2020.\n\nIn the November 2020 runoff election, Raman defeated Ryu by a 52.87% to 47.13% margin. She will serve a four-year term as member of the City Council. Raman's victory was described as a \"political earthquake\" by the ''''.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Raman was challenged by Ethan Weaver, a Deputy City Attorney who received support from local landlords, business groups, and police and firefighter unions, and Levon Baronian. She won the election in the primary in March 2024, skipping a November runoff by winning 50.6% of the vote outright, versus 38.6% for Weaver, her nearest opponent.\n\n\n\nIn April 2021, Raman proposed amendments to a draft ordinance on tenant harassment. The amendments classified cash buyout offers and threats to report false information to law enforcement as forms of harassment, and included a rent adjustment penalty, which would prevent landlords who violate the ordinance from raising a unit's rent. The ordinance was passed in June 2021.\n\nIn June 2021, Raman was served with a recall notice after only six months in office. The '''' referred to the notice as part of a \"recall fever\" striking California, as at least 68 other active recalls were then ongoing in the state, including the recall of Governor . In September 2021 the recall campaign collapsed when proponents announced that they were unable to collect the required number of signatures within the allotted time.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, Raman was appointed to the board of the  by  . She replaced councilmember . She pledged to prioritize public health and environmental justice from that position.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Raman was one of three councilmembers to vote against L.A.M.C. Section , a city ordinance that banned homeless encampments within 500 feet of schools and daycare centers. 41.18 was adopted by the City Council by a vote of 11-3, over the objections of activists who protested the measure in the Council chamber. In remarks in a City Council meeting, Raman argued that the measure \"creates a district by district arms-race, where people will get pushed around from district to district instead of having a citywide strategy that prioritizes intervention in encampments by need, by safety, by fire risk, by all of the things that we are claiming to be so concerned about. In the end, this will just push people around again. It's not going to solve homelessness or get anybody into housing.\"\n\nA  between Council President , Councilmembers  and , as well as  President  revealed the group's plan to use redistricting to oust Raman. Speaking of Raman, Cedillo stated that \"There's certain people who don't merit us rescuing them...She's not our ally, she's not going to help us\" and de León proposed to put her district \"in a blender, chop it up left or right.\" The group planned to split the  neighborhood, a voting block for Raman, so that minority voters in her renters' district would be divided and she would face a tougher reelection. After the conversation was leaked, Raman introduced a measure to ask voters to change the city charter so that redistricting would be handled by an independent commission.\n\nIn June 2023, during a protest led by  Local 11, the  arrested Raman after she refused to disperse.\n\nOn February 3, 2024, Raman was censured by the Los Angeles chapter of the  for seeking and accepting an endorsement by the Los Angeles chapter of the Zionist lobby group Democrats for Israel. However, she maintained her endorsement by the DSA Los Angeles chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaman identified herself as a \"homelessness nonprofit leader\" when she first ran for office in 2020. In 2024 , the Mayor of Los Angeles, endorsed Nithya Raman's campaign for reelection, and her work on . \n\nRaman has made her work on homelessness a cornerstone of her reelection campaign, drawing praise from advocates, nonprofit groups and many of her colleagues.\n\nIn Raman's view the situation of the homeless is directly linked to the housing shortage. Specifically responding to citizen complaints about the homeless encampments in the  area of Hollywood, she acknowledged the difficulty of finding a room indoors acceptable to the homeless, later stating, \"We do not have the shelter resources we need for our homeless population.\"\n\nCity officials here have limited discretion. Since the '''' (2018) decision by the , the involuntary clearing homeless encampments by municipalities in its jurisdiction may be considered \"\" and thus unconstitutional.\n\n\"Bass and Raman have embraced a similar strategy: Send outreach workers and other specialists... to make offers of motel rooms, hotel rooms and other types of temporary housing... .\" The homeless may then either voluntarily accept or reject such offers. Raman claims success in clearing encampments in Los Feliz, Studio City, Sherman Oaks, among a dozen other spots in her district.\n\n\n\nIn response to the , Raman stated \"I stand with the , and with Armenians worldwide, in strongly condemning 's unprovoked military attacks against civilians. I have the privilege to represent a vast, vibrant Armenian community in the Fourth District, so many of whom have welcomed me as their representative with open arms  and I deeply share in their sadness and anger.

She was the first woman and the first lesbian to chair that committee. She also served for four years as a conferee on the state's Joint Budget Conference Committee, which writes the final version of California's state budget. As a member of the State Assembly, Migden authored legislation to create California's domestic partner registry, promote children's health, preserve the  , increase accountability in K–12 schools, protect borrowers from predatory and , protect consumers from manipulation by energy generators, and promote the use of .\n\nIn 1998, Migden authored the '‘Safe Needles Act'’ (AB1208 - 1998) that became a national model for legislation that President Clinton signed into law in 2000.

Assembly Bill 26 in 1999 marked the first time in the nation a state legislature passed a domestic partnership statute without forcible intervention of the courts. (Assembly Bill 26).\n\nMigden's SB 565 provided for the legalization of the transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes (Senate Bill 565) and provided for the filing of domestic partner income-tax returns under the same status as married couples.

With rising property tax values, the state decided to withhold an additional $4 million of county generated tax revenues to pay for programs for troubled children throughout California. Marin officials claimed the state was forcing the county to shoulder an unfair degree of state oriented funding. Governor  vetoed two bills pushed forward by Migden to resolve the issue. Migden's third bill passed and resulted in cutting the amount of surplus funds the county will annually pay to the state by half. The bill resulted in an extra $1.9&nbsp;million a year for Marin County and a total return of $24.7&nbsp;million to the area.\n\n\n\nMigden was born August 14, 1948, in New York City. Migden is .

She has been in complete remission for many years.\n\nMigden's legislative activity persisted, uninterrupted, during the time she was undergoing treatment, continuing to enact legislation including the Clean Water Act, the first Domestic Partnership bill, HMO Health Care Reform, and many others.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, Migden ran a stop sign by the  and crashed into a 1990  sedan owned by Teresa Latham. The crash injured Latham and destroyed Latham's car. Latham claimed that Migden did not \"seem concerned at all about the situation.\" Migden accepted full responsibility for the accident and refutes the claim that she was not concerned about Latham or her car.\n\nOn May 18, 2007, Migden crashed her SUV into a sedan which was stopped at a red light, injuring Ellen Butawan and her 3-year-old daughter, who were sent to the emergency room.

In 1999, Migden received \"Legislator of the Year\" honors from the . and the ' \"Lesbian Leadership Award\". In 2000, she was recognized with the \"Affordable Housing Leadership Award\". In 2001, Migden was named \"Legislator of the Year\" by the California .\n\n\nSeeking a second term in the state senate, Migden failed to win renomination in the 2008 primary election held on 2008-06-03. She finished second in a three-way race. Assemblyman  won the nomination, while Migden finished slightly ahead of former Assemblyman  from . She was the first legislator to lose a renomination since Assemblyman  lost his primary race in 1996. The election was won by Democrat Mark Leno.\n\nThe race was one of the costliest legislative races in the state. Migden came into the race with $647,000 in the bank from past races, but according to the  (FPPC), she did not properly transfer campaign funds. The FPPC investigators found 89 violations in campaign finance reporting. The FPPC originally prevented her from using the $647,000 from previous races.

Cedillo attempted to have driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants reinstated, and was the author of the . He also worked on increasing and expanding access to health care, developing regional solutions to combat homelessness, and encouraging economic development in his Downtown Los Angeles district.  Gil Cedillo is a member of the Council of La Raza.\n\nCedillo was re-elected in 2006, defeating South Pasadena City Councilman Mike Ten, a Republican. Cedillo received 71,199 votes, Ten received 18,581 votes, and Murray Levy, a  candidate, received 3,469 votes. He was Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Immigration and the Economy and was a member of the Senate standing committees on Appropriations, Health, Public Safety, Rules, and Transportation and Housing.\n\nOn September 28, 2006, Cedillo was arrested along with approximately 200 others for blocking Century Blvd. in front of , during a protest supporting the right for employees to unionize at the LAX hotels.\n\n\nOn January 8, 2009, Cedillo announced his candidacy for the 32nd Congressional District seat, which was vacated by Congresswoman . Congresswoman Solis accepted an appointment from President-elect  as United States Labor Secretary.  In the  (now superseded by  ), Cedillo competed against , a former Monterey Park assemblywoman and vice-chairman of the State Board of Equalization; the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, voted to endorse Chu.  Cedillo received a majority of other major endorsements, including eight members of California's Congressional Delegation, LA Sheriff Lee Baca, Los Angeles Police Chief Bill Bratton, and more than 100 current and former public officials, including Senator Gloria Romero, Senator Ron Calderon, and Assemblymember Ed Chavez, who all dropped out of the race and endorsed Cedillo. Chu defeated Cedillo with 15,338 votes (31.9%) to Cedillo's 11,244 votes (23.4%).\n\nFollowing his failed bid for U.S. Congress, Cedillo was elected to the California State Assembly's 45th District seat in 2010. The seat had been vacated by Kevin de León, who won the 22nd State Senate seat. Cedillo served as chairman of California's Latino Congressional Caucus. In 2010, Cedillo authored California's SRC 113, a resolution for a statewide boycott of the State of Arizona, following Arizona's passage of SB 1070, an undocumented immigration enforcement bill. \n\n\n\n\nCedillo tried nine times, since 1998, to get bills passed in the  that would allow  in California to obtain s. In 2001 and 2002   vetoed two of Cedillo's bills that would have permitted this. In the midst of the , Davis backed and signed SB&nbsp;60 (2003), Cedillo's driver's license bill.  After Davis was recalled and  became governor, the state legislature, with Schwarzenegger's support, repealed the new law before it went into effect. Senator Cedillo agreed to repeal the law he wrote under the agreement with the Governor to work on a bipartisan bill. In 2004, Schwarzenegger vetoed AB&nbsp;2895, an identical bill to Senator Cedillo's SB&nbsp;1160 that stalled in the legislature, saying that it did not meet his security concerns. The governor wanted a \"marked license\" that was identifiable. AB&nbsp;2895 was introduced to the legislature by one of Cedillo's closest allies, Speaker of the Assembly .\n\nIn 2005, Cedillo authored SB&nbsp;60, another driver's license bill. He made new modifications to the proposal, specifying that undocumented immigrants would not be able to use the driver's license for purposes of identification for boarding airplanes, opening bank accounts, registering to vote, or other rights of U.S. citizens. Again, Schwarzenegger refused to sign the bill, on the grounds that it did not satisfy his security concerns. After Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill, Cedillo threatened to file a lawsuit against the Governor because of his belief that the  misinterpreted SB&nbsp;976 (1993), which first prohibited the issuance of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants in the process of becoming legal residents, and citizens considered to have authorized presence but not legal permanent residency status, are known as people residing under the color of the law.\n\nIn 2006 and 2009 Cedillo again brought the proposal before the California legislature, failing both times. On October 3, 2013, California Governor Brown signed AB&nbsp;60, allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. Cedillo remarked, ″It took a long time, but now it’s here. Today signifies much more than just another bill being signed by our governor. Today is history in the making because it is the day we return justice back to the people.″\n\n\nIn 2011, Cedillo authored a pair of assembly bills to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain financial aid for universities through both private and public sources. The assembly bills, known as AB&nbsp;130 and AB&nbsp;131 for private and public financial aid respectively, became law.  The measures have drawn both praise and criticism from various organizations.  Proponents state that the bill would finally narrow the large gap in education for a US citizen and an undocumented immigrant, thus providing equality and greater opportunity. Critics claim that the measure is a waste of taxpayer money for an already cash-strapped California with tuition costs increasing and many students unable to continue their education.\n\n\nIn August 2011, at nearly the same time AB&nbsp;131 was passed by the Senate, AB&nbsp;353 also passed.  The bill allows drivers without a license who are stopped at checkpoints to have a licensed driver retrieve the vehicle and thereby avoid having the vehicle impounded for 30 days.\n\n\nIn 2010, Cedillo attempted to reverse a pay cut approved by voters in 2009 for all 120 lawmakers (Prop. 25). Cedillo filed a claim in December 2010 with the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board seeking back pay for what he maintains were illegal pay and benefit cuts. His complaint stemmed from the 2009 decision by the California Citizens Compensation Commission to slash legislators' pay and benefits by 18 percent. The cut reduced their remuneration from 116,208 to $95,291.\n\n\n\n and actor  in 2020.]]\n\n\n\nBecause of s, Cedillo could not run for reelection to the  in 2012.

His opponents were Jesse Rosas, Giovany Hernandez, and Joe Bray-Ali. In the primary election Cedillo won 49.4 percent, missing the threshold to avoid a runoff election. Challenger Joe Bray-Ali drew 38 percent, more than any other challenger, and was able to face Cedillo in the runoff. Cedillo defeated Bray-Ali in the runoff with over 70% of the voters in Council District 1 on May 16, 2017.\n\n\nCedillo secured an endorsement from Bernie Sanders for his 2022 reelection race. However, he lost to political newcomer, .\n\n\nIn December 2013, Cedillo authored a Los Angeles City Council resolution urging President Obama to halt most deportations and to expand the  (DACA) program to \"all immigrant families who are not engaged in criminal activity.\"\n\nIn May 2017 Cedillo authored a motion requiring companies to disclose whether they were\ninvolved with the construction of the  promised by President  before being able to work with the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2022, Cedillo faced calls to resign after attending a secretly recorded meeting where fellow Council member , Council president , and  President  had made racist remarks was released anonymously on .\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He was elected to be mayor  (avoiding a runoff). Before that, he was  and the leader of the majority party in the  from 2008 to 2014.\n\nSteinberg was a  member of the  representing the  . He had also previously served as a member of the  (1998–2004) and as a member of the  (1992–1998).\n\n\n\nBorn in  to a  family, Steinberg graduated from  in Millbrae-San Bruno, California, and from  where he earned a  in economics. He then earned a  from the .\n\nHe served as an employee rights attorney for the  for 10&nbsp;years before his work as an  and mediator. He has continued to mediate disputes of public interest during his tenure as mayor. In 2022, he mediated a dispute between the  and , and was appointed to mediate between the  and the  during the . He also was once a UAW member.\n\n\nSteinberg was a member of the  from 1998 until he was termed out in 2004. During his time in the Assembly he served as chair of the Assembly Committees on Budget, Appropriations, Judiciary, Labor and Employment, and the Select Committee on High Priority Schools. He authored 80 bills that were signed into law in areas that included mental health, K-12 education, foster care, and workplace safety. Steinberg is considered a strong advocate for children and mental health issues. He opposed  clauses.\n\nSteinberg authored legislation to focus additional educational resources on high-poverty schools and make them more accountable for improvement. He authored several laws to improve the state's foster care system, including measures to improve system accountability and educational stability. His legislation in foster care included AB 408, which mandated steps to help older foster youth find permanent homes and families. He also passed AB 34, the first significant expansion of community mental health programs in more than a decade.\n\nSteinberg also authored AB 1127, a landmark bill to give stronger prosecutorial power to district attorneys to address serious and willful violations of  regulations that result in worker injuries and deaths. Some supporters called this legislation \"the Tosco bill\" because of an accident that occurred at the Tosco Refinery near Martinez, California in 1999. The accident, which resulted in four deaths, was held up as an example of insufficient penalties for dangerous workplace-safety violations.\n\n\n\nSteinberg was the President pro Tempore of the California State Senate from 2008 to 2014. In February 2008, he was selected by Senate Democrats to become Pro Tem in the next legislative session, when the incumbent would be termed-out. He took office in November 2008 as the first Senate leader from Sacramento since 1883.\n\nBefore being elevated to Pro Tem, he was Chair of the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee.  He also chaired the Senate Select Committee on High School Graduation., the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, and the Legislative Blue Ribbon Commission on .\n\nAs a member of the State Senate, Steinberg continued many of the same causes he had undertaken as a member of the Assembly. He continued his work on improving test scores, aiding under performing schools, lowering dropout rates, and improving the state's mental health system.  In 2007, Steinberg introduced a bill to cap at 20 the number of hours high school students can work after school if their  is not 2.5 or higher.\n\nOn November 13, 2013, State Sen.  lashed out at Federal authorities claiming that they wanted him to record conversations between Sen. Steinberg and fellow Sen.  in a sting operation targeting Steinberg and De Leon.\n\n\nThroughout his legislative career, Steinberg has been a strong advocate for mental health care. He has called it \"the under-attended issue in our time and in our society\". He is known within the mental health community as a long time champion.\n\nSteinberg became passionate about mental health during his time on the . In 1997, the City of Sacramento engaged in a lawsuit against Loaves and Fishes, a private charity providing food to the homeless. The free lunches began to draw thousands of homeless people which had become a nuisance to local business near the shelter in North Sacramento. Former Mayor  and then Councilmember Steinberg were the only two members to vote against the lawsuit. Upon further investigation into the rapidly increasing homeless population, Steinberg discovered that an overwhelming portion of homeless suffered from mental illness and did not have access to proper mental health care. He took up working on ways to help solve this issue.\n\n\nDuring his first year in the State Assembly, Steinberg authored AB 34, which began three pilot projects that provided integrated services to the homeless in Stanislaus, Los Angeles and Sacramento counties. The pilot was so successful in lowering hospitalization, incarceration and homeless episodes the program was expanded to more than 30 counties in late 2000 as AB 2034. Data collection by the pilot programs demonstrated the success of the services being provided.\n\n\nSteinberg authored Proposition 63, the , approved by California voters on the November 2004 statewide ballot. The act imposes a 1% tax on incomes of $1,000,000 or more for mental health funding. He co-authored \"Prop 63\" with advocate Sherman Russell Selix Jr. In the first five years, the program has provided mental health care to 400,000 Californians.\n\nThe Mental Health Services Act includes a \"whatever-it-takes\" approach to support services for people with severe mental illness and is the first of its kind in the United States. Services can include providing a safe place to live, a job, help in school, physical health care, clothing, food, or treatment when a mental illness and a substances abuse disorder are combined. These are examples of full service partnerships which have been proven to be effective in helping people with severe mental illness transition successfully to independent living situations.\n\nThe Act also provides Prevention and Early Intervention services (PEI). PEI improves mental health care treatment by creating programs in places where mental health services are not traditionally given, such as schools, community centers and faith-based organizations. The intent of PEI programs is to engage individuals before the development of serious mental illness or serious emotional disturbance or to alleviate the need for additional or extended mental health treatment.\n\nThe Mental Health Services Act has proven to be a cost-effective way to address mental health care. A 2012 report found that every dollar spent of mental health services in California saved roughly $0.88 in costs to criminal justice and health, and housing services by reducing the number of arrests, incarcerations, ER visits, and hospitalizations.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Steinberg backed a legislative proposal that would make Sacramento the first city in California to end zoning that permits only the construction of one single-family home on a property. The proposal was intended to deal with the housing shortage and skyrocketing rents in California.\n\nIn June 2021, Steinberg was one of 11 U.S. mayors to form  (MORE), a coalition of municipal leaders dedicated to starting pilot  programs in their cities.

Herrera was previously , known for his longtime legal advocacy for same-sex marriage in , including the '''', 43 Cal.4th 757 (2008), and '''', 570. U.S. (2013), as well as the legal fight against . He was first elected as City Attorney in 2001, and re-elected without opposition in 2005, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2019. He ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of San Francisco in the , finishing third in the City's ranked-choice voting system. After his long-standing position as City Attorney, he was unanimously approved in 2021 to become the general manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.\n\n\n\nBorn November 6, 1962 in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, Herrera grew up in the nearby middle class community of Glen Cove. His father was a psychiatrist who immigrated from Colombia after serving as part of a UN Peacekeeping force during the Suez War of 1956. His mother is the child of Italian immigrants and worked as a nurse in Glen Cove.\n\nHerrera earned his bachelor's degree from  in , and his Juris Doctor from the  in Washington, D.C. Herrera worked various jobs to support himself during his education, from his newspaper route as a young boy, to restocking shelves at the local grocery store, to serving as a short order cook in a local diner. Upon graduating from law school in 1987, Herrera was offered an associate position at a maritime law firm in San Francisco and moved to the city.\n\n\nAfter his move to San Francisco, Herrera joined his local Democratic club and helped to get Democratic candidates elected in the city. In 1990, he was appointed to the Waterfront Plan Advisory Board, and later served on the Finance Committee for the California Democratic Party.\n\nIn 1993 Herrera was appointed to the U.S. Maritime Administration in Washington, D.C. during President Clinton's Administration. He returned to private practice in San Francisco as a partner in the maritime law firm of Kelly, Gill, Sherburne & Herrera.\n\nThen-Mayor Willie Brown appointed Herrera to the SF Transportation Commission, and later to the . Herrera was voted the President of the Police Commission after just one year of service.\n\n\nIn December 2001, Herrera was elected San Francisco City Attorney, becoming the first Latino to hold the office. He was re-elected in 2005, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2019.\n\n\n\nOn January 31, 2017 Herrera brought the first lawsuit in the nation against President Donald Trump over his executive order threatening to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from sanctuary cities and other local and state governments.\n\nHerrera's federal lawsuit alleges that the executive order is unconstitutional and exceeds the president's power. The trial court ruled in San Francisco's favor, finding Trump's executive order unconstitutional and ordering a nationwide halt to enforcement of it. The federal government appealed that ruling. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 1, 2018 upheld the district court's ruling on the merits in favor of San Francisco, finding that the executive order violates the Constitution's separation-of-powers guarantee, which reserves legislative and spending authority to Congress, not the president.\n\nHerrera on August 11, 2017 filed a second lawsuit against the Trump administration, this one seeking to invalidate new grant conditions that U.S. Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III sought to place on a group of U.S. Department of Justice grants for local law enforcement. Those grant conditions were issued after the district court had issued a preliminary injunction in April 2017 that halted enforcement of the sanctuary executive order as the case proceeded.\n\n\nHerrera on September 19, 2017 sued the top five investor-owned fossil fuel companies seeking billions of dollars for infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco against sea-level rise caused by global warming from their products. At a March 2018 climate change tutorial requested by the judge, the fossil fuel companies were compelled to acknowledge that the science of global warming is no longer in dispute.\n\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, Herrera launched investigations into Uber and Lyft over driver pay and benefits, accessibility, discrimination, public safety issues and potential violations of other state and local laws.\n\n\nOn September 26, 2017, San Francisco became the first city in the country to sue Equifax for failing to protect the personal data of more than 15 million Californians, part of a data breach that compromised the personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers.\n\n\nHerrera sued the rental car company and its affiliate on March 2, 2017 for charging drivers hidden fees when they cross the .\n\n\nHerrera successfully defended San Francisco's short-term rental regulations from legal challenge by  and  and secured a settlement in May 2017 that requires the companies to ensure that listings on their site comply with San Francisco law, protecting rent-controlled apartments from being used as de facto hotels.\n\nIn May 2017, Herrera secured a court victory that got tenant evictions voided and $5.4 million in court awards against abusive landlord Anne Kihagi, had worked to force tenants from their rent-controlled homes so she could charge more money.\n\nOn August 16, 2006, Herrera sued CitiApartments for unlawful business and tenant harassment practices, which forced out rent-controlled tenants to allow higher rents to be charged for the same units. The subsequent settlement, with penalties up to $10 million, put the company out of business.\n\nIn 2021, Herrera sued a developer who had built 29 apartments in a lot that San Francisco's zoning regulations specified could only have 10 apartments. Herrera's lawsuit happened amid a severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis in San Francisco.\n\n\nHerrera declared in November 2016 that the state's current cash bail system is unconstitutional and refused to defend it in a federal class-action lawsuit brought by a national civil rights group against San Francisco's sheriff. This led to a legislative drive to reform the state's system where the only factor in deciding whether an inmate is freed prior to appearing before a judge is if they can pay the amount on the bail schedule.\n\n\nIn December 2016, Herrera reached a settlement with  valued at more than $60 million in cash and property to house low-income seniors. The for-profit academy for years had violated state and local laws in its aggressive acquisition and use of vast real estate holdings in San Francisco.\n\n\nHerrera has been involved in a number of high-profile cases against the National Rifle Association and other gun rights advocates, both to defend San Francisco's gun control measures and to challenge gun industry practices. He also filed lawsuits in 2013 and 2017 against several companies for flouting state and local law by selling complete but disassembled large-capacity gun magazines as \"repair kits.\" He secured settlements ending sales to customers in California of these devices.\n\n\nHerrera sued the accrediting agency that was trying to close City College of San Francisco on August 22, 2013. He won preliminary injunction motion that halted the termination action and secured injunctions to protect City College's rights in the evaluation process.\n\n\nHerrera investigated the Art Institute of California's marketing practices that underestimated student costs and inflated job placement figures, resulting in a settlement in 2014 that included a $1.95 million payment to San Francisco, endowing a $1.6 million scholarship fund for students who wished to return to finish their studies and offering $850,000 in general scholarships to new students.\n\n\nHerrera sued Blue Cross and Health Net in 2011, alleging that these insurance companies systematically underpaid San Francisco General Hospital and other public hospitals for emergency services provided to their policy-holders. He reached a $6.25 million settlement for past claims and an agreement to reimburse at a higher rate for at least three years going forward.\n\nWhen the Healthy San Francisco Initiative became law in 2006, establishing universal health care in the City, Herrera successfully defended the law's constitutionality against legal challenge. When some of the fees earmarked for the initiative were misappropriated by San Francisco restaurants, he convinced some of the restaurants to participate in a voluntary settlement program that recovered $844,000 for their employees.\n\n\nAfter  discovered that mental patients in Nevada were being bused to various California cities without any supervision or plan for what they would do upon arrival, Herrera opened an investigation that found that dozens of these patients had been shipped to San Francisco. Herrera brought a class-action lawsuit against Nevada in 2013 that was settled in 2015 with Nevada agreeing to provide travel assistance to California only for patients who meet appropriate criteria, ensuring that the patients are returning to a home address or to a medical facility or program, and that they will be received or accompanied by a responsible individual. Nevada also agreed to provide San Francisco with semi-annual reports about these patients with information that includes the date of discharge, destination city, and name of individuals at any medical facility that has agreed to receive the patient. Nevada also agreed to pay San Francisco $400,000.\n\n\nHerrera has been involved in every phase of the legal fight for marriage equality for same-sex couples in California.\n\nIn 2009, he joined the City of San Francisco as a plaintiff in the case of ''Perry v. Schwarzenegger'', seeking to overturn the state's ban on same-sex marriage, the first time any government entity had sued to challenge marriage laws discriminating against gay and lesbian couples. Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo and Santa Clara County Counsel Ann M. Ravel would also join their jurisdictions as plaintiffs in the suit.\n\nIn San Francisco's petition to the California Supreme Court, Herrera said: \"The issue before the court today is of far greater consequence than marriage equality alone ... Equal protection of the laws is not merely the cornerstone of the California Constitution, it is what separates constitutional democracy from mob rule tyranny. If allowed to stand, Prop 8 so devastates the principle of equal protection that it endangers the fundamental rights of any potential electoral minorityeven for protected classes based on race, religion, national origin and gender. The proponents of Prop 8 waged a ruthless campaign of falsehood and fear, funded by millions of dollars from out-of-state interest groups. Make no mistake that their success in California has dramatically raised the stakes. What began as a struggle for marriage equality is today a fight for equality itself. I am confident that our high court will again demonstrate its principled independence in recognizing this danger, and in reasserting our constitution's promise of equality under the law.\"\n\nProposition 8 was eventually held to violate the United States Constitution by federal district court judge Vaughn R. Walker on August 4, 2010, a decision that was left intact by the United States Supreme Court on June 26, 2013. Same-sex marriages began again in California two days later.\n\n\nAfter filing litigation against predatory payday lenders Money Mart and Check 'n Go on April 26, 2007, Herrera forced them to repay 10,000 California consumers $7.7 million and forgive another $8 million in debt.\n\n\nOn March 24, 2008, Herrera filed a lawsuit against the National Arbitration Forum and two other arbitration providers, alleging that the defendants were not neutral as they claimed in arbitration disputes between credit card companies and their customers, but were instead heavily biased in favor of lenders, calling NAF \"little more than a collection agent masquerading as a neutral party.\" He alleged that NAF's records showed that consumers prevailed in just 0.2% of arbitration cases that went to a hearing.\n\n\nWhile City Attorney, he lost the wrongful termination lawsuit brought by Joanne Hoeper, costing the taxpayers of the City and County of San Francisco millions of dollars. Hoeper, a 20-year veteran in the SF City Attorney's Office, claimed that her termination was retaliation for identifying improper approval of payments to plumbing contractors for unnecessary sewer repair work. \n\n\n\nOn February 3, 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Herrera sued the  and Superintendent Vincent Matthews for violating state law by not having a plan to \"offer classroom-based instruction whenever possible.\" At the time, public health rules had allowed schools to be open for months, and private schools in San Francisco had safely returned students to the classroom months earlier with no major outbreaks. Public schools, however, had remained closed, with no clear timeline to re-open. The school district is independent from the jurisdiction of the city. The lawsuit was the first of its kind, wherein a civil action is filed by a city against its school district over  within the state of California. The suit was supported by Mayor , who has criticized the Board for focusing on renaming 44 empty SFUSD schools during the pandemic rather than focusing on reopening. Both the Board and Matthews criticized the suit, calling it wasteful and inaccurate.\n\n\nIn late 2020, Harlan Kelly, General Manager of the  (SFPUC), was charged with wire fraud, forced to surrender his passport and undergo drug testing. In April 2021, Breed nominated Herrera to be the next General Manager. At the time of the nomination, Herrera stated that this move was \"putting the city's top watchdog at the head of the PUC.\" His appointment to the PUC was opposed by some environmental groups.  \n\nIn September 2021, Herrera, in a unanimous vote, was appointed general manager of the SFPUC. State Assemblyman  was subsequently appointed as City Attorney by Mayor London Breed to replace Herrera.  \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Over time, she moved leftward as California became one of the most Democratic states in the nation. In 2013, ''The New York Times'' called her a \"liberal lioness\". Feinstein was known for her advocacy of gun control, abortion access, environmental protection, and a strong national defense.\n\n\nFeinstein supported  during her Senate career. In 2003, she voted against the , a proposal to ban , although the proposal eventually became law. After the Supreme Court overturned '''' in 2022, Feinstein called for congressional action to protect abortion rights and stated her support for lifting the Senate filibuster rule to allow such legislation to pass with a simple majority.\n\n\n]]When Feinstein first ran for statewide office in 1990, she supported . In 2004, she called for the death penalty in the case of San Francisco police officer Isaac Espinoza, who was killed while on duty. By 2018, she opposed capital punishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Feinstein led a bipartisan effort as part of the wider  to significantly reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions, which accounted for 26 percent of total U.S. emissions at the time. Her legislation, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, raised  standards for America's fleet of vehicles by at least 10 miles per gallon between 2010 and 2020 - the largest increase in fuel efficiency in almost three decades. Thereafter, said CAFE standards became subject to periodic adjustments by the  under the . As a result of Feinstein's legislation, average fleet fuel economy for new automobiles will climb to approximately 60 miles per gallon by 2032, cutting greenhouse gas emissions from passenger and commercial vehicles in half without impeding automotive performance or degrading traffic safety.\n\nDuring the , Feinstein authored an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, mandating all major sources of greenhouse gasses to annually report their emissions to the .}} These emissions disclosures in turn inform EPA's nationwide, multi-sector inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, which is submitted to the United Nations in accordance with the .\n\nFeinstein co-sponsored (with  Republican ) an amendment through the Senate to the Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011 that eliminated the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit. The Senate passed the amendment on June 16, 2011. Introduced in 2004, the subsidy provided a 45-cent-per-gallon credit on pure ethanol, and a 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on imported ethanol. These subsidies had resulted in an annual expenditure of $6&nbsp;billion.\n\nIn February 2019, when youth associated with the  confronted Feinstein about why she did not support the , she told them, \"there's no way to pay for it\", and that it could not pass a Republican-controlled Senate. In a tweet after the confrontation, she said that she remained committed \"to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation\". Conversely, the Sunrise Movement tweeted that Feinstein had reacted with \"smugness and disrespect\", and that \"her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress.\"\n\nLater in the  and es, Feinstein authored the Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act, to prepare U.S.  for risks posed by climate change. While Feinstein's bill ultimately died in the Senate,  issued an executive order containing several of its provisions, including directing the  to study climate-related financial risks. In addition, Feinstein co-sponsored with  the Climate Action Rebate Act of 2019 - legislation that would create a nationwide  program to decarbonize the American economy and transition it to . As with the Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act, the Climate Action Rebate Act also failed to make it out of committee. However, a separate battery storage tax credit bill co-sponsored by Feinstein was ultimately incorporated into the , legislation she also supported.\n\n\nFeinstein, who spent her childhood visiting the lake, regarded  as \"a national treasure\" and \"the Jewel of the High Sierra\". She founded the Lake Tahoe Summit in 1997 and successfully authored the landmark Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000. This act of Congress formally created the  within the  and authorized $900&nbsp;million in federal spending over ten years for invasive species control, stormwater management, environmental protection, and fire risk mitigation projects throughout the Lake Tahoe watershed. Later in 2016, Feinstein co-sponsored with senators , , and  a bipartisan seven-year extension of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, authorizing another $415&nbsp;million to combat invasive species, improve water quality and forest health, restore habitat for fish and wildlife, and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires. She co-sponsored a second bipartisan, bicameral reauthorization of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act's activities with senators , , and  on March 1, 2023 – six months before her death.\n\n\nFeinstein co-sponsored legislation in 2006 with  that permanently protected approximately 300,000 acres of wilderness in Northern California, namely the King Range, Yolla-Bolly Middle Eel, and Trinity Alps wilderness areas, along with 21 miles of the  in Mendocino County. The , part of the , has the longest stretch of undeveloped coastline anywhere in the lower 48 states; its  is often considered the \"crown jewel\" in the . The Yolla-Bolly Middle Eel Wilderness, which surrounds the , hosts roughly half of California's summer-run  population. The river is the largest remaining wild run of these fish in the lower 48 states. The  encompasses rugged mountains, alpine meadows, myriad pristine lakes and streams, 550 miles of maintained hiking trails, and California's third-largest swath of previously unprotected old-growth, predominantly  forest.\n\nFeinstein also helped secure $250&nbsp;million in federal matching grants to purchase the 7,500-acre Headwaters Forest, the world's last unprotected, intact, old-growth  forest. Her 1999 legislation also guaranteed the continued conservation of 12 ancient redwood groves by bringing them under federal management. Several  call the Headwaters Forest home, including , the , and the . The resulting  is managed by the  in partnership with the  as part of the National Landscape Conservation System.\n\nPerhaps Feinstein's greatest contribution to public lands conservation came through her advocacy for California's  and s. She authored landmark legislation in 1994 that established , , and , and designated another 7.6&nbsp;million acres of California desert as federal wilderness. This  was followed in 2000 by Feinstein's Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument Act, designating 272,000 acres in the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto mountain ranges as a . Later in 2016, Feinstein requested  create , , and  national monuments under the . She also authored the California Desert Protection and Recreation Act as part of the  passed in 2019, furthering landscape conservation and outdoor recreation opportunities in the California desert. The combined acreage of the 1994, 2000, and 2019 acts of Congress, in concert with the presidentially authorized national monument designations, protect the largest tract of public lands anywhere in the lower 48 states and the second-largest desert preserve on the planet.\n\n\n\nFeinstein supported a conciliatory approach between  and fostered increased dialogue between high-level Chinese representatives and U.S. senators during her first term as senator. When asked about her relation with Beijing, Feinstein said, \"I sometimes say that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.\"\n\nFeinstein criticized Beijing's missile tests near Taiwan and called for dismantlement of missiles pointed at the island. She promoted stronger business ties between China and Taiwan over confrontation, and suggested that the U.S. patiently \"use two-way trade across Taiwan Strait as a platform for more political dialogue and closer ties\".\n\nShe believed that deeper cross-strait economic integration \"will one day lead to political integration and will ultimately provide the solution\" to the .\n\nOn July 27, 2018, reports surfaced that a Chinese staff member who worked for 20 years as Feinstein's personal driver, gofer and liaison to the Asian-American community was caught reporting to China's . According to the reports, the  had contacted Feinstein five years earlier warning her about the employee. The employee was later interviewed by authorities and forced to retire by Feinstein. No criminal charges were filed against him.\n\n\nFeinstein supported the  in July 2015, saying that it would usher in \"unprecedented & intrusive inspections to verify cooperation\" by Iran.\n\nOn June 7, 2017, Feinstein and Senator  issued dual statements urging the Senate to forgo a vote for sanctions on Iran in response to the  that occurred earlier in the day.\n\n\n\nFeinstein voted for the  and later said she regretted it.\n\n\nIn September 2016in advance of  condemning s in the occupied Feinstein signed an -sponsored letter urging Obama to veto \"one-sided\" resolutions against Israel.\n\nFeinstein opposed President 's decision to , saying, \"Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capitalor relocating our embassy to Jerusalemwill spark violence and embolden extremists on both sides of the debate.\"\n\n\nDuring a July 2017 appearance on '''' after  of an , Feinstein said the country had proven itself a danger to the U.S. She also expressed her disappointment with China's lack of response.\n\nResponding to reports that North Korea had achieved successful miniaturization of , Feinstein issued an August 8, 2017, statement insisting that isolation of North Korea had proven ineffective and that Trump's rhetoric was not helping resolve potential conflict. She also called for the U.S. to \"quickly engage North Korea in a high-level dialogue without any preconditions\".\n\nIn September 2017, after Trump's first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, in which he threatened North Korea, Feinstein released a statement disagreeing with his remarks: \"Trump's bombastic threat to destroy North Korea and his refusal to present any positive pathways forward on the many global challenges we face are severe disappointments.\"\n\n\n (left) with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (middle) and San Francisco Mayor  (right) in 2007]]\nFeinstein introduced the , which became law in 1994 and expired in 2004. In January 2013, about a month after the , she and Representative  proposed a bill that would \"ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing or importation of 150 specific firearms including semiautomatic rifles or pistols that can be used with a detachable or fixed ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and have specific military-style features, including pistol grips, grenade launchers or rocket launchers\". The bill would have exempted 900 models of guns used for sport and hunting. Feinstein said of the bill, \"The common thread in each of these shootings is the gunman used a semi-automatic assault weapon or large-capacity ammunition magazines. Military assault weapons only have one purpose, and in my opinion, it's for the military.\" The bill failed on a Senate vote of 60 to 40.\n\n\nFeinstein supported the , repeatedly voting to defeat initiatives aimed against it. She voted to regulate tobacco as a drug; expand the Children's Health Insurance Program; override the president's veto of adding 2 to 4 million children to  eligibility; increase Medicaid rebate for producing s; negotiate bulk purchases for Medicare prescription drugs; allow re-importation of prescription drugs from Canada; allow patients to sue s and collect s; cover prescription drugs under Medicare, and  Medicare. She voted against the  's Medicare choice, tax and spending cuts; and allowing tribal Indians to opt out of federal healthcare. Feinstein also favored the creation of a  to achieve , co-sponsoring a bill with that aim. Feinstein's congressional voting record was rated as 88% by the  (APHA), the figure ostensibly reflecting the percentage of time the representative voted the organization's preferred position.\n\nAt an April 2017 town hall meeting in San Francisco, Feinstein was booed when she stated that she did not support a proposal for single-payer health insurance. Feinstein said, \"[i]f  health care is going to mean the complete takeover by the government of all health care, I am not there.\" During a news conference at the  in July 2017, she estimated that Democratic opposition would prove sufficient to defeat Republican attempts to repeal the ACA. Feinstein wrote in an August 2017 op-ed that Trump could secure health-care reform if he compromised with Democrats: \"We now know that such a closed process on a major issue like health care doesn't work. The only path forward is a transparent process that allows every senator to bring their ideas to the table.\"\n\n\nIn September 2017, after Attorney General  rescinded the  program, Feinstein admitted the legality of the program was questionable while citing this as a reason for why a law should be passed. In her opening remarks at a January 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, she said she was concerned the Trump administration's decision to terminate  might be racially motivated, based on comments Trump made denigrating , , and .\n\n\nIn 1996, Feinstein was one of only 14 senators to vote against the  (DOMA), which defined marriage as an  union for purposes of federal law. In 2011, she introduced a bill to repeal DOMA. In 2022, she was the lead Senate sponsor of the , which repealed DOMA and required the federal government and all state governments to recognize  and s.\n\n\nFeinstein opposed a number of reforms to  at the state and federal level. In 2016 she opposed , the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, to  in California. In 1996 she opposed  to legalize the  in California. In 2015 she was the only Democrat at a Senate hearing to vote against the , legislation that limits the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized medical cannabis. Feinstein cited her belief that cannabis is a  in voting against the amendment.\n\nIn 2018, Feinstein softened her views on marijuana and cosponsored the , legislation that would protect states from federal interference regarding both medical and recreational use. She also supported legislation in 2015 to allow medical cannabis to be recommended to s in states where its use is legal.\n\n\n\nWhile delivering the commencement address at Stanford Stadium on June 13, 1994, Feinstein said:\n\n}}\n\nFeinstein was described during her lifetime as a  on matters of national security. She voted for the extension of the  and the  provisions in 2012. Feinstein also voted for President Trump's $675-billion  for FY 2019. Later in 2017, she criticized the banning of  enlistments in the military under the Trump administration.\n\n\nFeinstein co-sponsored  on May 12, 2011. She met with representatives of technology companies, including Google and Facebook, in January 2012. A Feinstein spokesperson said she \"is doing all she can to ensure that the bill is balanced and protects the intellectual property concerns of the content community without unfairly burdening legitimate businesses such as Internet search engines\".\n\nFollowing her 2012 vote to extend the  and the  provisions, and after the  involving the  (NSA), Feinstein promoted and supported measures to continue the information collection programs. Feinstein and  also defended the NSA's request to  for all the  about phone calls made within the U.S. and from the U.S. to other countries. They said the information gathered by intelligence on the phone communications is used to connect phone lines to terrorists and that it did not contain the content of the phone calls or messages. '''' wrote that she had a \"reputation as a staunch defender of NSA practices and [of] the White House's refusal to stand by collection activities targeting foreign leaders\".\n\nIn October 2013, Feinstein criticized the NSA for monitoring telephone calls of foreign leaders friendly to the U.S. In November 2013, she promoted the FISA Improvements Act bill, which included a \"backdoor search provision\" that allows intelligence agencies to continue certain  searches as long as they are logged and \"available for review\" to various agencies.\n\nIn June 2013, Feinstein called  a \"traitor\" after his leaks went public. In October 2013, she said she stood by that.\n\nIn 2014, Feinstein accused the  of snooping and removing files from congressional computers, saying that the \"CIA's search may well have violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution\". Several months later the CIA admitted to having hacked Senate Intelligence Committee computers. Feinstein's displeasure at having been spied on was contrasted with her support for government surveillance of US citizens, with public figures and privacy advocates such as  and Edward Snowden noting the apparent incongruity.\n\nAfter the 2016 , Feinstein and  sponsored a bill that would likely have criminalized all forms of  in electronic communication between citizens. The bill would have required technology companies to design their encryption so that they can provide law enforcement with user data in an \"intelligible format\" when required to do so by court order.\n\nIn 2020, Feinstein co sponsored the , which seeks to create a 19-member committee to decide a list of best practices websites must follow to be protected by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The EARN IT Act effectively outlaws end-to-end encryption, depriving the world of secure, private communications tools.\n\n\nFeinstein served on the , her time on the committee coinciding with the  and the debates on the  of terrorists and alleged terrorists. On the Senate floor on December 9, 2014, the day parts of the  were released to the public, Feinstein called the government's detention and interrogation program a \"stain on our values and on our history\".\n\n\nDuring the , Feinstein served on President 's steering committee in California and as a Carter delegate to the .

She and  chairman  signed a contract in 1983, making San Francisco the host of the .\n\nAs a  in the , Feinstein said she would support Clinton for the nomination. But after  became the presumptive nominee, she fully backed his candidacy. Days after Obama amassed enough delegates to win the nomination, Feinstein lent her Washington, D.C., home to Clinton and Obama for a private one-on-one meeting. She did not attend the  in  because she had fallen and broken her ankle earlier in the month.\n\n (center left) in 2017]]Feinstein chaired the  and acted as mistress of ceremonies, introducing each participant at the . She was the first woman to have presided over a U.S. presidential inauguration.\n\nAhead of the , Feinstein was one of 16 female Democratic senators to sign an October 20, 2013, letter endorsing  for president.\n\nAt an August 29, 2017, event in San Francisco, Feinstein expressed hope that Trump could become a good president. \"The question is whether he can learn and change\", she said. \"If so, I believe he can be a good president\". The next day, Feinstein released a clarifying statement: \"I've been strongly critical of President Trump when I disagree on policy and with his behavior... While I'm under no illusion that it's likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies, I want President Trump to change for the good of the country\".\n\nOn January 9, 2018, Feinstein caused a stir when, as ranking member of the , she released a transcript of its August 2017 interview with  co-founder  about the  regarding connections between Trump's campaign and the Russian government. She did this unilaterally after the committee's chairman, , refused to release the transcript.\n\nAs the  approached, Feinstein indicated her support for former Vice President . This came as a surprise to many pundits, due to the potential candidacy of fellow U.S. Senator from California , of whom Feinstein said \"I'm a big fan of Sen. Harris, and I work with her. But she's brand-new here, so it takes a little bit of time to get to know somebody.\"\n\n\n signs the  in the Oval Office, February 2, 2011. Feinstein is standing fourth from right.]]\nIn September 2005, Feinstein was one of five Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against Supreme Court nominee , saying that Roberts had \"failed to state his positions on such social controversies as abortion and the right to die\".\n\nIn January 2006, Feinstein said she would vote against Supreme Court nominee , but expressed disapproval of a filibuster: \"When it comes to filibustering a Supreme Court appointment, you really have to have something out there, whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to the surface. This is a man I might disagree with, [but] that doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court.\"\n\nOn July 12, 2009, Feinstein said the Senate would confirm Supreme Court nominee , praising her for her experience and for overcoming \"adversity and disadvantage\".\n\nAfter President Obama nominated  to the Supreme Court in March 2016, Feinstein met with Garland on April 6 and later called on Republicans to do \"this institution the credit of sitting down and meeting with him\".\n\nIn February 2017, Feinstein requested that Supreme Court nominee  provide information on cases in which he had assisted with decision-making. In mid-March, she sent him a letter saying her request had not been met. Feinstein stated her opposition to Gorsuch's nomination on April 3.\n\nAfter , Feinstein received a July 30, 2018, letter from  in which Ford accused Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s. Ford requested that her allegation be kept confidential. Feinstein did not refer the allegation to the FBI until September 14, 2018, after the  had completed its hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination and \"after leaks to the media about [the Ford allegation] had reached a 'fever pitch'\". She faced \"sharp scrutiny\" for her decision to keep quiet about the Ford allegation for several weeks; she responded that she kept the letter and Ford's identity confidential because Ford had requested it. Feinstein opposed Kavanaugh's nomination.

Shortly before the 2020 presidential election, Barrett was nominated to the Court following Justice 's death, and the nomination was intensely controversial. Feinstein opposed Barrett's nomination, but at the conclusion of the hearings, she hugged Republican Senator , saying, \"this has been one of the best set of hearings that I've participated in\". Outraged progressives responded by calling for Feinstein to step down from her leadership role on the committee. Barrett was confirmed to the Court. After the hearings, Senate Minority Leader  said he had had a \"long and serious\" talk with Feinstein.

He was a member of the   from 1988 to 1992, serving as chairman in 1991. He first ran for Congress in 1992 after his home in Mariposa was shifted to the 19th District, and lost in the Republican primary to Fresno businessman Tal Cloud.\n\nRadanovich won the Republican primary in 1994. In the general election, Radanovich faced six-term incumbent   in the following November election. Lehman had only defeated Cloud by 1,100 votes in the previous election cycle, and speculation had abounded that the 19th would not stay Democratic for long. Radanovich defeated Lehman by a shocking 17-point margin (56 percent to Lehman's 39 percent). It was one of the largest margins of defeat for an incumbent in a cycle that saw many tenured Democrats lose their seats.\n\nAccording to ''Wine Spectator,'' in 2003 Congressman Radanovich closed ''Radanovich Winery'' due to “the tough economic times currently facing many California wineries, the congressman said on Friday. \"It has been a painful decision,\" said Radanovich, 47. \"The past six months have been some of the most difficult that I've been through.\" ''SFGate'' reported on this as well saying, “Radanovich cited the current wine oversupply situation facing California vintners, the economic situation and his desire to focus on his job in Washington. The winery's tasting room has closed and some winery inventory will be sold to pay outstanding debts.”\n\nIn the 2006 election, Radanovich ran against chemical engineer , who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Cox was arguably Radanovich's most serious and well-funded challenger since his 1994 election. However, Michael Der Manouel Jr. commented on Cox's chances for election by saying, \"Cox could spend $10 million and  could spend another $10 million and Congressman Radanovich wouldn't lose.\"  Radanovich was reelected with 60% of the vote in 2006 and was unopposed for reelection in 2008 in what is now considered one of the most Republican districts in California. Cox was later elected to Congress in the 21st district in the 2018 elections.\n\nOn December 29, 2009, Radanovich announced he would not seek reelection in 2010.\n\n\nIn 2022, Radanovich ran for .

Elected to Congress in 1990, he served as a  member of the  from 1991 to 2009, representing  (numbered as  during his first term). In the , he held a leadership role as the  for the Republican party in the House. He was succeeded in the House of Representatives by . Before being elected to Congress, he had served in the California State Senate from 1984 to 1991.\n\nIn the approach to the 2008 election, Doolittle lost support from previous allies and had difficulty in fundraising. He announced that he would not run again. He had been criticized by opponents for improprieties, including using his wife's one-person firm for his political fundraising, as she based her compensation on a percentage of all funds raised, including from his PAC. She made nearly $180,000 in such commissions from 2001 to 2006. His office did not stop using her firm for fundraising until January 2007.\n\nHe was under investigation from 2006 to 2010 related to alleged financial improprieties. These included his and his wife's business relations with , a prominent   lobbyist who was found to have defrauded numerous clients, including Indian tribes. During this period,  (CREW) listed Doolittle as among the 20 most corrupt congressmen in reports from 2006 to 2009. The US Attorney closed its investigation of Doolittle in 2010 without bringing any charges against him.\n\n\nDoolittle was born in . He grew up in , attending local public schools. He graduated from  in 1968. He graduated with honors with a  in history from the . He earned a  degree from , , in , in 1978.\n\nBefore going to law school, Doolittle spent two years as a missionary in  for , to which he and his family belonged. Doolittle is married to the former Julia (Julie) Harlow. They have a son and daughter.\n\n\nDoolittle entered politics early. Soon after passing the bar, in 1979 Doolittle started work as an aide to California state senator , the conservative founder of  and the Law and Order Campaign Committee. \n\t\nThe next year Doolittle decided to run for the state senate, with encouragement from Richardson and other Republicans. Riding on the coattails of Governor 's victory in the presidential race, in 1980 the 29-year-old Doolittle narrowly defeated incumbent Democrat , dean of the state Senate and chair of the Senate Finance Committee. Doolittle won his seat in the .\n\nIn 1981, the Democratic-dominated state legislature issued a redistricting plan following the 1980 census and congressional reapportionment. It tried to squeeze out Republican lawmakers. The newly drawn district put Doolittle into a predominately Democratic district, where he lost to then-Assemblyman Leroy Greene in 1982 for the state senate. But by a quirk of redistricting rules, Doolittle was able to keep his original seat until 1984. He won another term in the state senate by beating , a Republican turned Independent from .Jeff Kearns,  , ''Sacramento News and Review'', 22 July 2004 An administrative law judge later found Doolittle guilty of violating campaign finance laws because his campaign had contributed to his Democratic opponent in order to pull votes away from Johnson.\n\nDoolittle easily won re-election in 1988. From 1987 to 1990, he was chairman of the state Senate Republican Caucus.\n\n\nIn 1990, Republican , also a Mormon, retired from Congress. In the November general election, Doolittle defeated Patty Malberg, a Democrat from , getting 51% of the vote, in what was then . The district covered much of the northeastern corner of the state, from the northern suburbs of  to the Oregon border.\n\nDoolittle's district was renumbered as  in 1992, following redistricting. He was reelected with 50 percent of the vote, again defeating Malberg. In 1994 he received 60% of the vote and did not face another close race until 2006.\n\n\nIn his first years in Congress, Doolittle was a member of the group known as the , which had a role in exposing the .\n\nDoolittle is a staunch conservative. According to the ''Associated Press'', \"Doolittle is a generally loyal supporter of the Bush administrationthough like many House Republicans he opposes Bush's support for an immigration guest worker program.\" He is in favor of partial privatization of Social Security, saying he would like to see people \"gain ownership over their own funds\". He opposes gun control and abortion rights.\n\nAfter the  had its funding removed in 1995, Doolittle helped revive it as the \"Conservative Action Team.\" He alternated the chairmanship with  of ,  of , and  of  until 1999.\n\nIn November 1997, Doolittle was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor  by  that sought to launch an  against President . The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to  Clinton, predating the eruption of the . The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Doolitte voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open . , Doolittle voted in favor of all four proposed  against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted).\n\nIn January 2006, an opinion piece published in ''The Union'' newspaper, of , quoted Doolittle as saying that \"A liberal front is underway to find God and all things pertaining to him unconstitutional.\"\n\nIn February 2006, Doolittle was praised by the El Dorado Irrigation District for his assistance in obtaining federal funds for  projects.\n\n\n\nDoolittle is known for support of the  project, despite environmental concerns. People who opposed construction of the dam were particularly concerned about the uncertainties of the potential effects of such a dam on  activity in the area. A mid-1990s preliminary  report cited concerns about the potential for s to be caused by that project.\n\nDoolittle's stated reason for supporting the Auburn Dam was for  of . After  in 2005, he portrayed the flooding in  as an example of why the project was needed. Critics replied that the Gulf Coast, with its hurricane season and the torrential rainfalls associated with it, is not a valid comparison to a region of the country that historically often has droughts. They said that  and  dams sufficed to control floods in an intense rainy season. Opponents of the project believe that the proposed Auburn Dam will also accelerate  east of Sacramento and downriver from the proposed dam.  already has one of the highest growth rates in the country, putting strains on local services and infrastructure, and affecting the environment. Opponents also cited other issues, such as destruction of the canyon environment and loss of habitat for wildlife.\n\nIn 1975, the construction of the dam was stopped due to environmental concerns, money issues, and the seismic instability of the proposed dam site. The construction was canceled and the project is abandoned. Much of the preliminary work on the dam can still be seen today. In 2005, Doolittle secured funding for studies to move the project forward.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Doolittle defeated Republican challenger Dr. Bill Kirby of , 78%–22%. In the general election, Doolittle defeated Mark Norberg, 65%-35%, while raising $1,024,986 compared to Norberg's $8,202.\n\n\nIn 2004, Doolittle took in more than $1 million in contributions and received 65% of the vote. His Democratic opponent David Winters raised $2,300; he won 35 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Republican  on June 6, 2006, Doolittle was challenged for his party's nomination by Mike Holmes, the mayor of Auburn. Doolittle raised more than $1.1 million in campaign contributions, more than 14 times the fund of Holmes. Doolittle won the primary with 67% of the vote.\n\nIn the , Doolittle's Democratic opponent was retired Air Force Lt. Colonel . Doolittle agreed to a single debate, on October 11, 2006. Doolittle defeated Brown, getting 49% of the vote to Brown's 46%. Brown defeated Doolittle in , but narrowly lost , the most populated county in the district, and lost the rest of the district.\n\nIn January 2007, Doolittle announced ten steps he said he would take to re-establish the confidence of the district in his holding office. He announced the planned changes in an op-ed piece he distributed to newspapers in his district, to attempt to gain free publicity about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Congress took up the reauthorization of the , which provides health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicare but not enough to afford health insurance. Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children and their families are often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.\n\nJohn Doolittle voted against the first House bill, which passed along party lines. It would have added $47 billion over five years to the $25 billion cost of the program and added about 5 million people to the program, including children, some legal immigrants, pregnant women, and adults aged 18 and 19. The bill was to be financed mainly by an increase in cigarette taxes.\n\nHouse Democrats, with 45 Republicans, later compromised and passed a bill that expanded the plan by $35 billion and would have insured about 3.5 million more children from families generally making between 250% and 300% of the federal poverty line (about $51,000 to $62,000 for a family of four). Most non-pregnant, childless adults were excluded, as were most legal immigrants and all illegal immigrants. Doolittle voted against the bill.\n\nAfter President Bush vetoed the bill, Democratic leaders attempted to override the veto with the same bill but failed. Doolittle voted against the bill.\n\nHouse Democrats attempted to override the veto with a new bill, which acceded to Republican demands for increased checks for citizenship, the quick phasing-out of adult coverage, a hard limit of 300% of the federal poverty level, and funding for families to cover their children through private insurance instead. Angry that the congressional vote was scheduled to proceed despite massive wildfires in California, Republicans blocked the veto override. Doolittle voted with fellow Republicans against the bill.\n\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, John Doolittle raised a total of $2,354,786 for his political campaign. 65.1% of his finances came from private donors, 34.5% from PACs, and 0.3% from other various sources. 54.3% of the PAC contributions came from business organizations while the other 45.7% came from labor and ideological groups. At the end of his 2005–2006 political campaign, 98.4% of his finances were completely disclosed. According to the FEC (), John Doolittle raised a total of $278,142 in that year.\n\n\nDoolittle was investigated by the US Attorney for issues related to his campaign financing and reporting, beginning in 2006. He and his wife both had business and political relations with , a prominent lobbyist in Washington, DC. Abramoff was investigated by a Congressional committee and found to have defrauded numerous clients, especially Indian tribes which he represented on gaming issues. Doolittle's wife had a consulting firm that Abramoff used for some activities. He required his Indian tribe clients to contribute some $50,000 to Doolittle's political campaigns and personally contributed another $14,000.\n\nOn September 20, 2006, the  (CREW), a non-profit group headed by former Democratic Congressional staffer Melanie Sloan, , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington released its second annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress. It was entitled ''Beyond DeLay: The 20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and Five to Watch)''. Doolittle was one of the 20 discussed in the report. The organization said, \"His ethics issues stem from his wife's relationship to his campaign and political action committees, as well as campaign contributions and personal financial benefits he accepted from those who sought his legislative assistance.\" He was also listed as among the most corrupt Congressmen in CREW's subsequent 2007 and 2008 reports.\n\nOn June 11, 2010, the U.S. Attorney announced that, after a 4-year investigation, they had closed its case against Congressman Doolittle and would not pursue charges. Doolittle, who had consistently denied wrongdoing, expressed regret that so many lives and careers had been affected by the investigation. He was forced from office by it. He said he was relieved that the investigation was ended.\n\n\n\nJohn Doolittle has been entangled in the scandal involving . On September 27, 2007, he indicated that he planned to fight a Justice Department subpoena for 11 years of records as part of that department's investigation into his conduct.\n\nDoolittle has denied any wrongdoing. In connection with the matter, he hired David Barger, a criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor from 's office, and , a law firm that specializes in campaign finance and government ethics. Doolittle has estimated that he received about $50,000 in contributions for his campaigns from clients of Abramoff, mostly Indian tribes. His congressional campaigns from 1999 to 2004 received $14,000 in personal donations from Abramoff over the period 1999–2004 to Doolittle's congressional campaigns. After Doolittle's Chief of Staff  left to work for Abramoff, Ring helped arrange for Abramoff to hire a consulting firm owned by Doolittle's wife. Doolittle used Abramoff's luxury sports box for a political fundraiser and failed to report this as part of his campaign finances. Doolittle was investigated by a federal probe into his relationship with Abramoff. On April 13, 2007, Doolittle's former aide, Kevin Ring, resigned from his lobby firm. On the same day, the  raided Doolittle's Virginia home. On September 4, 2007, the House announced that Doolittle's Chief of Staff Ron Rogers and Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Blankenburg were subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury.\n\n\nDan Landon, a Republican and the executive director of the Nevada County Transportation Commission, said that he was told recently by Doolittle's staff that \"it also doesn't hurt to have a lobbyist\". Sharon Atteberry, city administrator for the city of , said she had also been urged to hire a lobbyist by Doolittle's staff. \"They encouraged us that a lobbyist is very important to any city or county government\" she said.\n\n\nDuring the 2001–2005 period, Julie Doolittle had at least three different occupations: she worked for Jack Abramoff doing event planning (see above); she worked as a bookkeeper for a lobbying firm; and she worked on commission as a fundraiser for her husband. Payments to Julie Doolittle during the period were done via a company called Sierra Dominion Financial Solutions. It was founded in March 2001, just after Congressman Doolittle gained a seat on the Appropriations Committee. It is based at the couple's home in ; Julie is the only employee. The company (that is, Julie) has continued to do fundraising, but no event planning or other work, since the Abramoff scandal first became public in early 2005.\n\n\nFrom 2002 until mid-2005, the , a  lobbying firm with close ties to Congressman , paid Sierra Dominion for bookkeeping work for a nonprofit group called the  (KORUSEC). The latter was created by , a partner in the firm, and was located at the ASG headquarters. KORUSEC is also connected to , one of Doolittle's former assistants. ASG closed due to the financial scandals caused by  and his associates. Julie Doolittle's records regarding her work there were subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice.\n\n\nSierra Dominion charged Doolittle's campaign and his Superior California Political Action Committee a 15 percent commission on any contribution that Julie Doolittle helped bring in. Federal and state campaign records show that, since late 2001, she had received nearly $180,000 in commissions from for such fundraising. This meant that Doolittle and his family had personally made money off his political fundraising. Doolittle aides said even though the PAC had made payments to other fundraisers, Julie Doolittle was entitled to 15 percent of all money the PAC brought in because those donations were raised at events she helped organize.\n\nIn December 2005, Richard Robinson, Doolittle's Chief of Staff, defended the commission structure. \"Sierra Dominion's compensation is based entirely on performance in that it receives a percentage in what it is directly involved in raising. This arrangement is not only consistent with that of other fund raisers but is designed to avoid the appearance that Sierra Dominion is compensated for anything other than its tireless and effective work. Any suggestion otherwise is completely without merit.\"\n\nBut in 2006, the 27,000-member Association of Fundraising Professionals published a letter it had sent to Doolittle, stating emphatically that his wife's activities and form of compensation violated the Association's ethics code. Their code \"explicitly prohibits percentage-based compensation\".\n\nIn January 2007, Doolittle announced that he would no longer employ his wife as his campaign fundraiser. Instead, he said, he would hire an outside fundraiser., ''Associated Press'', January 12, 2007 But in July 2007, his campaign reported expenses of $50,000 for fundraising by Sierra Dominion Financial Solutions during the April–June 2007 period. The company was also still owed $76,000 in commissions from the 2006 race.David Whitney,  , ''Sacramento Bee'', July 16, 2007\n\n\nKORUSEC, which employed Doolittle's wife (see above) and the U.S.-Malaysia Exchange Association, another non-profit firm operated by ASG, paid the total $29,400 cost of what was described as a \"fact finding mission\" in 2005 for Congressman Doolittle and his 12-year-old daughter to South Korea and Malaysia. This trip included a stop at the Berjaya Beach & Spa Resort on the Malaysian island of .\n\nKORUSEC and the U.S.-Malaysia Exchange Association, which were operated by the Washington lobbying firm, , were, as of November 2006, being investigated by the  as possible conduits for illegal influence in U.S. affairs; foreign corporations such as KORUSEC and foreign governments, such as USMEA, are prohibited from seeking such influence. A spokeswoman for Doolittle said that he believed that his trip was proper and that it had nothing to do with the earmarks he had approved in the federal budget.\n\n\n is a company owned by ; Doolittle has had significant involvement with both the company and its owner. Disgraced Congressman  admitted receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and favors from Wilkes for his efforts to help another of Wilkes' companies, ADCS Inc.\n\nIn 2002, Wilkes hired the  (ASG) for lobbying for his company. In November 2003, Wilkes hosted a fund-raising dinner for Congressman Doolittle. Between 2002 and 2005, Doolittle received at least $118,000 in campaign contributions from Wilkes, PerfectWave associates and their wives, and ASG lobbyists  and  (two former aides of ) and their wives.\n\nDoolittle, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in January 2006 that he had helped steer defense funds totaling $37 million to PerfectWave ($1 million in 2002, $18 million in 2003, and then $18 million in 2004.) Doolittle said that his support was based \"on the project's merits and the written support of the military.\"\n\nBut the '''' reported that \"The money was not requested by the Navy but was instead inserted by the Appropriations Committee as part of the closed-door congressional ing process.\" They further reported that \"[T]he only evidence Doolittle's office could provide to show military support for the project was a letter of praise from Robert Lusardi, a program manager for light armored vehicles at the Marine Corps dated Feb. 25two and a half years after PerfectWave got its first earmark. By the time Lusardi wrote his letter, the company had received at least $37 million in earmarks.\"\n\nIn February 2006, Doolittle said that he was glad he supported PerfectWave, saying \"it has unique technology ... that ensures the safety of our armed forces in the war on terror.\"\n\n\nOn January 8, 2006, the '''' reported that \"Reps. John T. Doolittle and  joined forces with former House Majority Leader  of  to oppose an investigation by federal banking regulators into the affairs of Houston millionaire , documents recently obtained by ''The Times'' show.\" \"When the FDIC persisted [in seeking investigation], Doolittle and Pomboboth considered proteges of DeLayused their power as members of the House Resources Committee to subpoena the agency's confidential records on the case, including details of the evidence FDIC investigators had compiled on Hurwitz.\" The FDIC investigation was ultimately dropped.\n\nThe Times reported that \"Although Washington politicians frequently try to help important constituents and contributors, it is unusual for members of Congress to take direct steps to stymie an ongoing investigation by an agency such as the FDIC.\" The article concluded, \"in the Hurwitz case, Doolittle and Pombo were in a position to pressure the FDIC and did so.\"\n\nOn April 19, 2007, Doolittle resigned from the Committee on Appropriations in response to a raid by the FBI at his Northern Virginia home. The raid stemmed from possible involvement by his wife in the investigation of  for defrauding clients as a lobbyist and inappropriate influence.Werner, Erica (April 19, 2007). , , ''SF Gate''\n\n\n\n\nDemocrat , a retired Lt. Colonel who had narrowly lost to Doolittle in 2006 by 3 percent of the vote, announced in February 2007 that he would run again in 2008. In the first and second quarters of 2007, Brown raised more campaign funds than Doolittle; as of June 30, he had a net cash balance of $251,000; Doolittle had a negative balance of $32,000. Analysts believed that the continuing corruption investigation caused the decline in support for Doolittle.\n\nIn August 2007, former  Republican Party chairman Ken Campbell, a longtime financial backer of Doolittle, said he was withdrawing his support. Campbell cited a recent  report on votes in 2007 on spending bills, where Doolittle scored 2 percent, compared to the Republican average of 43 percent.\n\nIn July 2007, Eric Egland, a 37-year-old Air Force reservist and security consultant, announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for the seat held by Doolittle. In August 2007,  City Councilman Mike Holmes announced that he also was entering the 2008 race. Holmes ran unsuccessfully against Doolittle in the primary for the Republican nomination in 2006, getting 33 percent of the primary vote to 67 percent for Doolittle.\n\nOn August 30, 2007, State Assemblyman Ted Gaines announced the establishment of an exploratory committee to begin raising money to run for Congress against Doolittle, stating \"I think voters have lost faith in his leadership ability ... when you lose the moral ability to lead, you kind of have to re-evaluate.\"Peter Hecht, , ''Sacramento Bee'', 30 August 2007\n\nDoolittle said, \"After spending the last month talking to local voters, I have seen strong support for my candidacy and a strong desire to focus on solving problems instead of plotting for political advantage ... I will gladly place before the voters my record of over 30 years of service to the Republican Party to Ted Gaines' less than one year.\"\n\nAfter much speculation, on January 10, 2008, John Doolittle announced he would finish his current term, but would not run for re-election.\n\nAfter Doolittle's retirement announcement, Councilman Holmes quit the race and instead endorsed former Republican Congressman , who announced on February 1, 2008, that he is running for Doolittle's seat. Ose faced opposition from former California State Senator  (R-San Andreas), who announced his candidacy on January 10, 2008.  When California State Senator  (R-Thousand Oaks) announced that he too was running for Doolittle's seat on March 4, 2008, Oller dropped out of the race, and decided to give his endorsement to McClintock. Although he didn't live in the district, McClintock beat Charlie Brown in the general election by only 1,800 votes.\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n*  at \n*  – Official campaign site\n* Legislation sponsored or cosponsored\n** 107th Congress    \n** 108th Congress    \n** 109th Congress    \n** 110th Congress    \n'''Articles'''\n*  Dennis Zaki, ''AlaskaReport.com'', September 27, 2007\n*  Susan Schmidt and James V.

She lives in Los Gatos, California with her husband, Stephen, an independent adoption attorney. She has three children, two granddaughters and one grandson.\n\n\nRavel has served as Chair of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and led the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC).\n\nPrior to joining the FEC, Ravel was appointed by California   in February 2011 to serve as the Chair of the  (FPPC). At the FPPC, Ravel oversaw the regulation of campaign finance, lobbyist registration and reporting, and ethics and conflicts of interest related to officeholders and public employees. In Ravel's most significant case as chair, the FPPC pursued a year-long investigation into the methods used by donors who seek to influence political campaigns by anonymous methods.  In October 2013, the FPPC fined the center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership $1 million for forwarding $15 million in \"dark money\" contributions to a California committee without disclosing the source of those contributions. Ravel testified about the case before the Senate Rules and Administration Committee considering the issue of nondisclosure by political groups on April 30, 2014. While at the FPPC, Ravel sought to leverage technology to \"enhance efficiency, improve governance and repair the relationship between the public and their government.\" To that end, the FPPC adopted regulations to allow political contributions to be made by text message and created an online, searchable database of California public officials' Statements of Economic Interests. During Ravel's tenure, the FPPC also released a mobile phone application to track gifts received by public officials and held a hackathon to explore creative options to better disclose the Agency's public data. As Chair of the FPPC, Ravel created the Regulation Clarification Project, an effort to clarify and streamline California regulations. This project was designed to make the law more understandable to the public, promote easier and less onerous compliance for state and local officials, and ensure that the regulations complied with the governing statutes and courts decisions. Among other changes, the FPPC created guides to analyze gift laws and reorganized the regulations by topic. During her tenure at the FPPC, she established the States Unified Network (SUN) Center, a nonpartisan group of state and local jurisdictions promoting transparency in campaign finance.  The group shares enforcement, litigation, and campaign finance data through a public website, which provides nationwide disclosure and aids in enforcement.\n\nBefore joining the FPPC, Ravel was  Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Torts and Consumer Litigation in the Civil Division of the .  She also worked as an attorney in the Santa Clara County Counsel's Office, ultimately serving as the appointed County Counsel from 1998 until 2009.  Ravel represented the county and its elected officials, provided advice on the state Political Reform Act, initiated programs in elder abuse litigation, educational rights, and consumer litigation on behalf of the Santa Clara County government and the community, and joined a group of California municipal attorneys suing to overturn the state's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nRavel has served as an elected Governor on the Board of Governors of the State Bar of California, a member of the , and Chair of the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation. Ravel received the Professional Woman of Achievement Award from the San Jose Mercury News and the Commission on the Status of Women in 1980, the Elizabeth Ent Award for her contributions to law and justice in 1995, and the Circle of Service Achievement Award from the California State Association of Counties in 2004. In 2007, the State Bar of California recognized Ravel's contributions to public service, naming her Public Attorney of the Year. In 2014, she was named as a California Attorney of the Year by ''California Lawyer'' magazine for her contributions to Government law.\n\nRavel was appointed member of the  (FEC) by  on June 21, 2013, and took office on October 25, 2013, after being confirmation by the . On October 24, 2014, Ravel called for \"a reexamination of the commission's approach to the internet and other emerging technologies...\"  \"The suggestion on its face should have been non-controversial: 'As a Commission, we need to consider the changing role of technology in our elections and recognize how technology is changing our politics. For that reason, next year, I will bring together technologists, social entrepreneurs, policy wonks, politicos, and activistsfrom across the spectrumto discuss new and emerging technologies and how the Commission's current approach may or may not fit with future innovations.'\" Then-FEC chairman  \"characterized the suggestion as an attempt to regulate speech.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Ravel told the New York Times that it is unlikely that the FEC will be able to regulate the coming 2016 presidential election. \"The likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim,\" she told The New York Times. \"I never want to give up, but I'm not under any illusions. People think the FEC is dysfunctional. It's worse than dysfunctional.\" Ravel resigned from the FEC on February 19, 2017, effective March 1, 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Ravel began a campaign for California state senator. During the campaign, Ravel attracted controversy for her past opposition to the recall of  over his handling of the  including from  who led the petition drive for the recall campaign with Dauber and other leaders of the recall campaign releasing an open letter critical of Ravel and her employer attorney James \"Jim\" McManis who also opposed the recall and claimed  consented to Brock Turner's sexual assault with the letter calling on Ravel to return McManis's $2,000 campaign donation. McManis told a Vogue reporter that \"This woman (Miller) was not attacked...\". Ravel said she only defended Persky against the recall \"on principle\" and still supports the campaign against the recall's \"underlying cause\". Democratic Activists for Women Now (DAWN) then voted to rescind its endorsement of Ravel as a result of refusing to return McManis's campaign donation and her opposition to .\n\nRavel also received criticism, mainly from rival candidate , from receiving campaign donations from insurance companies and related  such as the Personal Insurance Federation of California Agents & Employees PAC and the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company Federal PAC despite Ravel insisting she would run a grassroots campaign and thus wouldn't accept contributions from PACs such as the campaign donations in question.\n\nOn March 3, 2020, in California's  concurrent with then , Ravel placed in 2nd place and thus was able to move on to the general election with then- for District 3  placing in 1st place.

Whitman's campaign released documents which she said Santillan provided prior to her employment including a driver's license, social security ID, and application. Santillan said Whitman knew she was undocumented, producing a 2003 letter from the Social Security Administration stating that her Social Security number did not match her name. Whitman initially stated that they \"never received those letters\", however, after a hand-written note on the document was shown, believed to be from Whitman's husband, they acknowledged they may have received it, but forgot.

Brown, Allred and Santillan all denied this.Skelton, George, , ''Los Angeles Times'', October 4, 2010.\n\nCrystal Williams, director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, stated, \"Not only is accepting the documents all the law required [Whitman] to do, but there's a counterbalancing anti-discrimination law that keeps her from probing further or demanding different documents.\" Others disagreed; immigration lawyer Greg Siskind stated Whitman was the employer, and the documents by law needed to be signed by her but were not, nor did they have a Social Security number on them. The ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' noted that Whitman \"hired her, paid her and had direct contact with her for nine years\", so should have known her legal status.

Whitman later resigned from the Goldman Sachs board after some expressed concern over her receiving shares from Goldman Sachs. In commenting on Whitman's resignation from the Goldman Sachs board, eBay spokesman Henry Gomez told ''The Wall Street Journal'' at the time that, \"If we wanted to use Goldman's services, she doesn't want there to be even the slightest perception of any conflict. She's doing this because she thinks quite highly of the firm.\" While Whitman was on Goldman Sachs' board, she served on the compensation committee, which approved multimillion-dollar bonus packages for then-CEO  and his top aides. Public domain documents reveal that Whitman has a multimillion-dollar stake in 21 investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. Given Goldman Sachs' major investments in California state finances, all these ties to Goldman Sachs led to considerable controversy during the gubernatorial campaign.

She said that, if she had lived in California in 1994, she would have voted against  concerning illegal immigrants.\n In an op-ed during her gubernatorial campaign, Whitman wrote, \"Clearly, when examining our positions on immigration, there is very little over which Jerry Brown and I disagree\".\n\nShe stated that illegal immigrant students should be prohibited from attending state-funded institutions of higher education., New York Times, June 18, 2010. Currently, California state law permits this. In 2009, Whitman called for \"a path to legalization\" of illegal immigrants.

Whitman also criticized Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and  Jerry Brown for not defending Proposition 8 in the federal judicial system. However, on February 26, 2013, Whitman confirmed that she had reversed that opinion. Whitman stated, \"At the time, I believed the people of California had weighed in on this question and that overturning the will of the people was the wrong approach,\" and \"The facts and arguments presented during the legal process since then have had a profound impact on my thinking.\" Whitman also believes that gay and lesbian couples should be permitted to adopt children.\n\n\nWhitman supports .\n\n\nWhitman has said that the legalization of  is not what any law enforcement person would suggest for any reason and that \"this is the worst idea [she has] ever seen.\"\n\n\nWhitman does not support the  project. In a 2010 letter to the '''' Whitman's spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said, \"Meg believes the state cannot afford the costs associated with high-speed rail due to our current fiscal crisis.\" Her opponent Jerry Brown was in favor of the project.\n\nWhitman has made monetary donations to various candidates and s (PAC). While these have gone to both Republicans and , the donations are weighted to Republicans. Though Whitman has contributed to a few Democrats, including Senator ; donating $4,000 to her campaign and serving on the \"Friends of Boxer\" committee in 2004, she donated more than $225,000 during the same period to Republicans, eBay's PAC and to Americans for a Republican Majority, the PAC of former Congressman .\n\n\nIn 2017, Whitman was the Commencement speaker for  and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree.\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n* ''official campaign site''\n*, '''', March 6, 2007\n* , Sheelah Kolhatkar, ''Time Magazine'', December 14, 2009\n*, ''Vitals'', June 9, 2010\n* Video produced by ''''\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the first quarter of 2019, Ma sold more bonds than any other state treasurer in America, including a different bond issuance almost every week during March and April. From July to December 2019, her office sold an additional $7.65 billion of bonds. In November 2019, the nonpartisan  reported on the Treasurer's cost-cutting impact stating: \"the State Treasurer has been able to refinance much of the state's bond debt. Consequently, much of the state's outstanding debt now carries a lower interest rate resulting in lower annual costs.\"\nOverall in 2019, Ma's office oversaw $85 billion in bonds and $85 billion to $100 billion (an all-time high) in short term investments. \"I believe in checks and balances, accountability and also being proactive,\" Ma told Bloomberg news.

She also co-sponsored the California Recycling Market Development Act to promote California's recycling programs, AB 1583 authored by Assemblymember Susan Eggman and signed in to law by Governor Newsom.\nMa also chairs the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA), which assists the state in meeting its greenhouse gas goals and works with the private market.

Ma also chairs the California Pollution Control Financing Authority (CPCFA), providing $16.2 billion in low-cost financing. CPCFA was the first statewide financing authority to sign the Green Bond Pledge, vowing to meet climate bond principles in all of its projects. In December 2020, Ma's office enrolled the 1,000th loan of the Residential Energy Efficiency Loan Program, to a Yuba County homeowner to install a highly efficient HVAC and smart thermostat.\n\n\nMa's office oversees private activity bonds and state housing tax credits that are used to build and maintain low-income housing and keep rents in these units affordable for 55 years. In 2019, her office sold over $180 million of bonds for the California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) program to provide affordable loans to veterans. \nMa also sold $500 million (in 2019) and $450 million (in 2020) in revenue bonds for California's No Place Like Home (NPLH) program, an effort to develop permanent supportive housing for homeless and mentally ill people. This \"social bond,\" to fund projects that produce positive social outcomes, won the Bond Buyer Magazine's Deal of the Year award in 2020.\nIn September 2020, Ma released policy reports on affordable housing for community college students, working with the Southern California Association of Non-Profit Housing. With the California School Finance Authority (CSFA), Ma's office issued $87 million in bonds to build 352 beds for Santa Rosa Junior College.\nIn October 2020, the CTCAC chaired by Ma approved $91 million in tax credits for 2,846 units of low-income housing in counties heavily damaged by the Camp, Tubbs, Thomas, and Mendocino Complex wildfires in 2017 and 2018.\n\n\nIn June 2019, Ma announced the launch of the CalSavers Retirement Savings Program, which offers an IRA retirement savings option to employees who don't currently have one through their employer. \n\nIn 2019, the \"Scholar Dollars\" program as part of ScholarShare 529 awarded more than $300,000 to 20 K-8 California public schools to fund technology, music, art, theater, computer science, sports, and other programs. In 2020, Ma sponsored a law to protect ScholarShare 529 accounts from being seized by debt collectors.\n\nAs part of Governor 's Master Plan for Aging, Ma co-sponsored three bills addressing the needs of older adults, people with disabilities and family caregivers: AB 1287 (Nazarian), AB 1382 (Aguiar-Curry), and SB 611(Cabellero). In 2019, the Treasurer Office's CalABLE program was expanded to allow anyone with a disability diagnosed before the age of 26 to\nopen up an account and save up to $15,000 a year.\n\nIn 2020, as part of the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (iBank), Ma began administering the California Rebuilding Fund, a new public-private partnership to support California's small businesses. The fund is part of the .\n\n\nIn her first year as treasurer, Ma appointed Dr Beverly Scott, adjunct professor at the  of , and Frederick Jordan, president of Bay Area construction company F.E. Jordan Associates Inc, to the . Ma also provided support to the SoCal-to-Las Vegas  high-speed rail project connecting  and  when she announced approval of a $300 million bond issuance for the project. \n\n\nIn 2019, Ma sponsored SB 51, by Senator Majority Leader Bob Hertzberg, to allow private banks and credit unions to apply for state licensing which would allow licensed cannabis-related businesses to open accounts and deposit income.\n\n\nOn April 25, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation that Ma had pushed to require out-of-state and online retailers like , , and  to collect sales taxes in line with the practices of local California businesses, eliminating an unfair advantage that Amazon and other out-of-state and online businesses had claimed. \n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 2020, all Ma's operations were considered essential services and kept fully-open and operational. Ma's office and agencies she chaired took the following actions:\n* assembled resources for taxpayer relief, food sources for needy families, and financial resources for small business. \n* Extended deadlines for business for the CalSavers retirement program and supported Governor Newsom and the State Franchise Tax Board in extending deadlines for California tax returns.\n* Launched $5 million emergency loan program for hospitals and health facilities in small, rural and district communities.\n* Increased bond money available to build additional 4,054 units of affordable housing including the first housing to target LGBT elders in the Davis region.\n* Pushed forward on $600 million in bonds for the Southern California to Las Vegas high speed rail project including 1,250 workforce housing units, 30,000 construction jobs and 1,000 permanent jobs.\nIn May 2020, Ma began operating the COVID-19 Emergency HELP Loan Program to provide financial assistance to health facilities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nBy May 2020, California had spent $2.2 billion on safety gear to prevent coronavirus infection. No-bid contracts were used because of the emergency and unprecedented need for personal protective equipment. The state's standard purchasing processes were disrupted and Ma's office, which normally just carries out final stages of financial transactions, took on an oversight role.\n\n\n\nOn August 30, 2023, Ma sent letters  to , , ,  , ,  and , telling them to return to negotiations and settle the strikes. \n\n\nIn summer of 2021, a former staffer filed a civil rights complaint against Ma, alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termination for declining the harassing behavior. In court filings, Judith Blackwell complained that Ma created a hostile work environment by making overt and unwanted advances while the two shared a hotel room on work trips. Such behavior included exposing her bare rear end to Blackwell on multiple occasions. Ma also gave Blackwell many gifts, such as jewelry, a prime parking spot and marijuana edibles, up until the time she was fired according to Politico. Ma is also accused of accepting inappropriate gifts.\n\nMa had also shared hotel rooms 13 times with her chief of staff over a two-year period. And while the practice of sharing rooms with subordinates does not violate departmental policy, the situation was criticized. Ma has denied any wrongdoing in her defense against Blackwell and said the sharing of hotel rooms was a cost-saving measure.\n\nShe is married to Jason Hodge, a  firefighter of  descent and an Oxnard Port Commissioner with the  in Ventura County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA priority for Ma while on the Board of Equalization was to get everyone to pay \"their fair share of taxes\", particularly \"the $8 billion in unpaid taxes in the .\" This included efforts to get  to collect sales tax on transactions from  as a way of helping local  retailers to compete – estimated at between $431 million and $1.8 billion in new revenue for California every year.\nIn her first year, Ma also advocated for  to be taxed like tobacco products, as a way to deter vaping and smoking, and to pay for health-costs caused by tobacco use. Two years later in 2017, voters passed  with a nearly 2/3 majority, collecting $1.7 billion in new tobacco taxes which was spent on anti-smoking programs and funding  payments for the poor.\nMa also identified the  as \"the largest shadow economy in California\" with \"hundreds of millions of dollars that disappear into an underground cannabis economy\".\n\n\nAfter 2015's , Ma  proposed a new law (enacted the following year) that granted some tax relief to businesses that suffer losses from a  like the Valley Fire. \nMa has also actively supported California's Earned Income Tax Credit to give cash back to low-income individuals, and promoted expansion of the program to minimum wage earners and s.\n\n\nWithin months of joining the Board of Equalization, Ma became \"very, very frustrated\" with the agency's fiscal conditions and mishandling of state tax accounts. She initiated three external audits of the agency. The audits exposed a culture of mismanagement,  and political use of state resources. Ma co-sponsored legislation to toughen campaign reporting requirements for BOE members. She then led the effort to ask the Governor to appoint a public trustee to take over the agency, and called on   to assign independent legal counsel for the agency. Ma laid out a list of reforms which was incorporated into the \"Taxpayer Transparency and Fairness Act of 2017\", the biggest restructuring of the Board of Equalization in its 138-year history. The law was signed by   in June 2017 and supported by  ,  , and former BOE member  .\n\n\nIn 2016, she received 's Woman of the Year Award and was a speaker at the Ascend Conference, the largest non-profit Pan-Asian business conference in America. Among her many other activities, Ma also celebrated  at the  in  and spoke to students at the Future Chinese Leaders of America in .\n\n\nOn February 23, 2007, Ma introduced a bill requiring commercial exhibitors of  corpses to obtain a county permit, which would be dependent on proof of consent from the decedent or next of kin. It passed the Senate on August 15, 2008 and was vetoed by Governor  on September 26, citing a budget delay.\n\n\nMa has passed legislation banning some chemicals in plastics and children's toys. As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed an ordinance to \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article…if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\" As a California State Legislator she passed a similar bill. This language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Greuel was the second woman elected to citywide office in Los Angeles, after her predecessor .\n\nPreviously, she served as a member of the  from 2002 to 2009, where she served as President Pro Tempore and represented the 2nd District, which includes portions of the . Greuel was a candidate for  in 2013, losing to , followed by a loss running for .\n\nShe was the first woman to advance to a Los Angeles mayoral runoff, performing better than previous female candidates Linda Griego in 1993,  in 2001 and  also in 2013.\n\n\nShe was born and raised in the , the daughter of a Christian church founder. January 29, 2012 Greuel graduated from  and served as student body president. During high school, she served as a member of then-Mayor Tom Bradley's Youth Council. She continued her education at the , during which time she interned for Councilman , Mayor  and the City of Los Angeles's office in Washington DC.\n\n\nUpon graduation, Greuel worked in Mayor Bradley's office for ten years, serving as Bradley's liaison to the City Council, city departments, and the community on public policy issues ranging from child care to homelessness to senior care and health issues.\n\nDuring this time, she established the city's first AIDS coordinator, secured funding from the City Council for condoms and bleach to stop the spread of AIDS, worked to find housing for L.A.'s homeless population, including Vietnam War veterans, and helped to create LA's Best, a nationally recognized after-school program for public elementary school students.\n\n\nFrom 1993 to 1997, Greuel worked in the administration of President . She served with Housing and Urban Development Cabinet Secretaries  and , first as the deputy director of the Interagency Council on Homelessness and later as the field operations officer for Southern California, where she became involved in projects offering opportunities for home ownership, job creation, economic development and social services. During her tenure, she managed HUD's response to the , which included securing over $1 billion in federal funding for recovery efforts.\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 2002, Greuel worked as an executive in government and community affairs for , an entertainment studio in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Greuel won a  against Assemblyman  to fill the remainder of the term of second district Los Angeles Councilman . She was elected to a full term in 2003 and re-elected in 2007. She served until July 2009, when she was elected to the office of .\n\nAt the time of her departure from the City Council, she was President Pro Tempore, chair of the Transportation Committee and Ad-Hoc Committee on Business Tax Reform, vice chair of the Budget and Finance Committee, and member of the Audits and Governmental Efficiency and Energy and Environment Committees.\n\nAs Chair of the Transportation Committee, Greuel added 450 left-turn signals to city streets and led a program to synchronize city traffic lights. She also banned road construction during rush hour and created anti-gridlock zones throughout the city to prevent motorists from parking on major thoroughfares during rush hour.\n\nAs Chair of the Ad-Hoc Committee on Business Tax Reform, she implemented a business tax reform proposal in 2003 that reduced business taxes by 15% overall, eliminated all business taxes for companies with gross receipts under $100,000 annually and has returned nearly $100 million to local small businesses.\n\nAs a member of the Energy and Environment Committee, Greuel preserved nearly 1,200 acres of open space, including securing funding to purchase 225 acres in the Verdugo Mountains to create the sixth largest passive park in the city. She championed the Scenic Preservation Corridor Plan, which prevents development along the Verdugo's ridge lines. Greuel banned smoking in farmers markets  and proposed that all new buildings be wired for solar technology.\n\nThrough her position on the Audits and Governmental Efficiency Committee, Greuel helped establish the Office of Public Safety in 2004, which consolidated all city-operated security forces (other than the ) and created the Police Fund, a program through which any elected official could address inefficiencies and allocate the money saved to the hiring of new police officers.\n\nShe developed the Stolen Vehicle Recovery Program, which enabled Department of Transportation officers (rather than ) to tow stolen vehicles, allowing police officers more time to respond to violent crime. Greuel also implemented the 50/50 sidewalk program, expediting sidewalk repairs when neighbors contributed 50% of the cost, created the Waste, Fraud, and Abuse Investigative Unit in the City Controller's office and banned political fundraising among City Commissioners.\n\nGreuel launched a district-wide anti-graffiti campaign and pushed to increase the number of neighborhood watch organizations in her district. She also implemented a safety valet program designed to ensure that all elementary school students were supervised entering and exiting schools.\n\nIn 2004, Greuel was an instrumental part of a major controversy in a neighborhood in her district when she chose to close a pedestrian bridge. There was a dispute between homeowners on the north side of the  and renters on the south side. Parking was an issue for the renters; they would use the north side neighborhood as overflow parking and cross the pedestrian bridge to their homes. Without any warning, the bridge was closed in 2005. The renters called for a town hall meeting, after which the bridge remained closed. The LAPD then became involved, saying they would close the bridge for 90 days to see if crime rates (the reason the homeowners cited to close the bridge) were affected. Near the end of the trial period, another town hall meeting was called and the officer in charge said that there was no significant change in the crime rates on the north side of the bridge. In the days before the final recommendation from the LAPD was to be released, this officer was discharged from the case and another officer was put in charge. This second officer recommended the bridge be closed for unknown reasons. This remains a point of contention in the renters' neighborhood, as parking is sparse and residents often have to walk blocks to get home while the bridge remains closed. Greuel stayed adamant that the decision to close the bridge was about crime, not parking: \"We've received a variety of complaints from people on the bridge side of graffiti, vandalism, drug sales.\" The police study during those 90 days, however, refuted those claims.\n\n\n\nGreuel defeated  and Kathleen Suzy Evans on March 3, 2009, to become the City Controller of Los Angeles. She took office on July 1, 2009.\n\n\n\nBy the end of her four-year term, Greuel's office claimed that she had identified over $160 million in waste, fraud and abuse. This assertion emerged as an issue during her 2013 mayoral campaign when her opponent Eric Garcetti argued that the amount was misleading as only several million dollars had actually been recovered. Greuel responded that she had in fact identified over $160 million but that the responsibility for recovering the money belonged to the Mayor and City Council.\n\nIn November 2009 and through a follow-up audit in November 2011, Greuel tracked the progress of the LAPD's backlog of untested rape kits. While the department made significant progress in reducing the backlog, Greuel made a series of recommendations to ensure future rape kits would not sit untested on the department's shelves.\n\nIn November 2011, Greuel expanded the city's Waste, Fraud, and Abuse hotline to accommodate whistleblower tips in more than 150 languages. A tip in 2012 led to Greuel's audit of the Department of Recreation and Parks that found that the city had spent $2 million to house caretakers at two of its remote camps that had been closed for thirteen and twenty years, respectively.\n\nIn October 2011, Greuel called for the city to transition to performance based budgeting, a system that requires departments to plan based on specific goals, rather than the line-item budgeting being used. Mayor Eric Garcetti adopted Greuel's recommendation when developing his first budget for Fiscal Year 2014.\n\nIn May 2011, Greuel audited the city's cell phone use and found that the city wasted as much as $1 million annually by overpaying cellphone carriers and maintaining hundreds of phones that were not in use for months at a time, among other practices.\n\nIn October 2010, then-City Attorney  announced a series of reforms to the workers compensation unit in his office after Greuel uncovered that the unit took too long to settle cases and failed to collect millions of dollars it was due. In 2008, Greuel's predecessor, Controller  had attempted to audit then-City Attorney 's workers compensation unit; however, when Chick issued subpoenas to six of his employees, he sued to block her efforts. Greuel and Trutanich inherited the lawsuit; when a judge ruled in favor of the City Attorney, Greuel appealed the decision, arguing that the City Controller should have the authority to audit all city departments, including elected officials. In October 2011, an appeals court neglected to say whether elected officials could be audited.\n\nAlso in October 2010, Greuel penned an op-ed in The Nation with then-Public Advocate, current New York City Mayor  blasting the Citizens United decision and announcing that they had joined with leaders from other states to found the Coalition for Accountability in Political Spending to encourage corporations to be transparent about their political spending.\n\nIn August 2010, in the aftermath of the pay scandal in the City of Bell, Greuel unveiled a comprehensive list of city employee salaries on her website, making Los Angeles the largest city in the United States to make this information public.\n\nIn July 2010, Greuel reported in one of her audits that the City of Los Angeles had failed to collect over $260 million in traffic tickets and other debts owed to the city, 47% of all debts.\n\nIn July 2009, Greuel announced that her Delinquent Taxpayer Program had successfully collected nearly $3 million from 16 delinquent taxpayers in just four months. She stated that over $107 million in delinquent taxes was still to be collected.\n\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the ''Los Cerritos News'' published Greuel's public schedule since taking office as Los Angeles City Controller. The article alleged that \"she has spent an overwhelming majority of her official schedule for the past three years attending lavish dinners, lunches, breakfasts, and social events in an effort to advance her 2013 mayoral campaign\" in possible violation of the Los Angeles Governmental Ethics Commission Ordinance.\n\n\n\nGreuel was a candidate for  in the . In the primary election, she placed second to Eric Garcetti and came ahead of Jan Perry, Kevin James and Emanuel Pleitez, thereby advancing to the runoff. Her candidacy was endorsed by a number of public officials including former President , former Mayor , LA County Supervisors Gloria Molina and Mark Ridley-Thomas, State Assembly Speaker John Perez and former Speaker Bob Hertzberg and labor leader . She ultimately lost the general election to , who became Mayor on July 1, 2013. Had she been elected, Greuel would have been the city's first woman Mayor. She was the first woman to advance to a Los Angeles mayoral runoff, performing better than previous female candidates Linda Griego in 1993, Kathleen Connell in 2001 and Jan Perry in 2013.\n\nAfter the election, Greuel was viewed as a potentially formidable candidate to replace outgoing LA County Supervisor . However, on January 9, 2014, she announced that she would not be a candidate in the open race.\n\n\nGreuel currently works as a consultant to both the Discovery Cube Science Center in the San Fernando Valley and the  David Nazarian College of Business and Economics. Mayor Garcetti appointed Greuel as Chairwoman of the  and Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl appointed her to the Governing Council of the Los Angeles County Initiative on Women and Girls.\n\nShe is a member of the Boards of Directors of Abode Communities, the Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment (CAUSE), , , the , the Los Angeles YMCA, and , the advisory board of The Everychild Foundation, the President's Advisory Council of The Fulfillment Fund, and was one of eleven members of the LA Unified Advisory Task Force, charged with advising LAUSD Superintendent Michelle King.\n\n\nGreuel is married to attorney Dean Schramm, whom she met during her 2002 campaign; they have a son, born in 2003. Schramm is a former president of the  - Los Angeles Executive Board, was active in its \"Darfur Task Force\" and was the executive producer of the documentary ''Darfur Now''. Schramm is Jewish, and the couple have raised their son in the Jewish faith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In 2013, Ronen helped write and pass the California Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights, which mandates overtime pay.\n\n\nRonen was a legislative aide and chief of staff to Supervisor . As an aide for Campos, she defended his proposals to prohibit the construction of market-rate housing in parts of San Francisco. Campos could not seek reelection to the Board of Supervisors in 2016 due to s. Ronen was elected as his successor in the , defeating Joshua Arce.Joe Rivano Barros, , ''Mission Local'' (November 30, 2016). During the 2016 election campaign, Ronen allied herself with District 1 candidate  and District 11 candidate Kimberly Alvarenga; the trio pledged if elected to jointly push for a  program for 4-year-olds, along other priorities.Lizzie Johnson, John Wildermuth, Joe Garofoli, Rachel Swan, , ''SFGate (September 25, 2016).\n\nRonen was sworn in on January 9, 2017. Her election helped create a female majority on the board for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIn 2020, Ronen ran unopposed for reelection; she received 99.77% of the vote, with the remainder of votes being for s.\n\n\nIn 2022 she authored a Charter Amendment \"Student Success Fund\" which provides $60 million per year in city funds to support a community schools model with the goal of establishing programming in eligible schools to support student academic achievement and social emotional wellness. Funding for the Student Success Fund, while drawn from the San Francisco General Fund, redirects monies from excess Educational Revenue Augmentation Funds that San Francisco receives from the State of California that are intended to fund educational purposes. The Charter Amendment passed the Board of Supervisors with unanimous support, and went onto the 2022 November Ballot as Proposition G. The ballot measure passed with 77.78% of the vote.\n\n\nIn April 2017, Ronen introduced legislation to count children as tenants for purposes of relocation payments under  evictions.\n\nIn 2018, Ronen fought to prevent the construction of a 75-unit building on the site of a laundromat. She argued that an environmental review of the building did not consider the impact of a shadow on a nearby schoolyard, even though an environmental review conducted by officials at the  showed that the new construction, including its shadow, would not have an adverse impact on children at the schoolyard. A few months later, Ronen dropped her opposition, stating that the appeal process seeking to halt the project had been exhausted, thus allowing the project to proceed.\n\nIn 2019, she co-sponsored a resolution opposing , which would have required  to allow  and jobs centers in order to reduce the .\n\nIn 2019, Ronen introduced legislation to close loopholes around tenant buyout laws that have historically become a form of tenant abuse, intimidation, and de facto eviction.\n\nIn October 2021, Ronen voted against the construction of a 495-unit apartment complex (one-quarter of which were designated as affordable housing) on a Nordstrom's  lot next to a BART station. Her vote was unusual, as she was blocking construction of housing in the district of another supervisors. The norm on the board is generally to honor the wishes of the district supervisor, who in this case was , a supporter of the proposed construction. After the vote, ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' editorial board wrote that the Board of Supervisors \"have lost their minds on housing\" and that San Francisco \"needs a Board of Supervisors that won't sabotage any and seemingly all earnest attempts to deal with this city's housing crisis.\" The California Department of Housing and Community Development began an investigation into whether the San Francisco Board of Supervisors acted improperly in its decision to block the housing project. Ronen defended her vote, saying she was \"pro-housing.\"\n\nRonen was an opponent of a proposed market-rate housing development at 1979 Mission Street, which was proposed in 2019 to be built on a block of shuttered retail at a tract next to the . The project, by , was intensely controversial. In 2021, Ronen and Breed introduced legislation to approval a deal in which Crescent Heights would transfer the site to the city to fulfill its affordable housing mandate for a different project (a tower  at South ), and the city would then build 330 low-income housing units on the site. Ronen hailed the agreement as a win for affordable housing.\n\n\nIn 2019, Ronen proposed Mental Health SF legislation along with Supervisor . Mayor  and the Board of Supervisors reached a compromise agreement on the mental health reform effort. The final legislation passed focuses on creating a universal system of mental health services, substance use treatment, and psychiatric medications to San Franciscans who need help. The five key components of Mental Health SF include, the establishment of a Mental Health Service Center, establishment of an Office of Coordinated Care, the establishment of the 24/7 crisis response street team, the expansion of Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment, and the establishment of the Office of Private Health Insurance Accountability.\n\nIn October 2019, Ronen worked with San Francisco City workers to reach a deal to keep the Adult Residential Facility open for people with severe mental illness. In August 2019, the San Francisco Department of Public Health planned on displacing dozens of patients from the Adult Residential Facility, the only City-operated board and care option for people with severe mental illness. Ronen drafted and introduced legislation to ensure that these beds would be used as intended, providing a safe and secure place for people who would otherwise be on the street. In October, Ronen, along with front-line staff, representatives from Local 21 and SEIU 1021, DPH leadership, residents and their families, and the Mayor's office worked together to reach an agreement and pass legislation to ensure the future of the Adult Residential Facility.\n\n\nIn 2020, during the , Ronen was a vocal proponent of cuts to the 's budget. She criticized Mayor 's proposal in 2020 for a 2.6% decrease to the law enforcement budget as a \"slap in the face\" and called for deeper cuts. In October 2022, Ronen repeated calls for cuts to the SFPD (whose budget at the time was up 4.4% from its 2019 levels).Stephanie Sierra, Lindsey Feingold, and John Kelly, ,  (October 13, 2022). \n\nRonen has opposed proposals to fill vacancies within SFPD, or to set minimum SFPD staffing levels, and rejected Police Chief Bill Scott's assessment that there is a understaffing crisis within the department. She has contended that Mayor Breed has given too much focus to police department vacancies at the expenses of vacancies in other city departments, such as the . Ronen has also clashed with Scott after a series of ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reports showed that some SFPD officers ignored crimes in progress or failed to properly investigate them. In a letter to Scott, Ronen wrote that reports of officer apathy \"indicate a systemic breakdown in your department\" and suggested a \"\"; Scott denied that this was the case.\n\nIn March 2023, following a , Ronen demanded more police presence in  within her district. Rosen's reversal prompted critics to accuse her of hypocrisy; in response, Ronen criticized the police department for logging more than 100,000 overtime hours through mid-2023 patrolling  and other shopping areas, rather than other parts of the city.\n\nIn 2023, Ronen apologized for her role in aiding Fernando Madrigal, who was a member of the  gang and simultaneously an activist who promoted reform of the criminal justice and juvenile justice systems. In July 2019, Madrigal fatally shot a 15-year-old bystander with an  while hunting members of rival gangs; before he was implicated in the killing, Ronen appeared with Madrigal at a rally on the steps of , and Ronen wrote a letter to a court supporting Madrigal's petition for early release from his probation for a previous carjacking conviction. After Madrigal was arrested and pleaded guilty to the killing, Ronen tearfully apologized to the victim's mother, saying that she was horrified to discover that Madrigal had murdered the teenager and that she had \"no idea\" of the degree of Madrigal's gang involvement.\n\n\nRonen is married to attorney Francisco Ugarte. They live in the  neighborhood with their daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Doan and her prior company, New Technology Management, had an \"extensive personal and business relationship\" with Fraser. Doan did not have authority to award such a contract on a no-bid basis, and the proposal was called off. Rep.  (D-CA), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, later alleged that Doan \"attempted to go forward with issuing a $20,000 no-bid contract to Fraser even after GSA General Counsel  repeatedly advised that the contract be terminated due to its questionable legality.\"\n Swendiman later transferred to work in the White House Office of Administration.\n\nIn 2007, the '''' reported on several controversies involving Doan. In one, Doan intervened in an effort to determine whether five major contractors should be suspended from doing business with the federal government for failing to turn over rebates on travel on government contracts. In another, Doan proposed to curb the agency's contract audits and to cut the inspector general's budget by $5 million. The inspector general had reported that the audits, which aim to ensure that the government is getting the best prices for goods and services, had saved taxpayers more than $1 billion over the previous two years.

Sun Microsystems announced the end of its long-standing contract with the federal government in mid-September 2007. However, the week before Sun announced its decision, Doan alerted Congress to factors that may provide disincentives for companies to do work with the federal government. Doan expressed her concerns in a September 7, 2007, letter to Sen.

His brother Michael,  in 's 1968 Assembly race, again ran a targeted mail operation.\n\n\nIn 1974, Berman and Waxman both opposed 's unsuccessful revolt against  , who rewarded Berman's loyalty by appointing him the youngest  in Assembly history. McCarthy fired Berman when Berman tried to replace him in 1980. Although McCarthy failed to retain the speakership, Berman failed to win it and Brown became speaker. Other members remarked on what a tough politician he was; the Bermans helped arrange a  defeat for at least one colleague () who had opposed his bid.\n\n\nHe also served as Chairman of the Assembly Democratic Caucus and on the Policy Research Management Committee of the Assembly.\n\n\n\n\nAfter redistricting made the 26th district significantly more Democratic, incumbent Republican Congressman  decided to run in  in 1982. Berman won the Democratic primary for the open seat with 83% of the vote, and the general election with 60% of the vote.\n\n\nBerman was reelected 14 times, never dropping below 61% of the vote, from 1984 through 2010.\n\nThe  allocated California one new House seat, 53 in all. Berman, \"dad of the delegation\" on redistricting, made a deal with Republicans  and  to keep 34 safe seats for Democrats, add one new Republican district, and protect nineteen incumbent Republicans. Many California Democrats in the House and  hired Michael Berman, Howard Berman's brother, as a redistricting consultant, for a fee of $20,000 each. When the August 2001 plan was unveiled, Congressman , a fellow Democrat from California, complained that it undermined the safety of his seat with too many  voters, saying, \"Howard Berman stabbed me in the back.\" Berman agreed to redraw the boundary between their districts, giving himself 56% and Sherman 37%  population. The redistricting plan survived a court challenge from the , which argued that the redistricting diluted Hispanic representation. The Republicans suffered some slippage; they had only 19 members in the  to the .\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, Berman paid his brother Michael Berman's consulting firm Berman & D'Agostino $195,000 from campaign funds. In the 2002 campaign, Berman & D'Agostino was paid $75,000 in political consulting fees. In 2005, $50,000 in consulting fees were paid to the company, and Michael Berman himself was paid a further $80,500 in campaign management and consulting fees. In 2006, $70,000 was paid in consulting fees.\n\n\n\nFollowing redistricting, Berman decided to run in the newly redrawn , facing fellow Democrat . Sherman had the advantage because he previously represented over half of the district. About 60% of voters of the new  resided in Sherman's former district, while just 20% of voters resided in Berman's.\n\nThe race, unprecedented in pitting two very similar candidates of the same party against each other in the general election, was called a \"slugfest\". Berman received the endorsements from about two-thirds of California's Democratic congressional delegation. Among Sherman's endorsements were then-  of California, then-  of California, former President , and Congressman  of Michigan.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, Sherman ranked first in the seven-candidate open primary, with 42% of the vote. Berman ranked second, with 26% of the vote. The state's top-two primary system, implemented in 2010, allows for two candidates of the same party to face-off in the general election. Berman ran as the more conservative Democrat, hoping to divide the Democratic vote and dominate in the independent and conservative vote. However, in the November general election, .\n\n\nBerman has been described as \"one of the most creative members of the House, and one of the most clear-sighted operators in American politics\". He has been an active legislator on several issues, but has also been described as \"not one who gets much publicity\".\n\nBerman was the House sponsor of the 1986  that authorized  by . It led to recoveries for the United States Government exceeding $1 billion dollars.\n\nBerman has championed protecting American film industry jobs from  (\"\").

Berman voted in support of the invasion of  in both  and , as well as for the , positions that have hurt his standing among many liberals in his district. While he generally supports  - for instance, voting in favor of the  (NAFTA) and various trade agreements with specific countries -, he voted against the more recent  (CAFTA). He opposes withdrawing U.S. support for the . In that same year, he also voted to phase out many  programs put into place by the administration of President  as part of the \"\".\n\nIn Congress, Berman led the investigation into the conduct of House members in the .\n\nIn May 2012, Berman co-sponsored a bill with Republican Congressman  of California to reinstate tax credits given to films produced mainly in the United States. The credits were active from 2008 until 2011, and were aimed at keeping films in . Berman stressed that we \"must make every effort to keep American productions here in the United States\".\n\n\nBerman is known for his protection of  interests, and his alliances with the entertainment industry; he was sometimes referred to as the \"representative from \". The major industry contributing to his election campaigns has been the entertainment industry. He proposed legislation under which copyright holders would be able to employ technological tools such as file blocking, , , and decoysamong othersto curb piracy (Peer to Peer Piracy Prevention Act). He has been named as one of the primary politicians involved in the creation of the  (SOPA) and the  (ACTA). In a September 2008 hearing of the House  Subcommittee, Berman criticized the 's policy requiring NIH-sponsored research to be submitted to a database open to the public by saying that \"the N in NIH shouldn't stand for .\"\n\n\nAccording to '''', \"Berman played a key and under-appreciated role in securing passage of a resolution that gave President  broad authority to use force\". The ''National Journal'' reports that Berman, \"played a critical role in winning passage, by a wide margin, of the Iraq War resolution in October 2002. He strongly supported military action against Iraq, and in September, he organized a group of Democrats who shared his views. Berman's discussions led to House Democratic   agreement with the administration on the terms of the resolutiontalks that undercut the demands of other senior Democrats, including then House Democratic   and  Chairman . In June 2006, Berman voted for the Republican resolution to reject a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq.\"\n\n\nBerman is also a supporter of , telling the Jewish newspaper, '''', after being appointed Chairman of the , \"Even before I was a Democrat, I was a .\" He has sponsored the Anti-Boycott Act in the House, which prohibits American individuals and organizations from actively boycotting i goods.\n\n\nIn 2003, Berman expressed his concerns over the Patriot Act with then- , specifically on the method to hold illegal immigrants until they prove they are not terrorists.\n\nIn 2000, Berman, along with then-Senator  of , proposed an amnesty, which would have granted legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented farm laborers. In exchange, requirements that growers provide housing to guest workers, and pay them a minimum wage adjusted annually for inflation, would have been relaxed. In 2005, Berman was part of the bi-partisan group in Congress that fought for immigration reform efforts.

A member of the , she is the first woman and the first  to hold the position.\n\n\nElliott received her undergraduate degree from the , majoring in English and Philosophy. She then received her  degree from the .\n\n\n\n\nElliott was one of four Democrats to run for city attorney. The incumbent city attorney , her former boss, could no longer run after 8 years in the position due to term limits. Unlike her opponents, Elliott did not receive many of the typical endorsements from the various local democratic groups. Her second-place victory in the June primary was considered an upset due to her opponents out raising and out spending her. In the November runoff, she defeated Robert Hickey, a Republican, by a margin of 57 to 42.\n\nElliott said she hoped to make the position less politicized, and take on a role as legal counsel for the San Diego City Council and mayor as opposed to being a public figure.\n\n\nIn the 2020 election, Elliott ran for re-election for San Diego City Attorney in California against attorney Cory Briggs. Elliott won in the general election on November 3, 2020, receiving over 66% of the votes.\n\n\nWhile running for city attorney in 2016, Elliott opposed Measure C and Measure D, which would have built a Chargers football stadium using hotel taxes. She stated the taxes would divert money from city services.\n\n\nElliott challenges Trump's travel ban.\n\n\nElliott successfully compelled the City Council to sign amicus briefs which show support for gay rights and transgender students in cases before the Supreme Court.\n\n\nElliott was asked by councilman David Alvarez about the extent of power by a San Diego mayor to change the city budget. Mayor Faulconer tried to earmark an extra $5 million in the city budget to fund a special election to expand the  and re-purpose . When his addition was not included in the year's budget by the city council, Faulconer tried to veto their budget and force his changes through with a simple 50% majority. When asked for clarification whether Faulconer would actually need a supermajority of 6 votes to add new items to the budget, Elliott stated that the City Charter gives the mayor power over the budget to \"either approve, veto, or modify any line item approved by the Council.\" Therefore, in her opinion, Faulconer's actions were legal until the City Charter was changed to say otherwise.\n\n\nA state audit found that San Diego only tests about half of the rape kits it collects. While other cities identified in the audit have started testing all rape kits, San Diego is the only city that has not changed its policy. Elliot has repeatedly stated that she believes San Diego should test 100% of rape kits. She has said, \"The experience in other jurisdictions shows that the evidence in untested kits can prove valuable in solving cold cases and identifying serial rapists. That alone is good reason.\"\n\n\nIndependent groups in San Diego were in charge of running local recreational programs for 4 decades leading up to 2017. In 2017, there were revelations that money was being spent unevenly by the independent councils. For example, Carmel Valley began 2017 with more than $400,000 available for recreational services, while Stockton's account had $51. The independent councils also weren't following city rules about spending tax money. Elliot issued a legal opinion that tax money must be controlled by the city and could not be used to run non-regulated independent groups.\n\n\nElliott issued a statement that short-term rentals are currently illegal in San Diego. She said there are no laws or legal definitions in the San Diego city code regarding short-term rentals, and her legal opinion is that the city considers new housing activity illegal until it is defined in the city code. She has said she hoped this statement would spur the city to take action one way or the other. However, no action by the city or  has yet been taken to either legalize or restrict short-term rentals in the city code.\n\n\n* Voice of the Year 2017 – The nonprofit news organization  named Elliott Voice of the Year in 2017 for driving the year's biggest civic discussions\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n City of San Diego Official Website|url=https://www.sandiego.gov/city-clerk/elections/city/160607primary|website=www.sandiego.gov}}\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A member of the , who has represented  of the  since 2015.\n\n\nMarqueece Harris-Dawson grew up in  and was raised in the Black church. He graduated from  where he majored in Political Science and Mathematics. He holds a certificate in Nonprofit Management from 's Graduate School of Business and is also an  Pahara Fellow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris-Dawson joined the Community Coalition in 1995, recognized as one of the most progressive non-profits in the country. In 2004 he succeeded U.S. Congresswoman  as President and CEO of the organization and influenced the community through several key pieces of legislation.\n\nIn 2006, the Community Coalition advocated for foster care funding in the state budget, securing $82 million to improve the foster care system and $36 million for . The organization also established the Ex-Offender Task Force to advocate for the removal of the lifetime ban on drug felons' access to public assistance. They collaborated with Assemblymember  to craft a bill to remove these bans, which was signed by  in 2005.\n\nThe Community Coalition analyzed the distribution of tax bonds and found it was unevenly distributed. In 1997, Proposition BB allocated additional funds to  schools. Through youth organizing, they secured an additional $153 million to address priority repairs in overcrowded schools.\n\nIn 2000, the Community Coalition’s youth organization launched a campaign to advocate for access to A-G college preparatory classes in all LAUSD schools. In 2005, the LAUSD Board of Education passed the historic A-G Resolution, mandating that A-G college preparatory curriculum be made available in all LAUSD schools starting in 2008. In 2000, the Community Coalition’s youth organization launched a campaign to advocate for access to A-G college preparatory classes in all LAUSD schools.[6] In 2005, the LAUSD Board of Education passed the historic A-G Resolution, mandating that A-G college preparatory curriculum be made available in all LAUSD schools starting in 2008.[6] This policy change provided students in South LA with a pathway toward college, addressing the inequities in education that had previously made this nearly impossible.\n\nAdditionally, the Community Coalition played a major role in the School Climate Bill of Rights, which reformed LAUSD suspension policies and led to the beginning of restorative justice policies in public schools.\n\n\nIn 2015, Harris-Dawson was elected to represent the Eighth District of Los Angeles, an area home to over 248,000 people, including a significant population of African-American and Latino households. He was elected by 62% of the vote in 2015, ran unopposed in his 2020 campaign, and won by 78% against two other candidates in 2024.\n\nIn response to the 2020 , Harris-Dawson supported a reallocation of LAPD funding for community-led public safety investments. For the first time in LA’s history, $150 million was reallocated from the LAPD budget towards public programming. $4.2 million was allocated to Council District Eight for the office to support 57 South LA organizations through community grants. Harris-Dawson also introduced two  policies one exploring an unarmed crisis response program diverting responses from LAPD to mental health professionals and another to develop an unarmed traffic enforcement program in Los Angeles.\n\n\nWithin his first 18 months as a Councilmember, Harris-Dawson authored Proposition HHH, a $1.2 billion bond for permanent supportive housing, marking the largest investment toward ending homelessness in the nation.\n\nHarris-Dawson has introduced various policies to combat homelessness, create quality jobs, clean streets, and encourage community policing. He has leveraged $1.7 billion in federal, state, and Metro funding to address disinvestment and revitalize streetscapes in South LA.\n\nPublic safety reform has also been a key initiative of his administration. Following the 2020 George Floyd uprisings, Harris-Dawson co-introduced several legislative efforts calling for police reform, including policies for Unarmed Crisis Response and Unarmed Traffic Enforcement.\n\n\nHarris-Dawson co-authored Proposition HHH, which aims to address homelessness, and led efforts for a Community Safety Partnership between the community and the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nDuring the 2020 pandemic, he created the Senior Meals Program to support the local business community while assuring the most vulnerable population in the district, seniors, were provided with regular meal delivery. During this program 2,200 seniors were fed with a total of 56,785 meals distributed. This program partnered with 32 South LA businesses and provided them with income during the COVID-19 lockdown. The program was a model for the citywide emergency senior meals program, and later, the State of CA. \n\n\n\nWhen the Metro train connector to LAX was planned to go above ground, potentially dividing the Crenshaw Corridor, Harris-Dawson saw it as an economic opportunity and a place-keeping strategy. Where the Metro would go above ground he envisioned the first enclave dedicated to the African-American experience in Los Angeles, similar to other cultural districts in the city. This initiative led to the construction of Destination Crenshaw, a 1.3-mile public art museum along the boulevard, featuring notable Los Angeles artists and muralists, to narrate the African American experience in Los Angeles.\n\n\nCouncilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson has been a pivotal figure in promoting the Community Safety Partnership (CSP), an initiative aimed at enhancing public safety through a collaborative approach involving community members and law enforcement. Initially launched as a pilot program to address a public safety crisis at a neighborhood recreation center, CSP has evolved into a permanent fixture for the LAPD and the City of Los Angeles. On September 17, 2022 the Harvard Park Community Safety Advisory Council celebrated five years of CSP at Jackie Tatum Harvard Park, highlighting the program's achievements and challenges.\n\nCSP integrates gang interventionists and preventionists via the Mayor’s Office of Gang Reduction and Youth Development (GRYD), offering comprehensive programs targeting all community members, from youth to seniors. This inclusive approach has significantly transformed the neighborhood's atmosphere, eliminating homicides and reducing violent crime by nearly 50% over five years.\n\nInitially launched as a pilot program to address a public safety crisis at a neighborhood recreation center, CSP has evolved into a permanent fixture for the LAPD and the City of Los Angeles. Harris-Dawson’s leadership has been crucial in expanding the program's reach and efficacy, with a particular focus on building relationships and strengthening community ties through relationship-based policing.\n\nThe program has been lauded for its success in reducing crime and improving community-police relations. However, it has also faced criticism. Activists, including those from Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, argue that expanding CSP effectively redirects funds back to the police, rather than investing in alternative community-based services that might address social issues more effectively. Critics claim that while CSP aims to foster trust, many residents still harbor deep mistrust of the police and are concerned about potential mistreatment.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Harris-Dawson remains committed to CSP as part of a broader strategy to reform public safety. He has advocated for leveraging significant federal, state, and local funding to revitalize South LA, addressing disinvestment, and supporting crime prevention through robust partnerships with law enforcement, community organizations, and social service providers. This approach aims to create safe, thriving neighborhoods and enhance public safety, civic participation, and community development in areas like Harvard Park.\n\n\nIn response to the , then-Councilmember Harris-Dawson introduced and seconded various motions calling for Nury Martinez's removal from the position of council president, the removal of all three council members from their committees, and their censure.  He also introduced a motion calling for a charter amendment to strengthen the outcomes of a council censure.\n\nAdditionally, he has advocated for an independent redistricting commission by opening up the charter for full reform. The support of an independent redistricting commission will be on the November 2024 ballot.\n\n\n after taking his oath of office in 2015.]]\n\nIn 2023, the sitting council president pro tempore stepped down from their position due to an embezzlement investigation. The council nominated and unanimously elected Harris-Dawson to fill the position.\n\nIn June 2024, Harris-Dawson was unanimously elected, 14-0, to serve as Council President beginning September 20th, 2024.\n\n\nCouncilmember Harris-Dawson has received numerous awards, including:\n\n* Do Something \"BRICK\" Award\n* The Wellness Foundation Sabbatical Award\n* NAACP Man of Valor Award\n* Durfee Foundation's Stanton Fellowship\n* Liberty Hill Foundation's Upton Sinclair Award\n* InnerCity Struggle Esteban E. Torres Award\n* The YMCA Community Champion Award\n\nHe also served as a board member for the Liberty Hill Foundation.\n\n\nHarris-Dawson resides in South Los Angeles with his wife, Karrie. Aside from his work in the nonprofit and public sectors he has an avid interest in history and music. Harris-Dawson is also a longtime vegetarian.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n\n\n|-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In June 2008, he urged voters to approve Proposition 8, saying \"This is an opportunity to take back a little bit of dignity ... for kids, for all of us in California.

Judge lifts ban on seizing assets - A group challenging the state's taking of unclaimed property plans to appeal. ''Sacramento Bee'', October 20, 2007. Because a ban could cause the State to lose $300 million per year in revenue, Chiang took steps to improve the notification of people whose assets were about to be seized, including sending them notices, and to improve the ability of people to recover their assets once seized.

While Ammiano lost that second election in December, Ammiano's campaign galvanized more radical voters in San Francisco, and had a major impact on the composition of the new, more liberal Board of Supervisors the next year. There is a documentary about the 1999 mayoral election, titled ''See How They Run''.\n\n\n\n\nAmmiano introduced , to the . The bill, introduced by Ammiano in February 2009, calling for the  statewide and provided for regulation of marijuana like alcohol, with people over 21 years old allowed to grow, buy, sell and possess cannabis. With the state's severe budget shortfalls the bill was discussed in light of revenue generation as well as savings from decriminalizing and prosecuting marijuana-focused possession crimes. The bill failed the assembly's Public Safety committee by a 3–4 vote on January 12, 2010.\n\nAmmiano introduced a bill in a subsequent Assembly to create a new statewide entity within the  to regulate and license  in California, arguing that a patchwork of local regulations had led to the proliferation of both \"legitimate and illegitimate operations\" in the state. , ''Sacramento Bee'' (May 29, 2014).

When former San Francisco Mayor  introduced the governor, Ammiano shouted \"You lie!\" in a copy-cat of Representative 's remarks during President 's congressional address a month earlier. Ammiano walked out yelling that Schwarzenegger could \"kiss my gay ass\". In a video of the event, an audience member is heard yelling \"Kiss my '''' ass!\" at Schwarzenegger, leading some to conclude that \"faggot\" was what Ammiano actually said, and that \"gay ass\" was a censored version of the quote. However, Ammiano did not use the word \"faggot\", and the person yelling \"kiss my faggot ass\" was someone else.\n\nFour days after the fundraiser, Schwarzenegger vetoed Assembly Bill 1176, which was authored by Ammiano to help the port of San Francisco with financing issues, and had cleared the State Senate 40–0 and the Assembly 78–0. Schwarzenegger sent a  to the  explaining the veto. The letter contained a hidden message that, when using the first letter of each line along the left margin, spelled out 'fuck you'. Governor Schwarzenegger denied the hidden message was inserted intentionally, but media outlets consulted a mathematics professor, who reportedly determined that the odds that it was simply a coincidence were astronomical.\n\nOn an October 30, 2019, appearance on '''', Schwarzenegger admitted that he had intentionally added the message and later lied about not knowing the message was in the memo.\n\n\nAmmiano's  of many years was Tim Curbo, a fellow schoolteacher.

Price was a , representing the state's  which he won in the  to fill the seat vacated by . He previously served as a member of the , representing the state's . He was first elected to that position in 2006, and was re-elected in 2008. Price resigned as state senator on July 1, 2013, to be sworn in as Los Angeles city councilman.\n\nPrice's tenure as District 9 Councilman has been marked by accusations of  and  investigations. On June 13, 2023, Price was charged with ten criminal counts relating to corruption; including five counts of embezzlement of government funds, three counts of perjury, and two counts of conflict of interest.\n\n\nFrom 1993 to 1997, Price was a member of the  , representing the city's District 1. In 1997, he was defeated in a bid to become the mayor of Inglewood.  In 2001, he reclaimed his former city council seat and held it until his election to the state assembly in 2006.  As a council member, he was the chair of the City Council Community Economic Development Committee.\n\nIn addition to his council responsibilities, Price served on the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance and the 's South Bay Governance Council.  For several years, he also served as a consultant with the -sponsored Small Business Development Center.\n\nPrice was first elected to the California State Assembly in 2006 to represent the 51st District, and was re-elected to a second term in 2008.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Curren Price was investigated due to allegations that he was willingly engaging in illegal  which as an offense be punishable as either a misdeamenor or felony in California.\nQuestions of Price's marriages first arose when news outlets reported that while he is currently married to Del Richardson, his divorce from a previous marriage to Lynn Suzette Green had never been finalized. In 2012, Curren Price claimed in court that he was unable to locate Green, and thus had difficulty in going through with the divorce proceedings. Price and his divorce attorney Albert Robles claimed in a document that they could not locate Lynn Price for the purpose of serving her with divorce papers and instead allow them to serve notice by buying a public notice ad in a local newspaper.  Curren Price and Robles claimed that Lynn Price's most recent address was a property that was subsequently reported to belong to his second wife, Del Richardson-Price. News of Del Richardson-Price's ownership of his first wife's residence raised allegations that Curren Price was attempting to divorce his wife without her knowledge.\n\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that the Los Angeles District Attorney was reviewing a 2003 ordinance that would provide lifetime medical benefits for retired Inglewood elected officials. In 2003, as a member of the Inglewood City Council, Curren Price voted in favor of an ordinance. The ordinance came under scrutiny as Inglewood Treasurer Wanda Brown publicly accused the City Council and City Manager Artie Fields of misappropriating $195,983 for medical benefits for past elected officials. While Price himself was not the recipient of any medical benefits under the ordinance, his wife Del Richardson-Price filed a claim in January 2018 for medical claims to be paid on her behalf. The claim was denied.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Curren Price supported plans for Reef, a $1.2-billion skyscraper complex, that would be built in his  district. Critics argued the development would fuel , could provide a hazard to drivers, and the proposed  could shine into the homes of the lower income South Los Angeles community. Despite opposition from city planning commissioners, tenants rights activists, and local residents, Los Angeles City Council approved plans for Reef. Subsequently, a  co-sponsored by the lobbying firm representing Reef paid for campaign mailers, outdoor signs, and  to voters from former Mayor . Altogether, companies tied to the Reef developer donated $75,000 to Curren Price's re-election campaign. Curren Price denied to comment on allegations that he accepted  in return for pushing the project through.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that Price married Del Richardson before his divorce to his previous wife was finalized. Price failed to disclose his first wife's assets as well as his new wife's assets in his reports. \"Since some of Price's properties are located in the City of Los Angeles, he was supposed to disclose ownership in the event they were impacted by City Council votes on issues such as sidewalk repair, street lighting, street furniture, advertising and redistricting, among others. Price also failed to disclose the businesses owned by second wife Del Richardson-Price including DRA Associates, Just Work Inc. and Cuba Travel Service. If they, or their affiliates, applied for contracts from the LA City Council, Price would have had to recuse himself from those discussions and votes. Councilmember Price also neglected in 2012 to list any of Del Richardson-Price's clients who paid her more than $10,000 each. A year later, in 2013, at least 20 businesses and government agencies fit that description Price either failed to detail his wife's client-based income in 2012, or she went from zero-to-20 clients as soon as he was elected to LA City Council.\"\n\nIn 2019, Price was scrutinized over several instances in which he voted on matters benefiting wife's consulting company Del Richardson & Associates. Price voted on decisions involving at least 10 companies in the same years they were listed as providing at least $10,000 in income to Del Richardson & Associates, according to his annual financial disclosures and council records.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the '''' reported that Price was amongst a group of Los Angeles Councilmembers being investigated in a  probe. The probe was primarily concerned with Chinese investors bankrolling projects in the Los Angeles area. The FBI warrant was in search of possible bribery, extortion, money laundering and other crimes as part of a corruption investigation at City Hall. Price heads a council committee focused on economic development, which reviews taxpayer subsidies offered by the city to hotel developers in and around downtown. In November 2020, when indictments were unsealed against , no evidence of corruption was presented against Price but five new names were added to the corruption scandal, including former Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan, Wei Huang of San Marino, Shen Zhen New World 1, LLC a company owned and controlled by Huang, Dae (David) Lee of Bel Air and 940 Hill, LLC which is owned by Lee.\n\n\nOn June 30, 2021, an LAPD bomb disposal squad detonated confiscated illegal fireworks in a residential neighborhood in Curren Price's 9th District, injuring 17 people, causing extensive damage to 22 residences, 13 businesses, and 37 vehicles. As a result of the explosion, more than 80 residents in the neighborhood were displaced and relocated to hotels that would serve as temporary housing while their homes would be repaired. In February 2023, nineteen months after the explosion, it was reported many residents were still displaced and living in the hotels due to delays caused by what they claimed to be negligence from Los Angeles city officials and unresponsive insurance companies. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Price was among city officials hoping to evict victims from the hotels and accused victims of \"gaming the system\" and commented, \"They've had it good living in the hotel rent free for several months. They want that to last as long as it can.\" Following widespread criticism, Price later issued an apology and vowed to secure additional funding for victims to stay at the hotel beyond the initial deadline. In a statement, Price was quoted as saying that \"the city of L.A. will not abandon them, and rest assured they will not be subjected to any type of eviction that can cause further pain and trauma.\"\n\n\n\nIn June 2023, Price was charged with five counts of embezzlement of government funds, three counts of perjury and two counts of conflict of interest. The district attorney's office alleges that Price took part in  schemes that benefited his wife's company, which Price failed to list on government financial disclosure forms.\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He has owned a financial advisory and wealth management practice, the Wealth Strategies Group, since 2001.\n\n\nIn 2012, Allen began his political career by running for California State Assembly's 72nd district. The seat was open due to term limits. He finished second in the June primary with 19.9% of the vote, trailing establishment Republican frontrunner  City Councilman Troy Edgar, who won 28% of the vote. In the general election Allen surpassed Edgar by an 11.4% margin. Under recently passed  this was the first California election to take place under a , in which the top two candidates advanced to the general election, regardless of party preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen unsuccessfully ran for  in the .

He proposed redacting recently implemented laws (, , and ). He states they are responsible for an uptick in violent crime rates in California. However, there has not been an uptick in violent crime, and in fact it has been decreasing. The nonpartisan  found crime to be at a historic low.\n\nAllen used his efforts to repeal the SB 1 gas tax increase and his opposition to illegal immigration as key stances in his campaign. He also supports more \"tough-on-crime\" policing measures and additional water support for Central California Valley farmers.\n\nOn May 1, 2018, Allen spoke at a California Republican primary forum in . Allen delivered his opening speech, stating that he wants to undo recent voter-enacted soft on crime laws and promised to \"get rid of the state-mandated Common Core [educational curriculum].\"\n\nDuring his campaigning for California governor and subsequently, Allen has repeatedly made many disputed statements to the public and media. He has been criticized by pundits and  sites for these claims. He has made claims on the Oroville Dam regarding water capturing measures he wants to implement if elected, about high crime rates in California, and about the so-called \"sanctuary laws\" in California. In 2018, Allen made the claim that a new bill in California would \"literally\" \"ban the sale of the Bible\", a claim he has repeated despite having been fact-checked by several media outlets. He has also made the claim multiple times that California legalized child prostitution.\n\nWhile campaigning he made the promise that if he gets elected governor that \"every Californian will have a green lawn and take long showers.\"\n\nAllen was criticized for missing several days of work at the California State Assembly while he was out campaigning.\n\nAfter losing in the primary elections, Allen didn't immediately endorse his Republican rival , but eventually decided to do so in July 2018. He also said that he wants his supporters to \"stand up and fight\" to \"take back California\". He started the .\n\n\nMidway through his campaign for California Governor, in 2017 Allen raised $447,236 for his campaign and had expenditures of $654,602 during that time according to an official campaign filing. After Allen lost the Primary, his most recent campaign finance records showed $37,539 cash on hand and $17,866 in unpaid bills.

Neither candidate was able to reach the 60% threshold set by the California Republican Party for an official endorsement. In a Berkeley IGS Poll from December 2017, it showed Allen tied at 9 percent with Republican John Cox.\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2018, Travis was accused of several sexual harassment allegations during this time as a state assemblyman, a claim which he vehemently denied as being politically motivated, stating “I’m sure I’ve shaken many people’s hands, tapped many people on the shoulder, and have even tapped people’s feet accidentally. But there has never been anything in any of my actions that has been inappropriate, and nor will there ever be.” On November 15, 2018, Allen announced his candidacy for the chairmanship of the . \"For too long, the California Republican establishment has told us that we must look more like Democrats in order to be elected in the state of California,\" Allen said, adding that \"This sort of backwards thinking has lost seats and races across the state to where, today, the Republican party is at the lowest point it's been since the 1880s.\" He lost to Jessica Milan Patterson, who became the state party's first female leader.\n\n\n\nAllen has described himself as pro-life. He received a 0% score from  Affiliates of California in 2013, 2015, and 2017.\n\nIn 2014 Allen received a 55% score from Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. On this scorecard he was ranked positively for his support of AB 1755 (which mandated a 15-day limit to notify the  of a breach of patient data), AB 1841 (which expanded the definition of “technical supportive services” who are allowed to handle medication), AB 2051 (which streamlined the Medi-Cal enrollment process), and SB857 (an omnibus health bill). Allen opposed SB 1053 (contraceptives and health care coverage) and SB 1094 (sale of assets in non-profit health care facilities).\n\nIn 2016 Allen received a 67% score from Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. He was scored positively for voting yes on AB 1561, a bill which proposed to \"exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale in this state of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, tampons, sanitary napkins, menstrual sponges, and menstrual cups\"; and SB 999, a bill intended to require that health insurance companies \"cover up to a 12-month supply of FDA-approved, self-administered hormonal contraceptives\".\n\n\n\"The only major-party candidate to support the death penalty is Assemblyman Travis Allen, R-Huntington Beach (Orange County), who said it was 'absolutely necessary in cases where heinous crimes have been committed.' He said he would deny commutation to any condemned inmate who had been 'rightfully convicted and sentenced'.\" He is also critical of the high yearly cost associated with preserving the lives of over 700 people who are on death row in California prisons.\n\n\nAllen has stated that he opposes mandatory full-day kindergarten, because he believes that children are being indoctrinated by \"liberal curriculum\". Allen wants to end Common Core's application at the state level, instead allowing local districts to set their own curricula.\n\n\nAllen has called  and sea-level rise \"unsettled,\" “absolute nonsense,” and “bogus science\". He states, \"These policy prescriptions of the Democrats of more regulation and higher taxes that they try to justify with tenuous climate change \"science\" are not benefiting Californians, nor are they benefiting the environment.\" Allen has stated that he opposes the  (CEQA) of 1970 because it \"strangles new housing development\".\n\nIn 2017 the  scored Allen at 6% for his voting record on similar bills. His only vote aligned with this organization's goals was for a bill to do with disclosure of ingredients in cleaning products. In the same year, Allen was rated 25% by the California Environmental Justice Alliance, and 25% by the  of California.\n\n\nAllen sponsored a proposed 2018 ballot initiative to repeal Senate Bill 1, legislation enacted by the Democratic-controlled legislature which increased the state gas tax by 12 cents a gallon and the diesel tax by 20 cents, and “as much as $175 more in annual car registration fees.”  Although this initiative did not qualify for the ballot, another initiative to repeal the gas tax increase and to require voter approval of future gas and vehicle taxes did qualify for the ballot as Proposition 6.\n\nAccording to , some of Allen's statements about the gas tax have been incorrect and problematic, which he disputes. According to Allen, the tax (SB1) allocates money to \"transportation-related projects\", which he considers to be a vague description of where the funding could be spent and makes the point repeatedly during many of his public appearances. He alleges that the money will be spent on Democratic \"budgetary mistakes\".\n\nPolitiFact does agree with Allen's point that “the congested corridor program cannot fund general purpose freeway lanes, which are the main lanes used by most drivers,” because “the legislation does, in fact, prohibit spending this money on those.” However, Politifact gave Allen a “mostly false” rating because he “distorted the purpose of the tax,” which is to reduce “vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse gases, and air pollution,\" and to “reduce people's dependency on their cars.”\n\n\nIn 2015, the Firearms Policy Coalition gave Allen an \"A\" rating in recognition of his support for Second Amendment rights. In 2014 Allen received an \"A-\" grade score from the , followed by a 93% score in 2016. and an A from the Gun Owners of California (a branch of ). In 2018, the Gun Owners of California again awarded Allen an A.\n\nAllen authored a failed bill which would have changed California into a  state.\n\n\nAllen opposed the proposed Medicare expansion and child vaccination policy under . He has stated opposition to  noting its high cost and crippling effect on the state budget. Allen's solution includes introducing competition into the California healthcare market, “The solution is to open our markets to companies across the United States to compete for Californians’ business.” He also noted the need to increase the allowances on Health Savings Accounts.\n\n\nAllen voted no on  (2017) when it came to the California State Assembly for a floor vote on September 15, 2017. He has vocally opposed the \"Sanctuary State\" bill speaking out against it publicly for the first time on February 1, 2017, on the  show on  AM 640. SB 54 passed the Senate and Assembly and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on October 5, 2017, with an effective date of January 1, 2018.\n\nAllen continued his opposition to SB 54 and, as he called it, the \"illegal sanctuary state\" on January 2, 2018, when he appeared on the  show,  where he invited President Donald Trump and United States Attorney General  to sue Sacramento over the new \"Sanctuary State\" law. He would appear several more times on Fox News and other networks repeating this invitation throughout 2018.\n\nAllen made this a cornerstone of his failed 2018 campaign for California Governor, vowing \"to reverse the illegal sanctuary state in [his] first 100 days in office.\"\n\nAllen has disputed statements about the details of the bill and about support for it. His assertions regarding public support for the sanctuary state are based on various polls, Polls come from different focus groups, conservative vs. liberal although this has been a point of debate as well.\n\n\nIn 2016, Allen introduced legislation in opposition to the  (BDS) campaign - AB 1552: a bill that would prohibit state government entities from doing business with companies that officially join the BDS campaign, and AB 1551, another bill that would forbid state government entities from investing in companies engaged in political actions to damage or limit commerce with Israel and Israeli companies. Allen's AB 1552 was eventually signed into law as AB 2844, of which Allen was principal author.\n\n\nIn the State Assembly, Allen earned 100% ratings from the , the  and the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. Allen's support for lower taxes and opposition to tax increases earned him A+ ratings from the .\n\n\nAllen is a supporter of , specifically in California, and has made this a part of his platform for his race for governor in California.\n\nHe has stated publicly and via his social media accounts, that there is voter fraud in California. His \"controversial\" statement was, “Eleven counties in California have more total registered voters than citizens over the age of 18. How is this possible?” In the opinion of some newspaper editorialists, a statement which never had any evidence for and which has been proven incorrect. He \"made up\" inaccurate numbers for the number of registered voters in California, according to newspaper opinion writer, Dan Morain.\n\nIn August 2017,  on behalf of the (Election Integrity Project California, Inc.) sent a notice-of-violation letter to the state of California alleging that public records obtained on the Election Assistance Commission's 2016 Election Administration Voting Survey and through verbal accounts from various county agencies show eleven California counties - Imperial (102%), Lassen (102%), Los Angeles (112%), Monterey (104%), San Diego (138%), San Francisco (114%), San Mateo (111%), Santa Cruz (109%), Solano (111%), Stanislaus (102%), and Yolo (110%) - have more registered voters than voting-age citizens; and that Los Angeles County officials “informed us that the total number of registered voters now stands at a number that is a whopping 144% of the total number of resident citizens of voting age.” In December 2017 Judicial Watch filed a federal lawsuit against Los Angeles County and the State of California over their alleged failure to clean their voter rolls and to produce election-related records as required by the federal National Voter Registration Act (NVRA)().\n\n\nAllen is divorced and single.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In a 2013 interview, Rohrabacher asserted that he and Putin later became close friends.\n\nAccording to , Prince, as an intern on Rohrabacher's staff, travelled around the world on fact finding missions to support Rohrabacher's interests.\n\nRohrabacher called the Russian banker , a Putin ally, \"sort of the ' favorite Russian\".\n\nOn September 8, 2008, at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, Rohrabacher argued that the Georgians had initiated a recent military confrontation in the ongoing .\n\nIn 2012, the  warned Rohrabacher that his support for Russia's interests was allowing Russia to cultivate him for its purposes.\n\nIn February 2013, Rohrabacher gave a speech urging the right to self-determination for the  in  at an  conference in London.\n\nIn April 2014, he  that \"If majority of people legally residing in Alaska want to be part of Russia then it's OK with me.\" \n\nIn April 2016, Rohrabacher and a member of his staff, Paul Behrends, traveled to Russia and returned with 's confidential talking points memo about incriminating information on Democratic donors. The talking points paper used at the  on June 9, 2016 by  was very similar to the document Rohrabacher had obtained from Chaika in April.\n\nRohrabacher is known for his longtime friendship with Putin and for his defense of \"the Russian point of view\". On June 15, 2016, then-House Majority Leader  told a group of Republicans, \"'There's two people I think  pays: Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God'\". Then-House Speaker  ended the conversation by saying \"'No leaks. This is how we know we're a real family here'\". The Republicans present were sworn to secrecy. Brendan Buck, counselor to , initially denied these reports, but was then told that '''' had a recording. After the recording was leaked by the ''Post'' in May 2017, McCarthy said the comment was intended as a joke.\n\nAround that time, Rohrabacher planned--in his capacity as chair of the Europe subcommittee--to hold a hearing on the , which bars certain Russian officials from entering the United States or holding any financial assets in American banks. Rohrabacher reportedly wanted , the American-born investor who had lobbied for the act's passage after what he claims was the illegal appropriation of his 's assets and the subsequent murder of his Russian lawyer, to testify. Rohrabacher planned to subject him to what was described as a \"\". In addition to questioning Browder closely and skeptically about his claims, Rohrabacher intended to show a feature-length  critical of the Magnitsky claims. Another scheduled witness was Russian lawyer , a longtime lobbyist against the Magnitsky Act who attended the June 9 . In July 2017, Browder testified to the  that persons supporting the interests of foreign governments or acting on their behalf, especially Russia, must comply with  requirements, and that no one behind the screening of the Andrei Nekrasov film had met the disclosure filings under FARA.\n\nWhen Foreign Affairs Committee chairman  learned of Rohrabacher's plans, he canceled the hearing and forbade Rohrabacher from showing the film. In its stead, he held a full committee hearing on U.S.-Russia relations at which Rohrabacher was allowed to submit some of the pro-Russian claims into evidence. The film was ultimately shown at the , and an intern in Rohrabacher's office who later worked for the Trump transition team sent emails promoting the film from the subcommittee offices.\n\nAfter  won the 2016 presidential election, Rohrabacher defended his approach to improving . He had previously met at least twice with , a former Soviet spy \"who met with President Trump's son, son-in-law and campaign manager in June 2016\", to discuss Russian sanctions.\n\nIn a May 2017 interview with , Rohrabacher said, \"'We have a huge double standard with Russia when it comes to prisoners and other things'\". Rohrabacher added that interference by the Russian intelligence services' in the 2016 U.S. election was the same as the  (NSA) bugging German Chancellor  phone.\n\nIn July 2017, Rohrabacher voted to impose sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia.\n\nOn 16 August 2017, Rohrabacher visited  in the  and told him that Trump would pardon him on the condition that he would agree to say that Russia was not involved in the s. At his extradition hearings in 2020, Assange's defense team alleged in court that this offer was made \"on instructions from the president\". Trump and Rohrabacher subsequently said they had never spoken about the offer, and Rohrabacher said he had made the offer on his own initiative.\n\nIn October 2017, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs placed restrictions on Rohrabacher's ability to use committee money to pay for foreign travel due to concerns over his interest in Russia.\n\nOn November 21, 2017, '''' reported that Rohrabacher had come under scrutiny from special counsel  and the  for his close ties to the .\n (CPAC)]]\n and Kirk Elder accept  on behalf of Staff Sgt. Randolph Elder]]\n\nIn an interview with  Channel on August 24, 2018, Rohrabacher attacked Attorney General  because Sessions had refused to fire Robert Mueller and shut down the . He said: \"'The fact that Jeff Sessions has not quit is a disloyalty to this president and to the country, the fact is, if he disagrees with what the president wants him to do, he should resign'\".\n\nIn February 2020, Rohrabacher told  that his goal during his 2017 meeting with  was to find evidence for a  that ' real source was not  agents for  but former DNC staffer . , a White House spokesperson for President Trump, stated that Trump barely knew Rohrabacher and had not spoken with Rohrabacher \"'on this subject or almost any subject'\". \n\nOn February 19, 2020, , Julian Assange's barrister, asserted at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London that Rohrabacher had been sent on behalf of President Trump in August 2017 to offer Assange a pardon from Trump if Assange could release material to show that Russian intelligence were not involved in the 2016 United States election interference.\n\n\nIn 2006, Rohrabacher chaired the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the , which investigated whether the Oklahoma City bombers had assistance from foreign sources; the committee determined there was no conclusive evidence of a foreign connection. In the , Rohrabacher was chair of the .\n\nSpeaking about Islam, he said during a hearing in April 2013, \"I hope we all work together against a religion that will motivate people to murder children and other threats to us as a civilization.\"\n\nIn the wake of the 2016 , Rohrabacher put out a press release stating that he felt \"outrage\" and a \"renewed commitment to defeat and destroy the radical Islamic movement that fosters such mayhem.\" He stressed that Americans must \"be sure not to label all Muslims as terrorist murderers.\" Rohrabacher met Seddique Mateen, the father of the shooter, in 2014 during routine meetings with constituents. He called Mateen an \"estranged individual.\"\n\nIn a statement to clarify his position, Rohrabacher wrote that he opposes \"the use of force against unarmed civilians no matter who is the victim or who is doing the killing\" but he is also against \"Iran's vicious Mullah monarchy\" and \"when it comes to Sunni terrorists or Shiite terrorists, I prefer them to target each other rather than any other victims, especially innocent civilians and Americans.\" He added that it will \"require support for those proud Iranians who want to win their freedom and heritage from Mullahs and are willing to fight for it. That does not include Isis, but it may include a lot of Iranians who see blowing up Khomeini's mausoleum as an expression of freedom from the yolk [sic] of Islamic terror.\"\n\n\nOn April 17, 2007, during a House hearing on trans-Atlantic relations, Rohrabacher defended the Bush administration's program of . He said that the unfair treatment of one innocent suspect is an acceptable \"unfortunate consequence\" of holding others who would otherwise be free to commit terror acts. After he received boos and groans from the gallery, Rohrabacher responded, \"Well, I hope it's your families, I hope it's your families that suffer the consequences,\" and \"I hope it's your family members that die.\" Rohrabacher was subsequently interrupted by protesters wearing orange jumpsuits who were removed from the gallery. For his comment that imprisoning and torturing one innocent person was a fair price to pay for locking up 50 terrorists who would \"go out and plant a bomb and kill 20,000 people\", on April 25 Rohrabacher was named ''Countdown with Keith Olbermann's'' \"Worst Person in the World\".\n\n\nRohrabacher's interest in Afghanistan extends back at least to the late 1980s, before his time in office, when he entered the country in the company of  fighters who were fighting . Reportedly, these fighters \"actually engaged Soviet troops in combat near the city of  during the two months Rohrabacher was with them.\" In the years after the  (1979–1989), Rohrabacher said his \"passion\" was to bring back the country's exiled king, .\n\nIn 2003, Rohrabacher defended the new Afghan constitution against those who saw in it mainly empowerment of warlords, saying:\n\n}}\n\nRohrabacher has since become a proponent of withdrawing from Afghanistan. He protested against the troop build-up in Afghanistan by President Obama, saying \"If the Taliban is going is be defeated, it's got to be by the Afghan people themselves, not by sending more U.S. troops, which could actually be counterproductive.\" When Congressman  offered an amendment in 2011 requiring the Pentagon to draw up an exit plan from Afghanistan, Rohrabacher was just one of six Republicans to sign on. Rohrabacher voted for McGovern's Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, requiring an exit plan from Afghanistan. The bill failed by a 204–215 margin.\n\nRohrabacher was against former President Obama's gradual drawdown of troops, instead supporting a full withdrawal. Saying \"If we're going to leave, we should leave.\" Rohrabacher has said that \"The centralized system of government foisted upon the Afghan people is not going to hold after we leave.\" And \"So let's quit prolonging the agony and inevitable. Karzai's regime is corrupt and non representative of Afghanistan's tribal culture. This failed strategy is not worth one more drop of American blood. Under the current strategy, our military presence alienates more Afghans that it pacifies. So if you're going to pull the plug, then we need to get the hell out now.\" Rohrabacher has repeatedly raised high-level concerns in the  and Washington, D.C., about the significant , including the  scandal, where hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars allegedly disappeared in a short period of time at the apparent hands of close Karzai family members, including brothers  (a.k.a. Mahmood Karzai) and . Rohrabacher worked to bring attention to the systemic corruption in the Karzai government and cut U.S. taxpayers' funding for these wasteful projects and programs, involving corruption within the  government.\n\nIn April 2012, CNN reported that \"A top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee was asked by the State Department not to go to Afghanistan because President Hamid Karzai objected to the visit. ... Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, told Security Clearance he was readying to travel with five other Republicans from Dubai to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, when the State Department requested he stay behind.\"\n\n\n California State Convention]]\nRohrabacher was opposed to the involvement of American ground troops in the . He advocated for the direct bombing of the military on Yugoslav soil, criticizing the ineffectiveness of western forces against the Bosnian Serbs. (NATO was limited to small fixed attacks, as these Serbs penetrated UN safe areas and attacked Bosniak forces.) Rohrabacher said they \"should bomb Serbia's military infrastructure, in Serbia – get that, in Serbia – rather than dropping a couple of duds on tents, which only proves the West's gutlessness, and emboldens Serbian cutthroats.\" Rohrabacher considered . In 1995, Rohrabacher personally visited  in Bosnia, criticizing the devastation Serb forces inflicted on the city, saying \"This is a loss to all mankind, not just to the people of Sarajevo.\" He also encountered vagabond children asking for money.\n\nIn 2001, the leader of the  ethnic lobby group, , praised Rohrabacher for his support to the  (KLA), a militia that was once labeled by Bill Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans  as a terrorist organization, saying \"He was the first member of Congress to insist that the United States arm the Kosova Liberation Army, and one of the few members who to this day publicly supports the independence of Kosova.\" Also in 2001, Rohrabacher gave a speech in support of American equipping the KLA with weaponry, comparing it to French support of America in the Revolutionary War, saying \"Based on our own experience, the Kosova Liberation Army should have been armed. ... If the U.S. had armed the KLA in 1998, we would not be where we are today. The 'freedom fighters' would have secured their freedom and Kosova would be independent.\"\n\n\nAfter a reconnaissance flight over the  in 1998, Rohrabacher said, \"We can't ignore this bullying by the Communist Chinese in the Spratlys. The presence of the Chinese military troops...is not only a concern of the Philippines. It is also a concern of the U.S. and other democratic countries in the world.\"\n\nIn July 1999, Rohrabacher led the House floor in opposition to legislation normalizing trade ties between the United States and China. The following year, as the House weighed another China trade bill, Rohrabacher said the trade bill was a giveaway to a select number of American billionaires and the Beijing regime, adding that President  could call \"communist China 'our strategic partner' until his face turns blue, but it won't make them any less red.\"\n\nIn 2011 interviews, Rohrabacher described the Chinese government under the leadership of  as \"a gangster regime that murders its own people\" and described the Chinese government as Nazis.\n\nIn December 2016, after President-elect Trump had a phone call with  , Rohrabacher said the call had \"showed the dictators in Beijing that he's not a pushover\" and that China \"has had an enormously aggressive foreign policy\".\n\n\n\nIn 2012 Rohrabacher stated,\n\n\n\nand\n\n, Joint Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, , September 12, 2012}}\n\n\nRohrabacher voted in support of the  in 2002, a position that he later said was \"a mistake\".\n\n\nIn August 2012, Rohrabacher noted on his official website that he had written a letter addressed to the U.S. State Department, noting his support of U.S. sponsorship of separatist movements in Iran. This elicited criticism from the Iranian-American community, which included challenging Rohrabacher's understanding of the historical background alluded to in his letter to the Department of State.\n\nIn June 2017, a day after an , during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rohrabacher stated: \"Isn't it a good thing for us to have the United States finally backing up Sunnis who will attack Hezbollah and the Shiite threat to us, isn't that a good thing?\" This comment was strongly criticized by the , which wrote, \"Rohrabacher has a long history of bizarre and offensive statements on Iran, but his callousness toward the Iranian victims of ISIS terror might be his most callous and extreme thus far.\"\n\nRohrabacher supported removing the  (MEK) from the ; it was included on the list from 1997 to 2012.\n\n\nIn May 2011, in the wake of Osama Bin Laden's death, Rohrabacher introduced a bill to stop aid to Pakistan, stating that members of the government and of Pakistan's security force, the ISI, were either sheltering Bin Laden or completely incompetent. \"We can no longer afford this foolishness. ... The time has come for us to stop subsidizing those who actively oppose us. Pakistan has shown itself not to be America's ally.\" Rohrabacher also demanded the return of the US helicopter that crashed in the operation to kill Bin Laden, stating \"If this is not done immediately, it is probable, given Pakistan's history, that our technology has already found its way into the hands of the Communist Chinese military that is buying, building, and stealing the necessary military technology to challenge the United States.\"\n\nIn June 2017, while speaking to Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs , Rohrabacher said, \"We need to go on the record here, in this part of our government, to say that we're not going to be providing weapons systems to Pakistan that we're afraid are going to shoot down our own people. And we know they're engaged in terrorism.\"\n\n\nIn 2007, Rohrabacher supported Mohiuddin Ahmed, a detainee in the U.S., who was said to be involved in an attempted coup in Bangladesh, during which several people were murdered. He was convicted of the , the first President of Bangladesh. Bangladesh's extradition request was halted as Rohrabacher voiced concern about his legal rights, saying that he should be sent somewhere with no death penalty. His support was applauded by both  and the . Mohiuddin Ahmed was found guilty of being a participant in the assassinations and was executed on January 28, 2010.\n\n\n State Convention]]\nAfter President-elect  answered a congratulatory phone call from    on December 2, 2016, Rohrabacher said Trump's phone call with Taiwan's president was \"terrific\" because of the diplomatic warning it sent to China. \"He showed the dictators in Beijing that he's not a pushover.\" He emphasized, \"China has had an enormously aggressive foreign policy and by him actually going to Taiwan, he's showing the people in Beijing that they cannot have this aggressive foreign policy and expect to be treated just the same by an American president.\"\n\n\nRohrabacher gave a \"qualified defense\" of the  in 2014.Elias Isquith, March 25, 2014, Salon magazine,  , Retrieved August 1, 2017, \"...Rohrabacher went off-script for a moment and offered a qualified defense of Russia's annexation of Crimea...\" On March 6, 2014, he was one of 23 members of the House of Representatives to vote against a $1&nbsp;billion loan guarantee to support the new government of Ukraine. On March 11, 2014, Rohrabacher voted \"\", the only member to do so, on a resolution condemning Russian military actions in Ukraine; the resolution passed 402-7. Commenting on the issue, he stated, \"Starting with our own , groups of people have declared themselves, rightfully, to be under a different government or a government of their choosing. People forget that's what our  is all about.\" He also said, \"The sanctions are an abomination of hypocrisy. This is ridiculous: What we were doing with the violence and  to secure the Kosovars' right to self-determination was far more destructive and had far more loss of life than what Putin's done trying to ensure the people of Crimea are not cut off from what they would choose as their destiny with Russia.\"\n\n\nDuring a US Congressional delegation's visit to Uzbekistan in February 2013, Rohrabacher made several controversial statements. The chief among those statements was that the United States should treat Uzbekistan like Saudi Arabia by disregarding the former's human rights abuses in achieving America's national interests, particularly in selling armaments and drones to Uzbekistan.\n\n\nIn 2017, in an interview for an n TV channel  Rohrabacher suggested that  \"is not a country\" and that the \" and  from Macedonia should be part of  and the rest of Macedonia should be part of  or any other country to which they believe they are related\", which provoked a response from the Macedonian foreign ministry which accused him of inflaming \"nationalistic rhetoric\".\n\n\nIn the wake of the  in May 2017, Rohrabacher called  to never invite   again to the United States, and to bar Americans from purchasing Turkish government debt.\n\n\nIn August 2017, Rohrabacher proposed amending the  budget whereby the United States would establish military ties with . Rohrabacher suggested that the two countries should cooperate in fighting the , curbing Iranian influence in the , and securing the  region. At the time of Rohrabacher's proposal, Eritrea was subject to international sanctions due to its alleged support of  in , and to U.S. sanctions against the  following an alleged shipment of n military hardware to Eritrea.\n\n\nIn August 2017, Rohrabacher attended a meeting in London with  organized and attended by right-wing political activist . Rohrabacher said that the discussion was about the possibility of a presidential pardon in exchange for Assange supplying information on the , which were published by  before the . In October 2017, Rohrabacher and Johnson met with Senator  (R-Kentucky) to discuss Assange supplying information about the source of leaked emails. However, Assange responded to news accounts of the meeting, tweeting, \"WikiLeaks never has and never will reveal a source. Offers have been made to menot the other way around. I do not speak to the public through third parties.\"\n\n\n\nIn March 2005, Rohrabacher introduced HR 1061, the American Property Claims Against Ethiopia Act, which would \"prohibit United States assistance to the Federal Democratic Republic of  until the Ethiopian government returns all property of United States citizens\". The bill was introduced by Rohrabacher at the behest of Gebremedhin Berhane, a former n national and friend of the Rohrabacher family, after his business was expropriated by the Ethiopian government.\n\nOn March 7, 2006, Rohrabacher introduced HR 4895, an amendment to the  of 1961, \"to limit the provision of the United States military assistance and the sale, transfer, or licensing of United States military equipment or technology to Ethiopia\".\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC's '''', Rohrabacher accused Barack Obama of allowing violence in  to get out of hand because he did not speak forcefully enough against the country's leadership. He also said that Gorbachev tore down the Berlin Wall because Reagan told him to (\"\").\n\nIn early 2010, he went to Honduras to commend the election of the new president. His entourage included a group of Californian property investors and businessmen, a dealer in rare coins, and CEOs from San Diego biofuels corporation (which is headed by a family friend).\n\n\n\nRohrabacher voted to repeal , disputed evidence of man-made , was a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, and favored the . \n\nRohrabacher had drawn public criticism for some of his positions. His controversial statements included the , first promoted by the politically-biased conspiracy theory website , that Democrats secretly organized the  in Charlottesville to provoke violence by the  to discredit President Trump.\n\nHe had been a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.\n\n\nIn 1990, Rohrabacher opposed the  and joined  in demanding its abolition. In a February letter to other members of Congress, Rohrabacher sent a photograph by artist and  activist . \n\nIn April, liberal constitutional rights group  announced its intent to launch a newspaper advert campaign against Rohrabacher. Western vice president of the organization Michael Hudson stated, \"'Americans overwhelmingly reject censorship of the arts and support the NEA'\". Rohrabacher welcomed the announcement, stating that his constituents \"don't want federal dollars to go to sacrilegious or obscene art'\" and that it would help voters to understand the issue. Explaining his position, Rohrabacher stated that he did not believe \"'anyone should be prevented from seeing what they want to see or painting what they want to paint...on their own time and their own dime. But if you get a government subsidy, that's another question'\".\n\nIn October, the House passed a bill to reauthorize funds for the NEA with the directive that the organization could not fund obscene art. Rohrabacher introduced an amendment that would include specific guidelines on the kind of art projects that could not be funded, such as works that were sexually explicit or denigrated the American flag or religions; the amendment was rejected by a vote of 249-175. Rohrabacher stated his amendment was supposed to ensure that the federal government was \"\"not subsidizing obscenity, child pornography, attacks on religion, desecration of the American flag or any other of the outrages we have seen in the past'\". By the time the House passed the bill, Rohrabacher had become known as \" the House's most outspoken critic of the NEA\".\n\n\nIn October 1991, Rohrabacher wrote a letter to the civil rights division of the Education Department after seven Filipino students complained to the media that they were denied admission to the  (UCSD). Rohrabacher requested the department conduct a federal civil rights investigation on what seemed to be \"a quota based upon race that illegally discriminates against Filipino-Americans and possibly applicants of other races\". UCSD vice chancellor for undergraduate affairs Joseph Watson refuted the letter, dismissing Rohrabacher as \"wrong when he says that 40% of admissions are reserved for certain races\". He stated that the school ranks all applicants using a grade-based formula. Watson charged Rohrabacher with fanning hysteria over discrimination: \"The Rohrabacher approach is to play to public fears that something fishy is going on. We don't want anyone to feel we're not giving everyone a fair and equitable review that can stand up to any scrutiny.\"\n\n\n\nIn November 1997, Rohrabacher was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor  by  that sought to launch an  against President . The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the . The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Rohrabacher voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open . On December 19, 1998, Rohrabacher voted in favor of all four proposed  of  against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted).\n\n\nIn 2018, 's television program '''' premiered, showing Rohrabacher supporting a hoax \"kinderguardians program\" which supported training toddlers with firearms.Matthew Michaels, July 15, 2018, Business Insider,  , Retrieved July 15, 2018 Rohrabacher claims that he never spoke to Cohen, that he was taken out of context, and that he spoke, \"broadly of making sure young people could get training in self-defense\".\n\n\nRohrabacher  the  that  is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by  released into the  by \"dinosaur flatulence\": '''' and ''The New York Times'' reported that on May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming and suggested that, if global warming is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and replanting. These reports sparked strong criticism by some scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the . They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming.\n\nRohrabacher does not believe that global warming is a problem. At a town hall meeting with the Newport Mesa Tea Party in August 2013, Rohrabacher said \"global warming is a total fraud\" and part of a \"game plan\" by liberals to \"create global government\".\n\n\nOn May 4, 2017, Rohrabacher voted in favor of repealing the  (Obamacare) and passing the . During his 2018 re-election campaign, Rohrabacher pledged to protect protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Rohrabacher voted for his party's Obamacare replacement bill that included state waivers from rules that prohibit charging higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\nRohrabacher was an advocate for the state of California's , which prohibited illegal immigrants from acquiring government services. In 2004, he sponsored an amendment that would have prohibited federal reimbursement of hospital-provided emergency care and certain transportation services to undocumented aliens unless the hospital provided information about the aliens' citizenship, immigration status, financial data, and employer to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Aliens who were in the country illegally would receive reimbursement only after they were deported. The proposed bill was defeated, 331–88.\n\nIn 2005, Rohrabacher opined that the Republican Party was split on the issue of immigration: \"There are those of us who identify with the national wing and patriotic wing of the party who have always been adamant on the illegal immigration issues. And, on the other side, you have those people who believe in the business and global marketplace concept. So, you have a party with two different views on one of the major issues of the day.\"\n\nIn early 2008, Rohrabacher endorsed  in the Republican presidential primary, citing his positions on stemming illegal immigration and criticizing . About McCain, he said: \"He's been the enemy of those of us who have stemmed the flow of illegals into our country, whereas Romney has made some very tough commitments.\"\n\nIn 2011, Rohrabacher proposed the bill H.R. 787 known as the \"No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2011\". The bill: \"Amends title II of the Social Security Act to exclude from creditable wages and self-employment income any wages earned for services by aliens performed in the United States, and self-employment income derived from a trade or business conducted in the United States, while the alien was not authorized to be so employed or to perform a function or service in such a trade or business.\"\n\nIn 2013, an 18-year-old student visited Rohrabacher's office to discuss immigration reform. At some point their conversation became disagreeable, and the student said the congressman yelled at her: \"I hate illegals!\" He also allegedly threatened to deport her family. Rohrabacher's spokesperson has disputed both statements, averring that it was actually the student who started the confrontation by yelling at the spokesperson and telling her to \"butt out\".\n\nIn September 2017, Rohrabacher supported the Trump administration's rescinding of the  program, saying that those \"in Congress must work to prevent such cynical loopholes from being created again by executive fiat\" despite their possible empathy for the immigrants.\n\nThe organization  has given Rep. Rohrabacher an A+ rating in accordance to his stance on illegal immigration.\n\n\nRohrabacher has drawn controversy over his views on LGBT rights. He opposed  and endorsed , the ballot initiative in 2008 that would have prohibited same-sex marriage in California, during a debate at , stating he \"would suggest not changing the definition of marriage in our society to make a small number of people feel more comfortable\".\n\nRohrabacher voted in favor of the  in both 2004 and 2006, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman and forbade states from recognizing or legalizing same-sex marriage. After the  issued its decision in '''' in 2013, that legalized , Rohrabacher criticized the decision, stating that the decision was \"not based on the merits of the issue but on a technicality\". However, Rohrabacher has appeared to have endorsed the idea of , stating on  that churches should be solely responsible for conducting marriages but that the government should only recognize them.\n\nIn May 2018, Rohrabacher provoked severe criticism after telling a meeting of the Orange County Association of Realtors that homeowners \"should be able to make a decision not to sell their home to someone (if) they don't agree with their lifestyle.\" Though the statement did not explicitly refer to LGBT people, it was widely interpreted as such. LGBT groups denounced Rohrabacher for the remarks, and the , which had previously donated to Rohrabacher's re-election campaigns, condemned Rohrabacher, halted all of its financial support for him and repudiated its past donations to him. After Rohrabacher's constituents unseated him in favor of , '''' praised the results and condemned Rohrabacher.\n\nDespite criticism from the LGBT community later in his career, early in his political career, Rohrabacher supported a proposal by gays to move to a rural California county and take leadership roles. Rohrabacher's \"California Libertarian Alliance endorsed the project. 'Your main resources are the freedom you offer plus the environment you are locating in,' Dana Rohrabacher, one of the libertarian group’s founders and later speechwriter to then-President Reagan, wrote in a letter to GLF. 'The economic goods are perfect for some kind of a combination ski gambling resort.'\" \n\n\n]]\nRohrabacher supported the legalization of  for both  and  purposes. He spoke against the policy of cannabis prohibition as early as May 2013, calling it a \"colossal failure\" in an op-ed penned for the ''''. He further outlined his views in a May 2014 op-ed in '''', arguing that the prohibition of cannabis has incurred a number of undesirable costs upon free society, such as an increase in gang violence, soaring incarceration rates, unconstitutional seizure of private property through , corruption and  forces, and negative impacts on minority communities and relationships with  countries.

''The San Jose Mercury News'' called him \"perhaps the best-trained governor-in-waiting California has ever produced.\" In March 1999, Davis enjoyed a 58% approval rating and just 12% disapproval.

CalPERS predicted the benefits would require no increase in the State's contributions by projecting an average annual return of 8.25% over the next decade. When Board member Phil Angelides' aide questioned whether the stock market could grow that long, Board Chairman William Crist, a former union president, replied that they \"could make all sorts of different assumptions and make predictions, but that's really more than I think we can expect our staff to do.\" CalPERS' chief actuary, objected, finding that it would be \"fairly catastrophic\" if the fund only grew at 4.4%. The benefits expansion bill, SB 400, passed with unanimous backing by California State Assembly Democrats and was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis. CalPERS then produced a video promoting the legislation with Chairman Crist promising greater benefits \"without imposing any additional cost on the taxpayers\" and the California State Employees Association president praising it as \"the biggest thing since sliced bread\". The next year the dot-com bubble burst, and CalPERS did not grow, instead losing value in the stock market downturn of 2002. In 2001–2002, CalPERS provided technical assistance for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because it had sustained financial losses from the Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies. After the Great Recession, in 2009 CalPERS investments lost 24%, dropping $67 billion in value. Chairman Crist retired from the board and it was later revealed he had accepted more than $800,000 from a firm to ensure hundreds of millions of investment from CalPERS. This CalPERS mess was one of the factors that made Gray Davis get recalled. Governor  Jerry Brown worked on trying to fix this retirement system for years, but CalPERS is still underfunded in 2022 and could end up costing state tax payers hundreds of billions in bailouts.\n\n\nDavis recognized the domestic partnerships registry in 1999 and, in 2001, gave same-sex partners a few of the rights enjoyed by opposite-sex spouses such as making health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, acting as a conservator and inheriting property.

Davis's ban included a ban on .50 caliber firearms and so-called \"Saturday Night Specials.\" In 2001, Davis signed a bill requiring gun buyers to pass a safety test.\n\n\nA supporter of the death penalty and tougher sentencing laws, Davis blocked nearly all parole recommendations by the parole board. Davis campaigned as an ardent supporter of capital punishment; which reportedly played a crucial part in his successful gubernatorial campaign. In 1999, he denied his first clemency request from Thai national , stating, \"Model behavior cannot bring back the lives of the two innocent murder victims.\" Siripongs was executed in February 1999; the first execution to occur during Davis's governorship.\n\n\nEarly in 1999, Davis sought to improve relations with Mexico. Davis believed that California under  had left millions of dollars of potential trade revenues \"on the table.\" Davis said he wanted California to have relations with Mexico that were more like  under then-Governor .

Davis later met with President  and participated in his inauguration. The Governor met with Mexican presidents eight times. Under the Davis administration, California and  signed a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" expanding cooperation in several policy areas. Under Davis, Mexico became California's leading export market for the first time in history and California's trade with Mexico surpassed all of Mexico's trade with Latin America, Europe and Asia combined. Because of the growth in the California economy, Davis opened and expanded trade offices around the world, including in Mexico. But most of these offices were eliminated in the 2003 California budget due to difficult fiscal times.\n\n\nDavis significantly expanded the number of low-income children with state-subsidized health coverage.

Under Davis, benefits for injured and unemployed workers increased. The minimum wage increased by $1 to $6.75. Davis backed higher research and development tax credits. He pushed for elimination of the minimum franchise tax paid by new businesses during the first two years of operation.\n\nWhile Davis's record is generally considered pro-environmental due to increases in spending for land acquisition, maintenance of the state's park system, signing legislation that attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions by having automakers produce more efficient vehicles, cutting fees to state parks and opposing , he was criticized for not backing tougher restrictions on timber companies as some environmentalists desired. Under the Davis administration, California purchased  for urban parks.\n\nDavis signed the first state law in the US in July 2002 to require automakers to limit auto emissions. The law required the California Air Resources Board to obtain the \"maximum feasible\" cuts in greenhouse gases emitted by all non-commercial vehicles in 2009 and beyond. Automakers claimed the law would lead smaller and more expensive cars to be sold in California. In 2003, Davis signed legislation aiming to ban .\n\nOn March 25, 1999, Davis issued an  calling for the removal of  (a toxic gasoline additive) from gasoline sold in the state. In 2001, in order for gas prices to remain reasonable in California while removing MTBE, Davis asked President  to order the EPA to grant California a waiver on the federal minimum oxygen requirement. Without a waiver, California would have to import a much larger amount of  per year and gas prices were projected to increase drastically. Bush did not grant the waiver and in 2002, Davis issued an executive order reversing his earlier executive order.\n\nDavis's actions when it came to regulating business suggested that Davis was a more moderate governor. He worked to kill a comprehensive bill opposed by banks and insurance companies to protect consumers' personal financial information. \"What you saw in the campaign was what you got,\" said UC Berkeley professor Bruce Cain. \"He's tried to negotiate a course between the different interest groups and keep Democrats on a more centrist, business-oriented track\".\n\nDavis approved $5.3 billion over five years for more than 150 transit and highway projects. One of those projects was construction on the new eastern section of the . During 1999 and 2000, California spent millions on onetime projects like buying new rail cars and track improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after taking office, Davis was able to fast-track the first power plant construction in twelve years in April 1999, although the plant did not come on line before the electricity crisis.\n\nAccording to the subsequent 's investigation and report, numerous energy trading companies, many based in Texas, such as , illegally restricted their supply to the point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts. s affecting 97,000 customers hit the San Francisco Bay area on June 14, 2000, and  filed a complaint alleging  by some energy producers in August 2000. On December 7, 2000, suffering from low supply and idled power plants, the  (CAISO), which manages the California power grid, declared the first statewide Stage 3 power alert, meaning power reserves were below 3 percent. Rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity.\n\n\nOn January 17, 2001, Davis declared a state of emergency in response to the electricity crisis. Speculators, led by , were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks and finally suffered rolling blackouts on January 17 and 18. Davis stepped in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market, since the California power companies were technically bankrupt and had no buying power. California agreed to pay $43 billion for power over the next 20 years. Newspaper publishers sued Davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal.  by Glendhill, Lynda. The San Francisco Chronicle. Sunday, February 17, 2002. Retrieved August 14, 2007.\n\nDuring the electricity crisis, the Davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption. These efforts, the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a 14.1% reduction in electricity usage from June 2000 to June 2001.\n\nGray Davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the s and say that Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as , alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by s from energy producers. Some of Davis's energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. Some conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow electricity prices to rise for residences statewide much as they had in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to Davis's recall.\n\n\n\nIn a speech at  on August 19, 2003, Davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis, but then forcefully attacked the -based energy suppliers: \"I inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers. We got no help from the Federal government. In fact, when I was fighting  and the other energy companies, these same companies were sitting down with Vice President Cheney to draft a national energy strategy.\"\n\nWhen the Enron verdicts were rendered years later, convicting Enron and other companies of market manipulation, Davis responded with the following quote:\n\n (Skilling's conviction was later overturned by the  in its narrowing of the \"honest services\" statute.)\n\nOn November 13, 2003, shortly before leaving office, Davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on January 17, 2001. The state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies. The emergency authority allowed Davis to order the  to streamline the application process for new power plants. During that time, California issued licenses to 38 new power plants, amounting to 14,365 megawatts of electricity production when completed.\n\nIn 2006, the '''' published an article that credited Davis's signing of the long-term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing California a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy.\n\nIn March 2003, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's long-awaited report on the so-called \"energy crisis\" was released. That report substantially vindicated Davis, laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of California's treasury on deliberate tactics employed by some 25 energy trading companies, most of which were based in Texas. Of the latter, the most notable was , a number of whose principals were subsequently criminally prosecuted for their roles.\n\n\nDuring the economic boom years of the Davis administration, the California budget expanded to cover Davis's new programs. California's low national K-12 education rankings and Davis's campaign pledge to help education, along with the large majority that elected Davis to his first term and his early popularity, suggest that a majority of Californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when California was in budget surplus. Polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the California voters. Under the Davis administration, taxes were cut by over $5.1 billion that included a $3.5 billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees. The cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a 1991 law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed 4 percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in 1999 and 2000. Davis also vetoed $5.1 billion in appropriations during that span.\n\n\nWhile California's economy was expanding, California was producing record budget surpluses under Davis even after his tax cuts and new spending. According to the California Department of Finance, California, had a 10% surplus at the end of 1999 and California was projected to have a 4% surplus at the end fiscal year 2000. These surplus monies were left in the treasury. Davis claimed to be cautious with state finances.\n\n\n\nThe  that had been fueling California's record tax revenues went bust. California was home to a large number of high tech firms and was largely dependent on state income taxes. State revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits. Restoring the vehicle licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the state's credit rating became unpopular. The beginning shortfall for the 2002-2003 state budget was $23.6 billion. Davis announced that the 2003-2004 budget shortfall would be $34.6 billion while the Legislative Analyst projected a $21.1.\n\n\nDavis, a moderate, had some disagreements with the more liberal Democratic-controlled Legislature. Democrat , the leader of the , was Davis's chief antagonist.\n\n\nIn May 2001, in the middle of the , his numbers declined to 42% approval and 49% disapproval. By December 2001, Davis's approval ratings spiked up to 51%. His numbers declined back to the May 2001 level and remained about the same over the next year. In April 2003, Davis had a 24% approval rating and 65% disapproval rating. The leading causes of Davis's steep decline in popularity (and eventual recall) were the , which involved a sharp increase in electricity rates and a series of blackouts in 2001, as well as voter discontent with an increase in state car registration taxes.\n\nDavis had tried to maintain a middle-of-the-road approach, but ultimately alienated many of the state's liberals who viewed him as too conservative and many conservatives who viewed him as too liberal. Many were upset that in trying to balance the budget, Davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons. Some critics attributed the proposal to the s donations to Davis's re-election campaign.\n\n\n\n\nDavis began fundraising for his 2002 reelection campaign early in his governorship. Davis raised $13.2 million in 1999 and $14.2 million in 2000, both unprecedented sums at the time so early in an elected term.Gladstone, Mark. \"California Governor Raises Record Funding for Campaign.\" . February 2, 2001. Copyright 2001 News Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. Accessed from LexisNexus July 22, 2007. Davis's 1999 and 2000 contributions included contributions from Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International. Davis also received large contributions from labor groups, environmental groups and individuals.\n\nDavis's fundraising efforts attracted much attention. 's Institute of Government Studies claimed that Davis's fundraising skills were \"second to none in the political arena\" while Senator  called Davis's 2001 goal of $26 million \"disgraceful.\"  by Staff of Institute of Government Studies. University of California Berkeley. Retrieved August 13, 2007. One article in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' claimed that Davis was raising $34,000 a day. Although Davis's fundraising pace was criticized by his many detractors,  would later collect contributions at a quicker rate during the early years of his governorship. Arnoldwatch.org, a project of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both Democrats and Republicans, called Davis a \"pay to play\" politician and a \"sellout\".\n\nDuring the 2002 election campaign, Davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the Republican  against Los Angeles mayor . Davis claimed that Riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record. Polls showed that, as a moderate, Riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate. Polls even showed that Riordan would defeat Davis. Davis attacked Riordian with negative ads in the primary. The ads questioned Riordan's pro-choice stance by questioning Riordan's support of pro-life politicians and judges. The ads pointed out Riordan's position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of Gray Davis, who strongly supported it.\n\nDavis's negative ads against Riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the 2002 election page, led to Riordan's defeat in the Republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate . In the first 10 weeks of 2002, Davis spent $10 million on ads: $3 million on positive ads boasting of his record, $7 million on negative ads against Riordan.\n\nDavis was re-elected in the November 2002 general election following a long and bitter campaign against Simon, marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy. Simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished Simon's reputation. Davis's campaign touted California's improving test scores, environmental protection, health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors. Davis's campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted Simon's financial fraud scandal.  by , Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers. The San Francisco Chronicle. Friday, August 16, 2002. The 2002 gubernatorial race was the most expensive in California state history with over $100 million spent. Davis's campaign was better financed; Davis had over $26 million more in campaign reserves than Simon in August 2002. Davis gained re-election with 47.4% of the vote to Simon's 42.4%. However, the Simon-Davis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history, allowing a lower than normal number of signatures required for a recall. Davis won the election, but the majority of voters disliked Davis and did not approve of his job performance.\n\n\n\n\nDavis's second term, which lasted only ten months, was dominated by the . He was widely criticized for responding to the budget crisis by reversing a decade of fee reductions on motor vehicles, a decision which his opponents repeatedly referenced. Not long after Davis signed a law allowing the Department of Motor Vehicles to grant driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, he was challenged to a recall election. Davis had also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people, and vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college.State Net California Journal. \"From the Floor - Gray Davis' final acts.\" Copyright 2003 State Net(R).

Some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from Hispanics, labor union members and liberal Democrats. Ultimately, Davis did not have as much support from Hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his 2002 re-election.\n\n, President  and Governor Gray Davis speak to firefighters on November 4, 2003.]]\n\nDavis was governor during the southern California fires of 2003, more commonly known as the . Davis declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, San Diego County and Ventura County in October 2003 and deployed the National Guard to help with disaster relief. By mid-November, the greater South Los Angeles area had been declared a disaster area. This enabled federal funding to help repair flooding and weather-related damage, including the destruction of thousands of acres of vegetation. The Cedar Fire was the last major event during Davis's tenure as governor. Both Davis and governor-elect Schwarzenegger worked to help with disaster relief. Schwarzenegger went to Washington, D.C., and met Vice President  to lobby the federal government for more disaster relief funds.\n\nDavis spent 1,778 days as governor and signed 5,132 bills out of 6,244, vetoing 1,112 bills.\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2003, a sufficient number of citizen signatures were collected for a . The initial drive for the recall was fueled by funds from the personal fortune of  , a Republican who originally hoped to replace Davis himself. The 2003 California recall special election was the goal of the \"Dump Davis\" campaign and constituted the first gubernatorial recall in Californian history and only the second in U.S. history. Later,  of  of  in 2012 would be the third and the  of  would be the fourth in September 2021.\n\nEarly in the runup to the recall election, Davis called the recall election an \"insult\" to the eight million voters who had voted in the 2002 gubernatorial election. The Davis campaign tried to run against the recall Yes/No vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him. Davis tried to depict the recall as a $66 million waste of money that could allow a candidate with a very small percentage of the vote to become Governorpotentially someone who was very liberal or conservative as there are no primaries in a recall election. Davis tried to run \"outside the recall circus\" and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for California, and who had made improvements to education and healthcare. Early August polls showed that over 50% supported the recall.\n\nIn September 2003, Davis conceded that he had lost touch with the voters and added that he was holding numerous townhall meetings in an effort to address the problem.  by Salladay, Robert & Coile, Zachary. The San Francisco Chronicle. Thursday, September 18, 2003. Retrieved July 1, 2012. Poll numbers in September showed a 3% drop in the number of California voters who were planning to vote yes on the recall.Chorneau, Tom. \"Campaign midpoint offers Davis last chance.\" Associated Press State & Local Wire.

According to some analysts and campaign aides, Davis's town hall meetings and conversations with voters were softening his image. Many political insiders remarked that Davis had made several comebacks and that he should not be counted out of the race despite poll numbers that showed over 50% planning to vote yes on the recall.\n\n's newspaper, the ''''.

Davis claimed that he would have rather raised taxes on the upper tax brackets instead of restoring vehicle registration fees and college student tuition.\n\nDavis called the recall a right-wing effort to rewrite history after having lost the election during the previous year. In a 19-minute campaign address that was broadcast statewide, Davis called the recall effort a \"right-wing power grab\" by Republicans. He blamed Republicans in the legislature and in Washington for many of the state's problems, while accepting some responsibility for those problems.\n\n said Davis about the recall.}}\n\nOn October 7, 2003, Davis was recalled. The recall was supported by 55.4% of voters. Republican  was elected to replace Davis as governor. The  and  were the only regions in California to vote \"no\" on the recall. Davis is the second governor in the history of the United States to have been recalled; the first was  of  in .\n\nOn the night of the recall, Davis conceded defeat and thanked California for having elected him in five statewide elections. Davis mentioned what he defined as the accomplishments of his administration such as improvements in education, environmental protection, and health insurance for children. Davis said he would help Schwarzenegger in the transition and he later urged his staff to do the same. His last day in office was November 17, 2003.\n\n\n]]\n\n\nIn December 2004, Davis announced that he was joining the law firm of Loeb & Loeb.\n\nDavis has done several media interviews about his legacy. He appeared prominently in the documentary ''''.\n\nThe debate about his legacy and role in the energy woes that proved to be his downfall remains. In a CNN interview on August 5, 2005, Davis expressed that he felt vindicated because of the revelation that Enron manipulated the California energy market and because of Schwarzenegger's then-low approval ratings. He also indicated that he had no interest in running for governor again, although he had been urged to run by some Democrats.\n\nDavis was a guest lecturer at UCLA's School of Public Policy in 2006 alongside former Republican State Senator . He wrote an introduction for a journalist's book on the  system for missing children, a cause he championed.\n\nOn April 23, 2007, Davis was appointed to the Board of Directors of animation company  as a non-executive.\n\nOn May 21, 2009, Davis was keynote speaker at the Columbia Law School graduation ceremony.\n\nIn September 2024, Davis was one of several former governors to sign an open letter to all 50 current governors urging them to certify their states’ votes after the upcoming November election.\n\n\nDavis's moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the Democratic Party. During the recall, Davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal Democratic base. He had a reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them. Davis's leadership and compromise-building skills have also been questioned. He was also hurt by redistricting in 2000 that made most districts safe for the incumbent party, limiting some legislators' need and willingness to compromise.\n\nWhen Davis was inaugurated as governor of California, he said, \"I'm a governor, not a judge\". Davis vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state, even the ones with which he personally disagreed. Davis defended  initially, but when it was declared unconstitutional by the , he did not appeal the decision.\n\nDavis's personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic. His personality forced him to depend more on political skills, such as fundraising, to win elections. Davis's tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service.\n\nAs Davis left office in 2003, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' published an editorial discussing his legacy. The newspaper claimed that he lacked vision, allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a \"robotic governing style\" that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships. The ''Chronicle'' commented that Davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate. Davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing. Davis never showed emotion to the voters. He spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision.\n\n\nDavis met his wife-to-be, Sharon Ryer, while on an airplane tending to official business in 1978.

The district includes most of southern and western . He previously represented the 42nd district from 1999 to 2013 (numbered as the 41st from 1993 to 2003). In February 2014, Miller announced he would step down at the next election.\n\n\nMiller was born in , but grew up in . He attended  in , and served briefly in the  in 1967 being discharged after seven weeks of boot camp at  near .\n\nHe is a businessman who founded several companies bearing his name, including G. Miller Development, G. Miller Masonry, and G. Miller Framing. At the age of 20, he began his first company, which built single-family and custom homes. His business expanded to the development of planned communities. Miller remains active in real estate through his development company.\n\n\n\n\nMiller was appointed to the , Municipal Advisory Council in 1988. In 1989, he was elected to the city's first council that helped incorporate the city. He served as mayor in 1992.\n\n\nIn 1990, he decided to run for a seat in the . Incumbent Republican State Senator  of  decided to resign. In the February 1990 special election (open primary), Miller ranked fourth, or last, among Republicans in the field, getting just 16% of the vote.\n\nIn 1994, he decided to run for the vacant . In the open primary in September 1994, he ranked second among Republicans getting 21% of the vote, behind State Representative , who ranked first with 45% of the vote.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1995, Miller ran in a special election for a seat in the  in the  after incumbent  was recalled. Miller won the open primary with 39% of the vote in a six candidate field.\n\nIn 1996, he won re-election defeating Democrat Susan Amaya 53–47%. He was succeeded in office by .\n\n\nHe was Chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.\n\n\n\n\nHe was elected to the U.S. House in 1998, defeating incumbent Republican and fellow Diamond Bar resident  in the primary and then Democrat Eileen Ansari in the general election with 53 percent. He won again in 2000 with 59 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2002 with 68 percent of the vote. In 2004, he defeated Democrat Lewis Myers with 71.5% of the vote per , the official county elections office website. Similarly, he won in 2008 with 63.8% of the vote, defeating Democrat Ed Chau.\n\nFor his first seven terms in Congress, Miller represented a district comprising portions of northern and eastern , southern  and a small portion of . After the , Miller's district was renumbered as the 39th district, and pushed further into Orange County, making this already strongly Republican seat even more so. The new map also placed the home of fellow Republican and 10-term incumbent  into the 39th, setting up what would have been the only primary contest between two California Republicans. Although the 39th was more Miller's district than Royce's (Miller retained 53 percent of his former territory), Royce was considered the stronger candidate. Partly due to this, Miller announced in January 2012 that he would run in the newly created 31st district, located entirely in San Bernardino County. Miller's move effectively ended the career of  chairman , who had represented a large slice of the new 31st. As part of the move, he bought a second home in , which he now claims as his official residence.\n\nOn paper, Miller faced daunting odds. He was running in a district that he had never represented before, had a sizable Democratic lean and was majority-Hispanic. Had it existed in 2008,  would have won it with 56 percent of the vote. However, due to California's new \"top-two\" primary system, the three Democrats in the field split the vote, allowing Miller to come in first with only 27 percent of the vote while a fellow Republican, State Senator  came in second with 25 percent while three Democrats split the remaining 48 percent of the vote. In the general election, Miller defeated Dutton with 55 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\n'''Transportation and infrastructure'''\n\nCongressman Miller was the most senior Republican from the California delegation on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. He served on the Highways and Transit; Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials; and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittees.\n\nIn 2005, Congressman Miller secured a provision in the 2005 SAFE-TEA LU Highway Reauthorization that initiated a pilot program where 5 states, including California would assume the responsibility for conducting the federal environmental review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In California, the NEPA pilot program has shaved 17 months off of environmental review processes and 30 months off of overall project delivery.\n\n;Streamlining regulations and review for transportation projects\nDuring the 112th Congress, Miller introduced legislation to build off the success of the 2005 pilot program to further improve highway project delivery by eliminating bureaucratic red tape and restoring greater control to state and local governments.\n\nIn June 2011, he introduced the Environmental Review Cooperation Act, which would make permanent a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) pilot program that authorizes five statesincluding Californiato take on the responsibility of complying with NEPA for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funded projects. The bill would also expand the program to all states that have environmental standards that are equal to or exceed federal requirements.\n\nIn August 2011, Congressman Miller introduced the Breaking Down Barriers Act, which provides common sense proposals to make highway project delivery more efficient. HR 2766, The Breaking Down Barriers Act includes language that allows transportation agencies to move forward on construction activities prior to receiving grant funds, and requires prompt action by federal agencies by establishing deadlines for project approvals.\n\n;Energy\nDuring the 111th Congress, Congressman Miller introduced a comprehensive energy bill that would reduce regulatory burdens that delay improvements and advancements in domestic energy production. The bill would open U.S. coastal waters for drilling, allow states to share a portion of the revenue derived from such drilling, and use the earnings from offshore drilling to pay down the national debt. The legislation also included energy tax incentives for wind, solar, biodiesel, clean coal technologies and other forms of energy. Congressman Miller stated his resolution and plan to lower gas prices and work for a long-term solution for the country.\n\nIn 2010 Miller signed a pledge sponsored by  promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.\n\n;Animal welfare\nDuring the 111th and 112th Congresses, Congressman Miller cosponsored the Puppy Uniform Protection Statute (PUPS) Act, which sets out to close loopholes in the 1966 law that allows breeders to sell puppies over the Internet without federal oversight. Specifically, this legislation requires any breeder who sells or offers to sell more than 50 dogs annually directly to the public, including over the Internet, to be licensed and inspected. The bill would also require that dogs in commercial breeding facilities have appropriate space and daily exercise.\n\nCongressman Miller was an original cosponsor of legislation in the 111th Congress to prohibit knowingly selling or offering to sell videos of animal crush videos in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial gain. This legislation, H.R. 5566, the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, was signed into law on December 9, 2010. In the 110th Congress, he sponsored the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, which imposes a fine and up to three years in jail for violations of the Animal Welfare Act related to sponsoring or exhibiting animals in an animal fighting venture and for buying, selling, or transporting any animal for participation in an animal fighting venture. This legislation became law on May 3, 2007.\n\n;Supporting breast cancer research\nCongressman Miller cosponsored legislation supporting Breast Cancer Deadline 2020, a call to action for policymakers, researchers, breast cancer advocates, and other stakeholders to end the disease by the end of the decade. H.R. 3067 would create a commission to identify promising research, encourage partnerships between government and the private sector, and create opportunities for trans-disciplinary collaboration that may advance the mission of ending breast cancer. Congressman Miller also cosponsored H.R. 466, legislation to reauthorize the sale of the Breast Cancer Stamp, with proceeds from the stamp going to the National Institute of Health to fund breast cancer research. Congressman Miller is also a long time supporter of the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program.\n\nDuring the 111th and 112th Congresses, Congressman Miller sent a letter to House Appropriations Committee requesting that appropriators include $120 million for the Department of Defense (DOD) Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP) in defense appropriations legislation.\n\n;Veterans\nCongressman Miller supports continuing the extension of benefits to all veterans of the armed services of the United States. During the 112th Congress, Congressman Miller cosponsored the Veteran Skills to Jobs Act, which addresses the high rate of veteran unemployment by streamlining the bureaucratic processes for veterans with relevant training to get jobs when they return home. Specifically, H.R. 4155 would direct federal agencies to view relevant military training as the equivalent of federal licensing and certification requirements.\n\nCongressman Miller also cosponsored H.R. 178, legislation to repeal the so-called \"Widow's Tax\" and ensure military widows and families of military heroes will be fully protected. H.R. 178, also known as the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act, would repeal current law that requires a dollar-for-dollar deduction of VA benefits for service connected deaths from military survivors' Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuity.\n\n'''Anti-terrorism'''\n\nIn 2005, Miller cosponsored the  (H.R. 4437) with representative . In 2006, after widespread demonstrations by immigrants, Miller wrote: \"Too bad their protest didn't include giving up government-paid social servicesbecause a day without illegal aliens would be a boon to U.S. taxpayers.\"\n\nMiller backed the development of a rail link between  and , part of a proposed  line between  and . \"Once completed, there would be no need for an airport in south Orange County, and the Inland Empire will reap the economic benefits as a true transportation hub,\" Miller said.\n\nMiller, a history buff, become involved in the preservation of  battlefields, after he played a bit part in the 2003 movie ''''.\n\nMiller signed the .\n\nIn 2011, Miller voted for the  as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.\n\n;Allegation of sheltering profits of real estate sales\nMiller sold  to the city of , in 2002, making profit of more than $10 million. Normally, he would have had to pay state and federal taxes of up to 31% on that profit.\n\nMiller told the  and the state of California that Monrovia had forced him to sell the property under threat of . That allowed him to shelter the profits from capital gains taxes for more than two years before he had to reinvest the money.\n\nMonrovia officials stated that Miller sold the land willingly and that they didn't threaten to force him to sell. A videotape of a February 2000 City Council meeting shows Miller asking city officials four times to buy his land. Another, earlier videotape confirmed Miller's position that the city had refused to let him develop the land and threatened \"condemnation\" of his property for public use. Although all early drafts of Monrovia's sales contract with Miller included the phrase \"friendly condemnation\", it was deleted when the final deal was made. Miller and his wife signed an amendment to the escrow instructions on August 1, 2002, saying, \"condemnation deleted\", or no longer in effect.\n\nMiller took an exemption again in 2005 when he sold the 10 lots to the city of  and again in 2006 when he sold a building to Fontana, claiming both were compulsory sales. The lots and building had been purchased in late 2004 with proceeds from the Monrovia sale. Such exemptions gave him another two years after each sale to reinvest the funds without paying capital gains taxes.\n\nIn each case, those involved in the purchases say eminent domain was neither used nor threatened. On January 31, 2007, the '''' reported that Miller's transactions are being investigated by the .\n\nMiller declined to comment on the sales. The FBI also declined to comment. As of 2008, no investigation or legal action could be confirmed.\n\n;2005 profits from dealings with business partner and federal transportation bill\nAs a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Miller pushed for a provision in the 2005 transportation bill that allowed the city of  to close its airport, the first time an act of Congress has ever shuttered an airport. It is a power the  traditionally has had sole authority to exercise. The closing of the airport paved the way for Lewis Operating, a business partner and campaign contributor, to win a multimillion-dollar contract from the city to develop the airport land and build a planned community consisting of 2,500 homes, parks and  of retail space on the former airport and adjacent land.\n\nMiller also helped secure $1.28 million in that bill for street improvements in front of a planned housing and retail center, including a  store that he co-owned with Lewis Operating.\n\nMiller took out nearly $7.5 million in promissory notes in 2004 from Lewis Operating, which he used to purchase land from the company. In 2005, he sold some of that land to a part of the company, making a profit of between $1.1 million and $6 million, according to his financial disclosure report (which requires reporting a dollar range, not an exact dollar figure). The majority of the parcels that Miller bought are about two miles (3&nbsp;km) from the airport.\n\nHouse Rules explicitly state that before entering into loans from an entity other than a financial institution, members of Congress and staff must submit the terms of the loans for review and a determination from the ethics committee on whether the loan is acceptable under the gift rule. It is not clear if Miller complied with this requirement.\n\n;December 2006 allegations\nIn December 2006, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Miller had used \"congressional muscle\" for \"personal business matters\".  This included having congressional staff do Miller's personal errands, collecting nearly $25,000 a year in rent from his campaign committee, using the offices of his real estate development firm as his campaign office, and ordering an aide to find a way to get a city business-friendly council member on the  who was involved in a city purchase of Miller's property.\n\n;May 2010 allegations\nIn May 2010, the ''FOX'' affiliate MyFOXLA interviewed Miller over claims led by  (CREW) stating he \"directed millions of dollars in government money to non-profits headed by one of his campaign contributor[s], developer Jeffrey Burum\". Burum, his company, and his wife donated $26,350 to Miller's campaign for what CREW alleges is over a million dollars in congressional earmarks kicked back to Burum's non-profit ''Hope Through Housing Foundation.''\n\n\n* ''''''\n** \n**  (Chairman)\n* ''''''\n** \n** \n** \n\n\n* Chairman of the Building a Better America Caucus\n* \n* \n* Congressional Cement Caucus\n\n\n\n\nRebecca Weir, a former staff member of Miller, claimed that he asked her to \"twirl for him\" after a meeting. According to Weir, \"He said, ‘My God, you look amazing today. Just stunning.’ And he was kind of leering at me, and then he asked me to twirl,\". Soon after the incident, Miller's Chief of Staff, called Ms. Weir to offer an ad-hoc bonus as instructed by Miller.\n\n\nMiller and his wife, Cathy, have three sons and one daughter.\n\n\nOn November 19, 2007, three of Miller's grandsons, Brian (8) and twins Evan and Christian (6), did not show for a scheduled joint-custody visit with their grandparents, the Millers. The Millers accused the boys' mother, Jennifer Lopez DeJongh, of abducting the children. DeJongh was divorced from Miller's son, Brian Miller, and the two were in dispute over certain custodial rights regarding medical and educational decisions for the children. Brian had previously pled guilty in 2000 to charges of spousal and child abuse. In 2006, prosecutors allowed him to change his plea to not guilty and dismissed the case after he completed probation, a parenting class, and 224 hours of community service. In August 2011, DeJongh and the boys were located in , . DeJongh was charged with three counts of child custody deprivation in , but federal charges of flight to avoid prosecution were dropped following her extradition. The children were reunited with the Miller family. Congressman Miller commented that, \"My wife and I are extremely relieved that after more than 3 1/2 years our grandchildren have been found unharmed and returned safely to the United States\" and that he was \"eternally grateful\" to the , the , the , Mexican authorities and \"all those whose hard work and unwavering dedication made this possible\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n*  at \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The channel reached 1million subscribers in December 2020 and had over 1.7million . His videos have discussed topics including real estate, the stock market, COVID-19 stimulus checks, , and . Paffrath also teaches online courses on the Teachable platform.\n\nSteven T. Wright publishing in the real estate website ''Curbed'' about \"landlord influencers\" included a profile of Paffrath. In the article, he described some of Paffrath's \"arguably incendiary opinions on landlord-tenant relations\", including Paffrath's requirement that his tenants have a  of 700 or higher, and his advice that property owners should mislead tenants by concealing the fact that they own the property, or are the sole owner.\n\nIn November 2020, Paffrath's channel and real estate career were featured on 's ''Millennial Money'', which publishes profiles of s and how they earn and spend their money. CNBC found that Paffrath earns most of his income from YouTube advertising revenue and , not real estate or stock market investing. Paffrath was among a group of finance YouTubers profiled by Adlan Jackson in a March 2021 '''' article, which discussed their shift during the  from offering advice on becoming multimillionaires towards creating videos to provide \"any little update\" on stimulus payments. In the article, Jackson said that Paffrath was \"exceptionally talented at talking to a camera, a natural salesman\", but also wrote that he was \"a multimillionaire landlord who once extolled the virtues of misleading tenants and vigorously refusing to rent to people with suboptimal credit scores\".\n\nIn August 2021, CNBC reported that Paffrath earned close to $10million from YouTube over the last 12 months.\n\nIn November 2022, after the collapse of the  cryptocurrency exchange, Paffrath posted an apology video in which he claimed he was paid $2,500 every time he mentioned FTX in one of his videos. He believed he had one of the smaller deals and claimed other influencers had six-figure deals with the exchange. In a telephone interview with '''' from a cruise with family, he said, \"If I could go back in time, I would undo it all in a heartbeat. We failed here. Everybody was fooled\". Paffrath claimed the income from the FTX deal only accounted for three percent of his total income for the year.

One video was entitled \"Dave Ramsey: Exposed\" where Paffrath claimed Ramsey's business provided \"cold-as-ice \" for real estate sales and collected a fee for \"doing nothing\". Paffrath stated that he had ended his relationship with Ramsey Solutions before making the videos and believed he did not violate a contract. Paffrath also claimed the lawsuit was an attempt at censorship which violated his . The case moved to federal court in 2019, and was settled privately out of court later that year. Paffrath's videos mentioned in the lawsuit are no longer on YouTube.\n\nPaffrath made numerous YouTube videos criticizing the business model of real estate personality Grant Cardone. In an effort to bring more attention to his other videos, in 2018, Paffrath delivered flowers to Cardone's office staff while dressed as a , reportedly running through Cardone's offices. Paffrath was charged with  and , but the charges were later dismissed. In a May 2021 interview with  discussing his gubernatorial candidacy, Paffrath expressed regret for the \"YouTube prank\" and said he had gotten \"carried away with the entertainment aspect of YouTube\".\n\nPaffrath was amongst a number of finance YouTube stars who were sued in a class action lawsuit filed March 15, 2023 in the Southern District of Florida in relation to their alleged promotion of the cryptocurrency exchange . The suit alleged that Kevin Paffrath amongst a number of other defendants “promoted, assisted in, and/or participated in” the sale of “unregistered securities” by FTX. Paffrath subsequently agreed the terms of a settlement for his part in the case, the details of which have not yet been disclosed.\n\n\n\nOn May 17, 2021, Paffrath announced his candidacy as a Democrat in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election, which was held on September 14, 2021, and ultimately resulted in sitting governor Gavin Newsom not being recalled. Paffrath was one of nine Democratic candidates to replace Newsom who qualified to appear on the ballot, out of 46 total candidates; the thin pool of Democrats was attributed to the 's strategy, which focused on defeating the recall and discouraged established Democratic candidates from entering the race.\n\n briefly removed Paffrath's campaign announcement post from their platform. According to Paffrath, Instagram notified him that they had removed his post, in which he described Newsom as a \"weanie baby\", under its harassment guidelines. Paffrath told  he suspected the post was taken down intentionally and that the removal was related to its parent company 's donations to Newsom's causes. A Facebook spokesperson said the company's donations had gone towards coronavirus relief, not the governor's campaign. The ''Los Angeles Times'' has reported that such donations by Facebook and other social media companies were \"behested\" payments, or indirect payments to government causes on Newsom's behalf. Shortly after Fox News inquired about the removal of the post, it was restored, and a spokesperson said it had been removed in error.\n\nPaffrath sued the Secretary of State of California to allow him to be listed on the ballot as \"Kevin 'Meet Kevin' Paffrath\". The court denied his petition on July 21, finding that \"Meet Kevin\" was nonetheless a brand and not a nickname or formal name.\n\nIn August 2021, Paffrath's attorneys sent a  letter to CNN related to their reporting that \"no Democrats are competing against their own party's governor.\" Fox News reported the CNN article was subsequently revised to state, \"no party-backed Democrats are competing against their own party's governor\" and suggested CNN should have been aware of Paffrath from recent press coverage.\n\n61.9% of voters opposed recalling Newsom. In the ballot question asking which candidate should replace Newsom if the recall was successful, Paffrath came in second place to Republican , with around 706,000 votes (9.6%) to Elder's 3.5million (48.4%).\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He is a member of the .\n\nBilbray was Chairman of the  and a member of the influential . His subcommittee assignments on the Energy and Commerce Committee were as follows: Oversight and Investigations, Communication and Technology, and Energy and Power.\n\n\nBilbray was born in , and grew up in . He graduated from , where he played on the football team as a , and attended , a  in . He worked as a tax consultant before entering politics. A , he and his wife, Karen (née Walker), have five children, one of whom, Brian Pat, is a current member of the Imperial Beach city council.\n\nBilbray is a cousin of former   Representative .\n\nAn avid surfer, he has compared surfing to politics.\n\n\nBilbray became interested in politics when an extensive program of eminent domain was proposed for . He ran successfully for the city council as a , serving during 1976–1978, and was mayor during 1978–1985.\n\nAs mayor, Bilbray attempted to build a yacht marina in the Tijuana Estuary and to build a 1.5 mile breakwater off the beach of Imperial Beach. Both projects were stopped by the opposition of local surfers and environmentalists. The  Estuary is now a  and . The breakwater project was halted with the help of the then fledgling . From 1985 to 1995, Bilbray was a member of the  .\n\n\nIn 1994, Bilbray won the Republican nomination for the , now the 53rd district, which included most of , and defeated freshman   in the Republican landslide of that year. The 53rd was one of several marginal districts to go Republican in that cycle. Bilbray was reelected in 1996 and 1998. In 2000, he was defeated by  . \n\n\nIn 2001, Bilbray registered as a federal lobbyist. His clients included ; the ; the San Diego Regional Airport Authority; Conquer Cancer and Alzheimer's Now; ; and . \n\nBilbray is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of .\n\n\n\n\n\nBilbray ran in the 2006 special election to fill the vacancy in  caused by the resignation in December 2005 of fellow Republican , who pleaded guilty to felony charges of conspiracy and tax evasion, and subsequently went to jail. In March 2005, Bilbray moved to , to take care of his mother, who owns a home there.\n\nThe race to assume Cunningham's seat was highly contested, especially on the Republican side, with 14 Republicans (compared with only 2 Democrats) officially running for the position. Leading up to the initial all-candidate election that would determine the parties' candidates in a runoff election, Bilbray was in a virtual tie with Republican businessman Eric Roach, slightly ahead of former State Assemblyman . Four days before the election, businessman Alan Uke, one of the major Republican candidates, ran an attack ad accusing Roach of  thousands of jobs at the expense of American workers. In the initial all-party special election on April 11, 2006, Bilbray was the Republican candidate with the most votes, receiving 15% of the total vote to Roach's 15%. He then faced the top vote getters of all the other parties in a  on June 6, 2006: Democrat ,  Paul King, and William Griffith, an independent.\n\nDuring the campaign, Arizona Senator  canceled a planned fundraiser for Bilbray at the last minute, after Bilbray called McCain's immigration bill \"amnesty\" for illegal immigrants.\n\nBilbray won the runoff with 49% of the vote, and was sworn in on June 13, 2006, as a member of the Congress. The Republican Party considered this a  race because this district had \"the perfect storm in favor of the Democrats\" according to , the RNC Chairman at the time of the special election. The 's Voting Rights Institute raised several concerns about the fairness and accuracy of the vote count. An election contest lawsuit sought a hand recount.\n\nHowever, Bilbray was sworn in before the vote count was official. The court dismissed the suit on the basis that, once the House of Representatives had sworn in Bilbray, the court lacked  to hear the challenge.\n\n\nBilbray and Busby each won their party's primary, and faced each other again in the November general election. Bilbray defeated Busby by a margin of 54%–44%. Bilbray ran as an  opponent of illegal immigration. With the advantage of incumbency and the Republican edge in registrations in the district, Bilbray was initially a clear favorite to win in November. Both the ''Cook Political Report'' and ''CQPolitics'' first rated the race as ''Republican Favored''. But Busby gained in October, with a late-October poll by SurveyUSA showed Bilbray ahead by just 3 points, for a number of reasons: the general political climate seen as disadvantageous to the GOP, Busby's outraising Bilbray, and Bilbray's low profile campaign. On October 23, ''CQPolitics'' changed their rating to ''Leans Republican''.\n\n\nRunning unopposed in the June primary, Bilbray overcame a strong challenge from Democrat  in the November . With help from the  and $1 million in donations, Leibham ran a string of TV attack ads against Bilbray. Democrats thought they had a chance at winning the district due to the hostile environment plaguing Republicans in general, and shifting demographics locally. Bilbray won, 50% to 46%, with 4% of the vote going to  candidate Wayne Dunlap.\n\n\n\nDue to district realignment after the 2010 census, Bilbray  as the incumbent in the  in 2012. An all-parties primary was held on June 5, 2012. A runoff between Bilbray and  Commissioner , a , was held on November 6. The initial vote was very close, so that a winner was not declared until ten days after the election as provisional ballots were counted. On November 16, with Peters ahead by 51% to 49%, Bilbray conceded defeat.\n\n\nSince his loss to Congresswoman Susan Davis in 2000, Bilbray has maintained residences and properties in ; ; and . In response to requests to District Attorney , by the local Democratic Party and neighbors of the congressman, a San Diego County  was convened to investigate claims against Bilbray's declared residency for the special and general elections in 2006. The investigation was dropped in May 2007.\n\nQuestions about Bilbray's residency again arose after his reelection on November 6, 2010, when he personally, as well as his children Briana and Patrick, claimed to not live in California and not qualify for in-state tuition in a class-action lawsuit against the University of California. Brian Bilbray appeared as a named plaintiff residing in Virginia.\n\n\n\nDuring the 109th Congress Bilbray served on the House Armed Services, Veterans Affairs and Government Reform Committees. During his first term Bilbray co-authored legislation that led to the transfer of the Mount Soledad Veteran's Memorial from the City of San Diego to the federal government. He also authored legislation that would have reformed the federal budget process.\n\nBilbray positioned himself as moderate on some social issues while conservative on immigration and fiscal matters. He is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.\n\nDuring his second run for Congress in the 50th district, Bilbray won over many of the district's most conservative voters with his hard line stance on illegal immigration.  Since then Bilbray's voting record has been considerably more conservative than it was during his first term. He is a member of both the moderate  and the conservative , two groups with conflicting positions on policy. For example, the RMSP supports embryonic stem cell research and opposes the , while the RSC opposes embryonic stem cell research and supports the FMA. He is also a member of .\n\nBilbray voted in agreement with President  93% of the time, and as a result was given a 93% Presidential Support Score by  in 2006. He served multiple terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. He represented California's 49th congressional district, which includes parts of San Diego County. He was elected to Congress in a special election in 2006 and subsequently reelected.\n\nIn October 2011, Bilbray voted for a bill that would prohibit public funding for abortions. It passed 251–172 in the House. Bilbray almost always has voted for free trade agreements in the past years, specifically with Korea, Colombia, and Panama, all of which passed.  The following month, he introduced  a new bill which would benefit veterans. It provides job training and internships paid for by federal grants.\n\nIn 2011, he voted for the  as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and/or the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.\n\n\n* ''''''\n** \n** \n** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*  ''official U.S. House website''\n*  ''official campaign website''\n* \n* \n*  ''Swing'' magazine, March 1996\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n''|years=}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the campaign, Ayala noted that two-thirds of the $130,000 that Lewis raised came from 43 donors  22 of whom were  lobbyists.\n\n\n]]\n\n\n\nIn November 1978, Lewis was elected as a Republican to the , in what was then the 37th Congressional district, with 61% of the vote. He was subsequently re-elected 16 times. He never won re-election with less than 61% of the vote. In fact, he only dipped below 65% four times (1990, 1992, 2006, and 2008).\n\nIn 2008, Lewis received his strongest challenge in decades from San Bernardino attorney Tim Prince, who won a 4-candidate Democratic primary. Lewis was forced to spend over a million dollars to retain his seat. He declined Prince's challenges for a debate. The incumbent defeated him with 62% of the vote.\n\nOn January 12, 2012, Lewis announced his retirement.\n\n\nLewis employed his wife, Arlene Willis, as the chief of staff in his office. Before they were married, Willis was her husband's top aide when he came to  in 1979.\n\nIn 1994, he was named chairman of the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee, where he worked until 1999 to improve oversight to uncover fraud and abuse in large housing programs and reduce spending on wasteful programs within a number of federal agencies.\n\nHe steered federal dollars to the state and to the region for projects such as the planning and construction of the  near . Among his proudest achievements came early in his career as a state assemblyman, pushing for the establishment of the first air quality committee in the state Legislature, which led to the formation of the South Coast Air Quality Management District in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1998, he secured start-up funding for 's Proton Beam treatment center, which has led to the installation of similar cancer treatment centers across the U.S.\n\nLewis placed special riders in a series of appropriations bills that freed up nearly $100 million to the , the state and the county to remove more than a million trees in the San Bernardino National Forest killed by drought and bark beetle infestation. He worked with U.S. Senator  to secure an additional $500 million to reduce the fire danger in the  and throughout .\n\nLewis also secured $15 million for a pilot program to refurbish houses repossessed by the  and providing them to qualified low income families. The program, according to Lewis' office at the time was successful in Redlands, Highland, and San Bernardino.\n\n\nLewis was a member of the  and supported .

It was never submitted to federal prosecutors.\n\n\nLewis' aide in charge of tracking defense appropriations, Marine Lt. Col. Carl Kime, was \"a military officer on 's payroll, an apparent violation of House rules and a possible conflict of interest\".  regulations state that military personnel can work on committee staffs but not on the personal staff of an individual member. Kime apparently worked for Lewis since 2001 while being on the Pentagon payroll. Congressional watchdogs call Kime's role a conflict of interest and defense experts state that his position may have given the  greater leverage over contracts and earmarks on the Appropriations Committee.\n\nOn February 22, 2006, '''' reported that the Pentagon was recalling Kime from Lewis's office. Kime's \"service for Lewis appeared to violate the Members' Congressional Handbook issued by the Committee for House Administration, which defines a detailee as a 'non-congressional federal employee assigned to a committee for a period of up to one year.' The handbook also states that 'detailees may not be assigned to a member office' and cites the relevant section of U.S. law: 2 USC Section 72a(f).\"\n\n\nIn July 2007, '''' reported that since 2004, Lewis had earmarked $2.75 million for the \"\" area of Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. \"Neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project,\" Lewis said of the improvements being funded by the earmarks. But the congressman's wife, who was also his chief of staff, owns a three-bedroom home valued at $943,000 that is four blocks from the work being paid for by the earmarks. CBS also reported that Tip Tipton, a property owner in the area and a member of the board of directors of the redevelopment project receiving the earmarks, is a top Washington lobbyist who is also a longtime Lewis friend and campaign donor.\n\n\nFrom 1998 to 2003,  received $167.2 million in congressional earmarks. That made it the number one academic recipient in the country, with its total nearly $60 million more than the runner up, the . In 2000, Loma Linda University was the single largest recipient of higher education earmarks, at $36 million, largely brought in by Lewis. Several grants were from the , including $5 million from  for space radiation research.\n\nIn 2008, Loma Linda University received nearly $9.5 million, of which $5 million came from the Defense Department.\n\n\nLewis was chair of the  from 1989 to 1992. In January 1995, he became chairman of the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development  and Independent Agencies Appropriations subcommittee. He was the first representative from California to be chairman of the powerful .
